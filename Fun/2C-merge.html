<strong>2C-merge</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>two-column.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(2C-merge)</br>
</br>
Merges the associated buffer with the current buffer.</br>
They get merged at the column, which is the value of `2C-window-width',</br>
i.e. usually at the vertical window separator.  This separator gets</br>
replaced with white space.  Beyond that the value of `2C-separator' gets</br>
inserted on merged lines.  The two columns are thus pasted side by side,</br>
in a single text.  If the other buffer is not displayed to the left of</br>
this one, then this one becomes the left column.</br>
</br>
If you want `2C-separator' on empty lines in the second column,</br>
you should put just one space in them.  In the final result, you can strip</br>
off trailing spaces with M-x delete-trailing-whitespace.
