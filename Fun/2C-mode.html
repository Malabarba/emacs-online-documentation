</br>
(2C-mode <u>OTHER</u>)</br>
</br>
Minor mode for independently editing two columns.</br>
This is set up for two associated buffers by the three commands bound</br>
to  C-x 6 2 ,  C-x 6 b  and  C-x 6 s.</br>
Turning on two-column mode calls the value of the variable `2C-mode-hook',</br>
if that value is non-nil.</br>
</br>
These buffers can be edited separately, for example with `fill-paragraph'.</br>
If you want to disable parallel scrolling temporarily, use  M-x 2C-toggle-autoscroll .</br>
</br>
If you include long lines that span both columns (e.g., source</br>
code), they should be in what will be the first column, with the</br>
associated buffer having empty lines next to them.</br>
</br>
Potential uses are writing bilingual texts, or editing the comments of a</br>
source code.  See the file lisp/two-column.el for detailed examples.</br>
</br>
You have the following commands at your disposal:</br>
</br>
C-x 6 2   Rearrange screen with current buffer first</br>
C-x 6 b   Reassociate buffer after changing major mode</br>
C-x {, C-x }   Shrink, enlarge current column</br>
M-x 2C-associated-buffer   Switch to associated buffer at same point</br>
M-x 2C-newline Insert newline(s) in both buffers at same point</br>
M-x 2C-merge   Merge both buffers</br>
M-x 2C-dissociate   Dissociate the two buffers</br>
</br>
These keybindings can be customized in your init file by</br>
`2C-mode-map', `2C-minor-mode-map' and by binding `2C-command' to</br>
some prefix.</br>
</br>
The appearance of the screen can be customized by the variables</br>
`2C-window-width', `2C-beyond-fill-column', `2C-mode-line-format' and</br>
`truncate-partial-width-windows'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
