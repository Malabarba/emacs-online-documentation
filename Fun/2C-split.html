<strong>2C-split</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>two-column.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;f2> s, C-x 6 s.</br>
</br>
<code>(2C-split <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Split a two-column text at point, into two buffers in two-column minor mode.</br>
Point becomes the local value of `2C-window-width'.  Only lines that</br>
have the <u>ARG</u> same preceding characters at that column get split.  The</br>
<u>ARG</u> preceding characters without any leading whitespace become the local</br>
value for `2C-separator'.  This way lines that continue across both</br>
columns remain untouched in the first buffer.</br>
</br>
This function can be used with a prototype line, to set up things.  You</br>
write the first line of each column and then split that line.  E.g.:</br>
</br>
First column's text    sSs  Second column's text</br>
		       \___/\</br>
			/    \</br>
   5 character Separator      You type  M-5 C-x 6 s  with the point here.</br>
