2C-split is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `two-column.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <f2> s, C-x 6 s.<br/><br/>(2C-split ARG)<br/><br/>Split a two-column text at point, into two buffers in two-column minor mode.<br/>Point becomes the local value of `2C-window-width'.  Only lines that<br/>have the ARG same preceding characters at that column get split.  The<br/>ARG preceding characters without any leading whitespace become the local<br/>value for `2C-separator'.  This way lines that continue across both<br/>columns remain untouched in the first buffer.<br/><br/>This function can be used with a prototype line, to set up things.  You<br/>write the first line of each column and then split that line.  E.g.:<br/><br/>First column's text    sSs  Second column's text<br/>		       \___/\<br/>			/    \<br/>   5 character Separator      You type  M-5 C-x 6 s  with the point here.<br/><br/>(See  C-h m .)
