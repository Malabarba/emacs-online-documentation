<strong>2C-two-columns</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>two-column.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;f2> &lt;f2>, &lt;f2> 2, C-x 6 &lt;f2>, C-x 6 2.</br>
</br>
<code>(2C-two-columns <em>&optional</em> <u>BUFFER</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Split current window vertically for two-column editing.</br>
When called the first time, associates a buffer with the current</br>
buffer in two-column minor mode (use C-h m once in the mode,</br>
for details.).  It runs `2C-other-buffer-hook' in the new buffer.</br>
When called again, restores the screen layout with the current buffer</br>
first and the associated buffer to its right.
