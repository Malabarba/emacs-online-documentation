</br>
</br>
(5x5-solve-rotate-left &optional <u>N</u>)</br>
</br>
Rotate left by <u>N</u> the list of solutions in 5x5-solver-output.</br>
</br>
If <u>N</u> is not supplied rotate by 1, that is to say put the last</br>
element first in the list.</br>
</br>
The 5x5 game has in general several solutions.  For grid size=5,</br>
there are 4 possible solutions.  When function</br>
`5x5-solve-suggest' (press `M-x 5x5-solve-suggest') is called the</br>
solution that is presented is the one that needs least number of</br>
strokes --- other solutions can be viewed by rotating through the</br>
list. The list of solution is ordered by number of strokes, so</br>
rotating left just after calling `5x5-solve-suggest' will show</br>
the solution with second least number of strokes, while rotating</br>
right will show the solution with greatest number of strokes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
