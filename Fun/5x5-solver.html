<strong>5x5-solver</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>5x5.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(5x5-solver <u>GRID</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a list of solutions for <u>GRID</u>.</br>
</br>
Given some grid <u>GRID</u>, the returned a list of solution LIST is</br>
sorted from least Hamming weight to greatest one.</br>
</br>
   LIST = (SOLUTION-1 ... SOLUTION-N)</br>
</br>
Each solution SOLUTION-I is a cons cell (HW . G) where HW is the</br>
Hamming weight of the solution --- ie the number of strokes to</br>
achieve it --- and G is the grid of positions to click in order</br>
to complete the 5x5.</br>
</br>
Solutions are sorted from least to greatest Hamming weight.
