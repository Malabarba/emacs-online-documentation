</br>
</br>
(Buffer-menu-mode)</br>
</br>
Parent mode: `tabulated-list-mode'.</br>
</br>
Major mode for Buffer Menu buffers.</br>
The Buffer Menu is invoked by the commands C-x C-b,</br>
M-x buffer-menu, and M-x buffer-menu-other-window.</br>
See `buffer-menu' for a description of its contents.</br>
</br>
In Buffer Menu mode, the following commands are defined:</br>
</br>
q    Remove the Buffer Menu from the display.</br>
RET  Select current line's buffer in place of the buffer menu.</br>
o    Select that buffer in another window,</br>
     so the Buffer Menu remains visible in its window.</br>
V    Select current line's buffer, in View mode.</br>
M-x Buffer-menu-view-other-window  Select that buffer in</br>
     another window, in view-mode.</br>
C-o  Make another window display that buffer.</br>
m    Mark current line's buffer to be displayed.</br>
v    Select current line's buffer.</br>
     Also show buffers marked with m, in other windows.</br>
1    Select that buffer in full-frame window.</br>
2    Select that buffer in one window, together with the</br>
     buffer selected before this one in another window.</br>
M-s a C-s    Incremental search in the marked buffers.</br>
M-s a C-M-s  Isearch for regexp in the marked buffers.</br>
M-s a C-o Show lines matching regexp in the marked buffers.</br>
t    visit-tags-table this buffer.</br>
~    Clear modified-flag on that buffer.</br>
s    Mark that buffer to be saved, and move down.</br>
C-k  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move down.</br>
C-d  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move up.</br>
x    Delete or save marked buffers.</br>
u    Remove all marks from current line.</br>
     With prefix argument, also move up one line.</br>
DEL  Back up a line and remove marks.</br>
%    Toggle read-only status of buffer on this line.</br>
g    Update the list of buffers.</br>
T    Toggle whether the menu displays only file buffers.</br>
b    Bury the buffer listed on this line.</br>
</br>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `tabulated-list-mode' might have run,</br>
this mode runs the hook `Buffer-menu-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
