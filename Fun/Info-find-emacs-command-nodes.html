<strong>Info-find-emacs-command-nodes</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>info.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(Info-find-emacs-command-nodes COMMAND)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of locations documenting COMMAND.<br/>
The `info-file' property of COMMAND says which Info manual to search.<br/>
If COMMAND has no property, the variable `Info-file-list-for-emacs'<br/>
defines heuristics for which Info manual to try.<br/>
The locations are of the format used in `Info-history', i.e.<br/>
(FILENAME NODENAME BUFFERPOS), where BUFFERPOS is the line number<br/>
in the first element of the returned list (which is treated specially in<br/>
`Info-goto-emacs-command-node'), and 0 for the rest elements of a list.
