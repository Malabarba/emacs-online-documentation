<strong>Info-find-in-tag-table</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>info.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(Info-find-in-tag-table <u>MARKER</u> <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>STRICT-CASE</u>)</br>
</br>
Find a node in a tag table.</br>
<u>MARKER</u> specifies the buffer and position to start searching at.</br>
<u>REGEXP</u> is a regular expression matching nodes or references.  Its first</br>
group should match `Node:' or `Ref:'.</br>
If a match was found, value is a list (FOUND-ANCHOR POS MODE), where</br>
FOUND-ANCHOR is non-nil if a `Ref:' was matched, POS is the position</br>
where the match was found, and MODE is `major-mode' of the buffer in</br>
which the match was found.</br>
This function tries to find a case-sensitive match first, then a</br>
case-insensitive match is tried (unless optional argument <u>STRICT-CASE</u></br>
is non-nil).
