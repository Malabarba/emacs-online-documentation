</br>
(Info-find-node-in-buffer <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>STRICT-CASE</u>)</br>
</br>
Find a node or anchor in the current buffer.</br>
<u>REGEXP</u> is a regular expression matching nodes or references.  Its first</br>
group should match `Node:' or `Ref:'.</br>
Value is the position at which a match was found, or nil if not found.</br>

a case-insensitive match is tried (unless optional argument <u>STRICT-CASE</u></br>
is non-nil).
