(Info-index-nodes &optional FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of names of all index nodes in Info FILE.<br/>

First look in a list of cached index node names.  Then scan Info<br/>
file and its subfiles for nodes with the index cookie.  Then try<br/>
to find index nodes starting from the first node in the top level<br/>
menu whose name contains the word "Index", plus any immediately<br/>
following nodes whose names also contain the word "Index".
