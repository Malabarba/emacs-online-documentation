</br>
</br>
(Info-mode)</br>
</br>
Info mode provides commands for browsing through the Info documentation tree.</br>
Documentation in Info is divided into "nodes", each of which discusses</br>
one topic and contains references to other nodes which discuss related</br>
topics.  Info has commands to follow the references and show you other nodes.</br>
</br>
h	Invoke the Info tutorial.</br>
q	Quit Info: reselect previously selected buffer.</br>
</br>
Selecting other nodes:</br>
&lt;mouse-2></br>
	Follow a node reference you click on.</br>
	  This works with menu items, cross references, and</br>
	  the "next", "previous" and "up", depending on where you click.</br>
RET	Follow a node reference near point, like &lt;mouse-2>.</br>
n	Move to the "next" node of this node.</br>
p	Move to the "previous" node of this node.</br>
^	Move "up" from this node.</br>
m	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).</br>
	  Picking a menu item causes another node to be selected.</br>
d	Go to the Info directory node.</br>
&lt;	Go to the Top node of this file.</br>
>	Go to the final node in this file.</br>
[	Go backward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.</br>
]	Go forward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.</br>
TAB	Move cursor to next cross-reference or menu item.</br>
C-M-i	Move cursor to previous cross-reference or menu item.</br>
f	Follow a cross reference.  Reads name of reference.</br>
l	Move back in history to the last node you were at.</br>
r	Move forward in history to the node you returned from after using l.</br>
L	Go to menu of visited nodes.</br>
T	Go to table of contents of the current Info file.</br>
</br>
Moving within a node:</br>
SPC	Normally, scroll forward a full screen.</br>
	  Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the</br>
	  screen but after point, the next scroll moves into its first</br>
	  subnode.  When after all menu items (or if there is no menu),</br>
	  move up to the parent node.</br>
DEL	Normally, scroll backward.  If the beginning of the buffer is</br>
	  already visible, try to go to the previous menu entry, or up</br>
	  if there is none.</br>
b	Go to beginning of node.</br>
</br>
Advanced commands:</br>
s	Search through this Info file for specified regexp,</br>
	  and select the node in which the next occurrence is found.</br>
S	Search through this Info file for specified regexp case-sensitively.</br>
C-s, C-M-s	Use Isearch to search through multiple Info nodes.</br>
i	Search for a topic in this manual's Index and go to index entry.</br>
,	(comma) Move to the next match from a previous i command.</br>
I	Look for a string and display the index node with results.</br>
M-x info-apropos	Look for a string in the indices of all manuals.</br>
g	Move to node specified by name.</br>
	  You may include a filename as well, as (FILENAME)NODENAME.</br>
1 .. 9	Pick first ... ninth item in node's menu.</br>
	  Every third `*' is highlighted to help pick the right number.</br>
c	Put name of current Info node in the kill ring.</br>
M-n	Select a new cloned Info buffer in another window.</br>
C-u C-h i	Move to new Info file with completion.</br>
C-u N C-h i	Select Info buffer with prefix number in the name *info*&lt;N>.</br>
</br>
This mode runs the hook `Info-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
