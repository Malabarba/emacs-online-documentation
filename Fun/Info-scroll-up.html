Info-scroll-up is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `info.el'.<br/><br/>(Info-scroll-up)<br/><br/>Scroll one screenful forward in Info, considering all nodes as one sequence.<br/>Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the screen<br/>but after point, the next scroll moves into its first subnode, unless<br/>`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is nil.<br/><br/>When you scroll past the end of a node, that goes to the next node if<br/>`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is non-nil and to the first subnode otherwise;<br/>if this node has no successor, it moves to the parent node's successor,<br/>and so on.  If `Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is non-nil and point is inside<br/>the menu of a node, it moves to subnode indicated by the following menu<br/>item.  (That case won't normally result from this command, but can happen<br/>in other ways.)
