</br>
</br>
(Info-scroll-up)</br>
</br>
Scroll one screenful forward in Info, considering all nodes as one sequence.</br>
Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the screen</br>
but after point, the next scroll moves into its first subnode, unless</br>
`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is nil.</br>
</br>
When you scroll past the end of a node, that goes to the next node if</br>
`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is non-nil and to the first subnode otherwise;</br>
if this node has no successor, it moves to the parent node's successor,</br>
and so on.  If `Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes' is non-nil and point is inside</br>
the menu of a node, it moves to subnode indicated by the following menu</br>
item.  (That case won't normally result from this command, but can happen</br>
in other ways.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
