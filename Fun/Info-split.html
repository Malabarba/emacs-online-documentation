Info-split is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `informat.el'.<br/><br/>(Info-split)<br/><br/>Split an info file into an indirect file plus bounded-size subfiles.<br/>Each subfile will be up to the number of characters that<br/>`Info-split-threshold' specifies, plus one node.<br/><br/>To use this command, first visit a large Info file that has a tag<br/>table.  The buffer is modified into a (small) indirect info file which<br/>should be saved in place of the original visited file.<br/><br/>The subfiles are written in the same directory the original file is<br/>in, with names generated by appending `-' and a number to the original<br/>file name.  The indirect file still functions as an Info file, but it<br/>contains just the tag table and a directory of subfiles.
