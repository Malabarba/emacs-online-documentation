<strong>Man-parse-man-k</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>man.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(Man-parse-man-k)</br>
</br>
Parse "man -k" output and return the list of page names.</br>
</br>
The current buffer should contain the output of a command of the</br>
form "man -k keyword", which is traditionally also available with</br>
apropos(1).</br>
</br>
While POSIX man(1p) is a bit vague about what to expect here,</br>
this function tries to parse some commonly used formats, which</br>
can be described in the following informal way, with square brackets</br>
indicating optional parts and whitespace being interpreted</br>
somewhat loosely.</br>
</br>
foo[, bar [, ...]] [other stuff] (sec) - description</br>
foo(sec)[, bar(sec) [, ...]] [other stuff] - description</br>
