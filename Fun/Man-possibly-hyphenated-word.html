<strong>Man-possibly-hyphenated-word</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>man.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(Man-possibly-hyphenated-word)</br>
</br>
Return a possibly hyphenated word at point.</br>
If the word starts at the first non-whitespace column, and the</br>
previous line ends with a hyphen, return the last word on the previous</br>
line instead.  Thus, if a reference to "tcgetpgrp(3V)" is hyphenated</br>
as "tcgetp-grp(3V)", and point is at "grp(3V)", we return</br>
"tcgetp-" instead of "grp".
