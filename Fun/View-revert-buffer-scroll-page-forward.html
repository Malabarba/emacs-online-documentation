</br>
</br>
(View-revert-buffer-scroll-page-forward &optional <u>LINES</u>)</br>
</br>
Scroll forward, reverting buffer if needed, in View mode.</br>
If buffer has not been changed and the corresponding file is newer, first</br>
revert the buffer, then scroll.</br>
This command is useful if you are viewing a changing file.</br>
</br>
The prefix argument <u>LINES</u> says how many lines to scroll.</br>
If you don't specify a prefix argument, it uses the number of lines set by</br>
M-x View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size or</br>
M-x View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size.</br>
If <u>LINES</u> is more than a window-full, only the last window-full is shown.
