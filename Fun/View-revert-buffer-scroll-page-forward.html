<strong>View-revert-buffer-scroll-page-forward</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(View-revert-buffer-scroll-page-forward &optional LINES)<br/>
<br/>
Scroll forward, reverting buffer if needed, in View mode.<br/>
If buffer has not been changed and the corresponding file is newer, first<br/>
revert the buffer, then scroll.<br/>
This command is useful if you are viewing a changing file.<br/>
<br/>
The prefix argument LINES says how many lines to scroll.<br/>
If you don't specify a prefix argument, it uses the number of lines set by<br/>
M-x View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size or<br/>
M-x View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size.<br/>
If LINES is more than a window-full, only the last window-full is shown.
