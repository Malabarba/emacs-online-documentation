<strong>View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size &optional LINES)<br/>
<br/>
Scroll forward LINES lines in View mode, setting the "page size".<br/>
This is the number of lines which M-x View-scroll-page-forward and<br/>
M-x View-scroll-page-backward scroll by default.<br/>
If LINES is omitted or = 0, sets "page size" to window height and<br/>
scrolls forward that much, otherwise scrolls forward LINES lines and sets<br/>
"page size" to the minimum of window height and the absolute value of LINES.<br/>
