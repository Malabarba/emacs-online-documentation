</br>
Characters @ and ! are special at the beginning of <u>REGEXP</u>.  They modify</br>

@ means search all the buffer i.e. start search at the beginning of buffer.</br>
! means search for a line that contains no match for the pattern.</br>

an earlier remembered <u>REGEXP</u> is used, otherwise <u>REGEXP</u> is remembered</br>
for use by later search commands.</br>

The variable `view-highlight-face' controls the face that is used</br>
for highlighting the match that is found.
