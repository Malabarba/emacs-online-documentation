(abbrev-symbol ABBREV &optional TABLE)<br/>
<br/>
Return the symbol representing abbrev named ABBREV.<br/>

it is interned in an abbrev-table rather than the normal obarray.<br/>
The value is nil if that abbrev is not defined.<br/>
Optional second arg TABLE is abbrev table to look it up in.<br/>
The default is to try buffer's mode-specific abbrev table, then global table.
