accept-process-output is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(accept-process-output &optional PROCESS SECONDS MILLISEC JUST-THIS-ONE)<br/><br/>Allow any pending output from subprocesses to be read by Emacs.<br/>It is read into the process' buffers or given to their filter functions.<br/>Non-nil arg PROCESS means do not return until some output has been received<br/>from PROCESS.<br/><br/>Non-nil second arg SECONDS and third arg MILLISEC are number of seconds<br/>and milliseconds to wait; return after that much time whether or not<br/>there is any subprocess output.  If SECONDS is a floating point number,<br/>it specifies a fractional number of seconds to wait.<br/>The MILLISEC argument is obsolete and should be avoided.<br/><br/>If optional fourth arg JUST-THIS-ONE is non-nil, only accept output<br/>from PROCESS, suspending reading output from other processes.<br/>If JUST-THIS-ONE is an integer, don't run any timers either.<br/>Return non-nil if we received any output before the timeout expired.
