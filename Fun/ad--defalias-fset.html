<strong>ad--defalias-fset</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ad--defalias-fset <u>FSETFUN</u> <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>NEWDEF</u>)</br>
</br>
Handle re/definition of an advised <u>FUNCTION</u> during de/activation.</br>
If <u>FUNCTION</u> does not have an original definition associated with it and</br>
the current definition is usable, then it will be stored as <u>FUNCTION</u>'s</br>
original definition.  If no current definition is available (even in the</br>
case of undefinition) nothing will be done.  In the case of redefinition</br>
the action taken depends on the value of `ad-redefinition-action' (which</br>
see).  Redefinition occurs when <u>FUNCTION</u> already has an original definition</br>
associated with it but got redefined with a new definition and then</br>
de/activated.  If you do not like the current redefinition action change</br>
the value of `ad-redefinition-action' and de/activate again.
