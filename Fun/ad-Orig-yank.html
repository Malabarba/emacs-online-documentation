<strong>ad-Orig-yank</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function.<br/>
<br/>
(ad-Orig-yank &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.<br/>
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the<br/>
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point<br/>
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.<br/>
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.<br/>
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.<br/>
<br/>
When this command inserts text into the buffer, it honors the<br/>
`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties'<br/>
variables, and the `yank-handler' text property.  See<br/>
`insert-for-yank-1' for details.<br/>
<br/>
See also the command `yank-pop' (M-y).
