<strong>ad-activate-internal</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="ad-activate.html">ad-activate</a></strong>' in `<code>advice.el</code>'.</br>

</br>
(ad-activate-internal <u>FUNCTION</u> &optional <u>COMPILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Activate all the advice information of an advised <u>FUNCTION</u>.</br>
If <u>FUNCTION</u> has a proper original definition then an advised</br>
definition will be generated from <u>FUNCTION</u>'s advice info and the</br>
definition of <u>FUNCTION</u> will be replaced with it.  If a previously</br>
cached advised definition was available, it will be used.</br>
The optional <u>COMPILE</u> argument determines whether the resulting function</br>
or a compilable cached definition will be compiled.  If it is negative</br>
no compilation will be performed, if it is positive or otherwise non-nil</br>
the resulting function will be compiled, if it is nil the behavior depends</br>
on the value of `ad-default-compilation-action' (which see).</br>
Activation of an advised function that has an advice info but no actual</br>
pieces of advice is equivalent to a call to `ad-unadvise'.  Activation of</br>
an advised function that has actual pieces of advice but none of them are</br>
enabled is equivalent to a call to `ad-deactivate'.  The current advised</br>
definition will always be cached for later usage.
