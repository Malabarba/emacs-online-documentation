<strong>ad-activate</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ad-activate FUNCTION &optional COMPILE)<br/>
<br/>
Activate all the advice information of an advised FUNCTION.<br/>
If FUNCTION has a proper original definition then an advised<br/>
definition will be generated from FUNCTION's advice info and the<br/>
definition of FUNCTION will be replaced with it.  If a previously<br/>
cached advised definition was available, it will be used.<br/>
The optional COMPILE argument determines whether the resulting function<br/>
or a compilable cached definition will be compiled.  If it is negative<br/>
no compilation will be performed, if it is positive or otherwise non-nil<br/>
the resulting function will be compiled, if it is nil the behavior depends<br/>
on the value of `ad-default-compilation-action' (which see).<br/>
Activation of an advised function that has an advice info but no actual<br/>
pieces of advice is equivalent to a call to `ad-unadvise'.  Activation of<br/>
an advised function that has actual pieces of advice but none of them are<br/>
enabled is equivalent to a call to `ad-deactivate'.  The current advised<br/>
definition will always be cached for later usage.
