<strong>ad-add-advice</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ad-add-advice FUNCTION ADVICE CLASS POSITION)<br/>
<br/>
Add a piece of ADVICE to FUNCTION's list of advices in CLASS.<br/>
<br/>
ADVICE has the form (NAME PROTECTED ENABLED DEFINITION), where<br/>
NAME is the advice name; PROTECTED is a flag specifying whether<br/>
to protect against non-local exits; ENABLED is a flag specifying<br/>
whether to initially enable the advice; and DEFINITION has the<br/>
form (advice . LAMBDA), where LAMBDA is a lambda expression.<br/>
<br/>
If FUNCTION already has a piece of advice with the same name,<br/>
then POSITION is ignored, and the old advice is overwritten with<br/>
the new one.<br/>
<br/>
If FUNCTION already has one or more pieces of advice of the<br/>
specified CLASS, then POSITION determines where the new piece<br/>
goes.  POSITION can either be `first', `last' or a number (where<br/>
0 corresponds to `first', and numbers outside the valid range are<br/>
mapped to the closest extremal position).<br/>
<br/>
If FUNCTION was not advised already, its advice info will be<br/>
initialized.  Redefining a piece of advice whose name is part of<br/>
the cache-id will clear the cache.<br/>
