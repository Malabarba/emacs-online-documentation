<strong>ad-add-advice</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ad-add-advice <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>ADVICE</u> <u>CLASS</u> <u>POSITION</u>)</br>
</br>
Add a piece of <u>ADVICE</u> to <u>FUNCTION</u>'s list of advices in <u>CLASS</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>ADVICE</u> has the form (NAME PROTECTED ENABLED DEFINITION), where</br>
NAME is the advice name; PROTECTED is a flag specifying whether</br>
to protect against non-local exits; ENABLED is a flag specifying</br>
whether to initially enable the advice; and DEFINITION has the</br>
form (advice . LAMBDA), where LAMBDA is a lambda expression.</br>
</br>
If <u>FUNCTION</u> already has a piece of advice with the same name,</br>
then <u>POSITION</u> is ignored, and the old advice is overwritten with</br>
the new one.</br>
</br>
If <u>FUNCTION</u> already has one or more pieces of advice of the</br>
specified <u>CLASS</u>, then <u>POSITION</u> determines where the new piece</br>
goes.  <u>POSITION</u> can either be `first', `last' or a number (where</br>
0 corresponds to `first', and numbers outside the valid range are</br>
mapped to the closest extremal position).</br>
</br>
If <u>FUNCTION</u> was not advised already, its advice info will be</br>
initialized.  Redefining a piece of advice whose name is part of</br>
the cache-id will clear the cache.
