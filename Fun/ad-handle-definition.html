<strong>ad-handle-definition</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ad-handle-definition FUNCTION)<br/>
<br/>
Handle re/definition of an advised FUNCTION during de/activation.<br/>
If FUNCTION does not have an original definition associated with it and<br/>
the current definition is usable, then it will be stored as FUNCTION's<br/>
original definition.  If no current definition is available (even in the<br/>
case of undefinition) nothing will be done.  In the case of redefinition<br/>
the action taken depends on the value of `ad-redefinition-action' (which<br/>
see).  Redefinition occurs when FUNCTION already has an original definition<br/>
associated with it but got redefined with a new definition and then<br/>
de/activated.  If you do not like the current redefinition action change<br/>
the value of `ad-redefinition-action' and de/activate again.
