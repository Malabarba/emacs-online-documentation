<strong>ad-recover-all</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ad-recover-all)</br>
</br>
Recover all currently advised functions.  Use in emergencies.</br>
To recover a function means to try to find its original (pre-advice)</br>
definition, and delete all advice.</br>
This is more low-level than `ad-unadvise' in that it does not do</br>
deactivation, which might run hooks and get into other trouble.
