</br>
</br>
(ad-recover-all)</br>
</br>
Recover all currently advised functions.  Use in emergencies.</br>
To recover a function means to try to find its original (pre-advice)</br>
definition, and delete all advice.</br>
This is more low-level than `ad-unadvise' in that it does not do</br>
deactivation, which might run hooks and get into other trouble.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
