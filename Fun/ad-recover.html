<strong>ad-recover</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ad-recover FUNCTION)<br/>
<br/>
Try to recover FUNCTION's original definition, and unadvise it.<br/>
This is more low-level than `ad-unadvise' in that it does not do<br/>
deactivation, which might run hooks and get into other trouble.<br/>
Use in emergencies.
