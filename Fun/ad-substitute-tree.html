<strong>ad-substitute-tree</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ad-substitute-tree SUBTREE-TEST FUNCTION TREE)<br/>
<br/>
Substitute qualifying subTREEs with result of FUNCTION(subTREE).<br/>
Only proper subtrees are considered, for example, if TREE is (1 (2 (3)) 4)<br/>
then the subtrees will be 1 (2 (3)) 2 (3) 3 4, dotted structures are<br/>
allowed too.  Once a qualifying subtree has been found its subtrees will<br/>
not be considered anymore.  (ad-substitute-tree 'atom 'identity tree)<br/>
generates a copy of TREE.
