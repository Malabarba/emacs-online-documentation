<strong>ad-substitute-tree</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>advice.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ad-substitute-tree <u>SUBTREE-TEST</u> <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>TREE</u>)</br>
</br>
Substitute qualifying subTREEs with result of <u>FUNCTION</u>(subTREE).</br>
Only proper subtrees are considered, for example, if <u>TREE</u> is (1 (2 (3)) 4)</br>
then the subtrees will be 1 (2 (3)) 2 (3) 3 4, dotted structures are</br>
allowed too.  Once a qualifying subtree has been found its subtrees will</br>
not be considered anymore.  (ad-substitute-tree 'atom 'identity tree)</br>
generates a copy of <u>TREE</u>.
