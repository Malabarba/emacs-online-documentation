<strong>ada-compile-goto-error</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ada-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ada-compile-goto-error <u>POS</u>)</br>
</br>
Replace `compile-goto-error' from compile.el.</br>
If <u>POS</u> is on a file and line location, go to this position.  It adds</br>
to compile.el the capacity to go to a reference in an error message.</br>
For instance, on these lines:</br>
  foo.adb:61:11:  [...] in call to size declared at foo.ads:11</br>
  foo.adb:61:11:  [...] in call to local declared at line 20</br>
the 4 file locations can be clicked on and jumped to.
