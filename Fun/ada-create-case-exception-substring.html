<strong>ada-create-case-exception-substring</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ada-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ada-create-case-exception-substring &optional <u>WORD</u>)</br>
</br>
Define the substring <u>WORD</u> as an exception for the casing system.</br>
If <u>WORD</u> is not given, then the current word in the buffer is used instead,</br>
or the selected region if any is active.</br>
The new word is added to the first file in `ada-case-exception-file'.</br>
When auto-casing a word, this substring will be special-cased, unless the</br>
word itself has a special casing.
