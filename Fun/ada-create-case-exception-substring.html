<strong>ada-create-case-exception-substring</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ada-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ada-create-case-exception-substring &optional WORD)<br/>
<br/>
Define the substring WORD as an exception for the casing system.<br/>
If WORD is not given, then the current word in the buffer is used instead,<br/>
or the selected region if any is active.<br/>
The new word is added to the first file in `ada-case-exception-file'.<br/>
When auto-casing a word, this substring will be special-cased, unless the<br/>
word itself has a special casing.
