ada-no-auto-case is a compiled Lisp function in `ada-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(ada-no-auto-case &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Do nothing.  ARG is ignored.<br/>This function can be used for the auto-casing variables in Ada mode, to<br/>adapt to unusual auto-casing schemes.  Since it does nothing, you can for<br/>instance use it for `ada-case-identifier' if you don't want any special<br/>auto-casing for identifiers, whereas keywords have to be lower-cased.<br/>See also `ada-auto-case' to disable auto casing altogether.
