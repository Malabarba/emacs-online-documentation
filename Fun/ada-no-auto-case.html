<strong>ada-no-auto-case</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ada-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ada-no-auto-case &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Do nothing.  ARG is ignored.<br/>
This function can be used for the auto-casing variables in Ada mode, to<br/>
adapt to unusual auto-casing schemes.  Since it does nothing, you can for<br/>
instance use it for `ada-case-identifier' if you don't want any special<br/>
auto-casing for identifiers, whereas keywords have to be lower-cased.<br/>
See also `ada-auto-case' to disable auto casing altogether.
