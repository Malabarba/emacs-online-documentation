<strong>add-hook</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(add-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional APPEND LOCAL)<br/>
<br/>
Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.<br/>
FUNCTION is not added if already present.<br/>
FUNCTION is added (if necessary) at the beginning of the hook list<br/>
unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case<br/>
FUNCTION is added at the end.<br/>
<br/>
The optional fourth argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify<br/>
the hook's buffer-local value rather than its global value.<br/>
This makes the hook buffer-local, and it makes t a member of the<br/>
buffer-local value.  That acts as a flag to run the hook<br/>
functions of the global value as well as in the local value.<br/>
<br/>
HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If<br/>
HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.  If HOOK's value is a single<br/>
function, it is changed to a list of functions.
