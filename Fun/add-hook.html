<strong>add-hook</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(add-hook <u>HOOK</u> <u>FUNCTION</u> &optional <u>APPEND</u> <u>LOCAL</u>)</br>
</br>
Add to the value of <u>HOOK</u> the function <u>FUNCTION</u>.</br>
<u>FUNCTION</u> is not added if already present.</br>
<u>FUNCTION</u> is added (if necessary) at the beginning of the hook list</br>
unless the optional argument <u>APPEND</u> is non-nil, in which case</br>
<u>FUNCTION</u> is added at the end.</br>
</br>
The optional fourth argument, <u>LOCAL</u>, if non-nil, says to modify</br>
the hook's buffer-local value rather than its global value.</br>
This makes the hook buffer-local, and it makes t a member of the</br>
buffer-local value.  That acts as a flag to run the hook</br>
functions of the global value as well as in the local value.</br>
</br>
<u>HOOK</u> should be a symbol, and <u>FUNCTION</u> may be any valid function.  If</br>
<u>HOOK</u> is void, it is first set to nil.  If <u>HOOK</u>'s value is a single</br>
function, it is changed to a list of functions.
