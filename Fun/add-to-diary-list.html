</br>
(add-to-diary-list <u>DATE</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>SPECIFIER</u> &optional <u>MARKER</u> <u>GLOBCOLOR</u> <u>LITERAL</u>)</br>

This function is obsolete since 23.1;</br>
use `diary-add-to-list' instead.</br>
</br>
Add an entry to `diary-entries-list'.</br>
Do nothing if <u>DATE</u> or <u>STRING</u> are nil.  <u>DATE</u> is the (MONTH DAY</br>
YEAR) for which the entry applies; <u>STRING</u> is the text of the</br>
entry as it will appear in the diary (i.e. with any format</br>
strings such as "%d" expanded); <u>SPECIFIER</u> is the date part of</br>
the entry as it appears in the diary-file; <u>LITERAL</u> is the entry</br>
as it appears in the diary-file (i.e. before expansion).</br>
If <u>LITERAL</u> is nil, it is taken to be the same as <u>STRING</u>.</br>
</br>
The entry is added to the list as (<u>DATE</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>SPECIFIER</u> LOCATOR</br>
<u>GLOBCOLOR</u>), where LOCATOR has the form (<u>MARKER</u> FILENAME <u>LITERAL</u>),</br>
FILENAME being the file containing the diary entry.</br>
</br>
Modifies <u>STRING</u> using `diary-modify-entry-list-string-function', if non-nil.</br>
Also removes the region between `diary-comment-start' and</br>
`diary-comment-end', if the former is non-nil.
