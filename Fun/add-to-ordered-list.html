add-to-ordered-list is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(add-to-ordered-list LIST-VAR ELEMENT &optional ORDER)<br/><br/>Add ELEMENT to the value of LIST-VAR if it isn't there yet.<br/>The test for presence of ELEMENT is done with `eq'.<br/><br/>The resulting list is reordered so that the elements are in the<br/>order given by each element's numeric list order.  Elements<br/>without a numeric list order are placed at the end of the list.<br/><br/>If the third optional argument ORDER is a number (integer or<br/>float), set the element's list order to the given value.  If<br/>ORDER is nil or omitted, do not change the numeric order of<br/>ELEMENT.  If ORDER has any other value, remove the numeric order<br/>of ELEMENT if it has one.<br/><br/>The list order for each element is stored in LIST-VAR's<br/>`list-order' property.<br/><br/>The return value is the new value of LIST-VAR.
