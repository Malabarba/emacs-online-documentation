<strong>align-areas</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(align-areas <u>AREAS</u> <u>PROPS</u> <u>RULE</u> <u>FUNC</u>)</br>
</br>
Given a list of <u>AREAS</u> and formatting <u>PROPS</u>, align according to <u>RULE</u>.</br>
<u>AREAS</u> should be a list of cons cells containing beginning and ending</br>
markers.  This function sweeps through all of the beginning markers,</br>
finds out which one starts in the furthermost column, and then deletes</br>
and inserts text such that all of the ending markers occur in the same</br>
column.</br>
</br>
If <u>FUNC</u> is non-nil, it will be called for each text region that would</br>
have been aligned.  No changes will be made to the buffer.
