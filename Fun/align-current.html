align-current is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `align.el'.<br/><br/>(align-current &optional RULES EXCLUDE-RULES)<br/><br/>Call `align' on the current alignment section.<br/>This function assumes you want to align only the current section, and<br/>so saves you from having to specify the region.  If RULES or<br/>EXCLUDE-RULES is set to a list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it<br/>can be used to override the default alignment rules that would have<br/>been used to align that section.
