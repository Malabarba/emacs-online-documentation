<strong>align-highlight-rule</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(align-highlight-rule <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> <u>TITLE</u> &optional <u>RULES</u> <u>EXCLUDE-RULES</u>)</br>
</br>
Highlight the whitespace which a given rule would have modified.</br>
<u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> mark the extent of the region.  <u>TITLE</u> identifies the rule</br>
that should be highlighted.  If <u>RULES</u> or <u>EXCLUDE-RULES</u> is set to a</br>
list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it can be used to override the</br>
default alignment rules that would have been used to identify the text</br>
to be colored.
