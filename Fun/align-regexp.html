<strong>align-regexp</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(align-regexp <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>GROUP</u> <u>SPACING</u> <u>REPEAT</u>)</br>
</br>
Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.</br>
<u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> mark the limits of the region.  Interactively, this function</br>
prompts for the regular expression <u>REGEXP</u> to align with.</br>
</br>
For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to</br>
align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:</br>
</br>
    Fred (123) 456-7890</br>
    Alice (123) 456-7890</br>
    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890</br>
    Joe (123) 456-7890</br>
</br>
There is no predefined rule to handle this, but you could easily do it</br>
using a <u>REGEXP</u> like "(".  Interactively, all you would have to do is</br>
to mark the region, call `align-regexp' and enter that regular expression.</br>
</br>
<u>REGEXP</u> must contain at least one parenthesized subexpression, typically</br>
whitespace of the form "\\(\\s-*\\)".  In normal interactive use,</br>
this is automatically added to the start of your regular expression after</br>
you enter it.  You only need to supply the characters to be lined up, and</br>
any preceding whitespace is replaced.</br>
</br>
If you specify a prefix argument (or use this function non-interactively),</br>
you must enter the full regular expression, including the subexpression.</br>
The function also then prompts for which subexpression parenthesis <u>GROUP</u></br>
(default 1) within <u>REGEXP</u> to modify, the amount of <u>SPACING</u> (default</br>
`align-default-spacing') to use, and whether or not to <u>REPEAT</u> the rule</br>
throughout the line.</br>
</br>
See `align-rules-list' for more information about these options.</br>
</br>
The non-interactive form of the previous example would look something like:</br>
  (align-regexp (point-min) (point-max) "\\(\\s-*\\)(")</br>
</br>
This function is a nothing more than a small wrapper that helps you</br>
construct a rule to pass to `align-region', which does the real work.
