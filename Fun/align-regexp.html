align-regexp is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `align.el'.<br/><br/>(align-regexp BEG END REGEXP &optional GROUP SPACING REPEAT)<br/><br/>Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.<br/>BEG and END mark the limits of the region.  This function will prompt<br/>for the REGEXP to align with.  If no prefix arg was specified, you<br/>only need to supply the characters to be lined up and any preceding<br/>whitespace is replaced.  If a prefix arg was specified, the full<br/>regexp with parenthesized whitespace should be supplied; it will also<br/>prompt for which parenthesis GROUP within REGEXP to modify, the amount<br/>of SPACING to use, and whether or not to REPEAT the rule throughout<br/>the line.  See `align-rules-list' for more information about these<br/>options.<br/><br/>For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to<br/>align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:<br/><br/>    Fred (123) 456-7890<br/>    Alice (123) 456-7890<br/>    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890<br/>    Joe (123) 456-7890<br/><br/>There is no predefined rule to handle this, but you could easily do it<br/>using a REGEXP like "(".  All you would have to do is to mark the<br/>region, call `align-regexp' and type in that regular expression.
