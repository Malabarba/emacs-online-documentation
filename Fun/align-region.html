<strong>align-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>align.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(align-region BEG END SEPARATE RULES EXCLUDE-RULES &optional FUNC)<br/>
<br/>
Align a region based on a given set of alignment rules.<br/>
BEG and END specify the region to be aligned.  Either may be nil, in<br/>
which case the range will stop at the nearest section division (see<br/>
`align-region-separate', and `align-region-heuristic' for more<br/>
information').<br/>
<br/>
The region will be divided into separate alignment sections based on<br/>
the value of SEPARATE.<br/>
<br/>
RULES and EXCLUDE-RULES are a pair of lists describing how to align<br/>
the region, and which text areas within it should be excluded from<br/>
alignment.  See the `align-rules-list' for more information on the<br/>
required format of these two lists.<br/>
<br/>
If FUNC is specified, no text will be modified.  What `align-region'<br/>
will do with the rules is to search for the alignment areas, as it<br/>
regularly would, taking account for exclusions, and then call FUNC,<br/>
first with the beginning and ending of the region to be aligned<br/>
according to that rule (this can be different for each rule, if BEG<br/>
and END were nil), and then with the beginning and ending of each<br/>
text region that the rule would have applied to.<br/>
<br/>
The signature of FUNC should thus be:<br/>
<br/>
 (defun my-align-function (beg end mode)<br/>
   "If MODE is a rule (a list), return t if BEG to END are to be searched.<br/>
Otherwise BEG to END will be a region of text that matches the rule's<br/>
definition, and MODE will be non-nil if any changes are necessary."<br/>
   (unless (and mode (listp mode))<br/>
     (message "Would have aligned from %d to %d..." beg end)))<br/>
<br/>
This feature (of passing a FUNC) is used internally to locate the<br/>
position of exclusion areas, but could also be used for any other<br/>
purpose where you might want to know where the regions that the<br/>
aligner would have dealt with are.
