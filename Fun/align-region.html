<strong>align-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(align-region <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> <u>SEPARATE</u> <u>RULES</u> <u>EXCLUDE-RULES</u> &optional <u>FUNC</u>)</br>
</br>
Align a region based on a given set of alignment rules.</br>
<u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> specify the region to be aligned.  Either may be nil, in</br>
which case the range will stop at the nearest section division (see</br>
`align-region-separate', and `align-region-heuristic' for more</br>
information').</br>
</br>
The region will be divided into separate alignment sections based on</br>
the value of <u>SEPARATE</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>RULES</u> and <u>EXCLUDE-RULES</u> are a pair of lists describing how to align</br>
the region, and which text areas within it should be excluded from</br>
alignment.  See the `align-rules-list' for more information on the</br>
required format of these two lists.</br>
</br>
If <u>FUNC</u> is specified, no text will be modified.  What `align-region'</br>
will do with the rules is to search for the alignment areas, as it</br>
regularly would, taking account for exclusions, and then call <u>FUNC</u>,</br>
first with the beginning and ending of the region to be aligned</br>
according to that rule (this can be different for each rule, if <u>BEG</u></br>
and <u>END</u> were nil), and then with the beginning and ending of each</br>
text region that the rule would have applied to.</br>
</br>
The signature of <u>FUNC</u> should thus be:</br>
</br>
 (defun my-align-function (beg end mode)</br>
   "If MODE is a rule (a list), return t if <u>BEG</u> to <u>END</u> are to be searched.</br>
Otherwise <u>BEG</u> to <u>END</u> will be a region of text that matches the rule's</br>
definition, and MODE will be non-nil if any changes are necessary."</br>
   (unless (and mode (listp mode))</br>
     (message "Would have aligned from %d to %d..." beg end)))</br>
</br>
This feature (of passing a <u>FUNC</u>) is used internally to locate the</br>
position of exclusion areas, but could also be used for any other</br>
purpose where you might want to know where the regions that the</br>
aligner would have dealt with are.
