<strong>align</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>align.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(align BEG END &optional SEPARATE RULES EXCLUDE-RULES)<br/>
<br/>
Attempt to align a region based on a set of alignment rules.<br/>
BEG and END mark the region.  If BEG and END are specifically set to<br/>
nil (this can only be done programmatically), the beginning and end of<br/>
the current alignment section will be calculated based on the location<br/>
of point, and the value of `align-region-separate' (or possibly each<br/>
rule's `separate' attribute).<br/>
<br/>
If SEPARATE is non-nil, it overrides the value of<br/>
`align-region-separate' for all rules, except those that have their<br/>
`separate' attribute set.<br/>
<br/>
RULES and EXCLUDE-RULES, if either is non-nil, will replace the<br/>
default rule lists defined in `align-rules-list' and<br/>
`align-exclude-rules-list'.  See `align-rules-list' for more details<br/>
on the format of these lists.
