all-completions is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(all-completions STRING COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE)<br/><br/>Search for partial matches to STRING in COLLECTION.<br/>Test each of the possible completions specified by COLLECTION<br/>to see if it begins with STRING.  The possible completions may be<br/>strings or symbols.  Symbols are converted to strings before testing,<br/>see `symbol-name'.<br/>The value is a list of all the possible completions that match STRING.<br/><br/>If COLLECTION is an alist, the keys (cars of elements) are the<br/>possible completions.  If an element is not a cons cell, then the<br/>element itself is the possible completion.<br/>If COLLECTION is a hash-table, all the keys that are strings or symbols<br/>are the possible completions.<br/>If COLLECTION is an obarray, the names of all symbols in the obarray<br/>are the possible completions.<br/><br/>COLLECTION can also be a function to do the completion itself.<br/>It receives three arguments: the values STRING, PREDICATE and t.<br/>Whatever it returns becomes the value of `all-completions'.<br/><br/>If optional third argument PREDICATE is non-nil,<br/>it is used to test each possible match.<br/>The match is a candidate only if PREDICATE returns non-nil.<br/>The argument given to PREDICATE is the alist element<br/>or the symbol from the obarray.  If COLLECTION is a hash-table,<br/>predicate is called with two arguments: the key and the value.<br/>Additionally to this predicate, `completion-regexp-list'<br/>is used to further constrain the set of candidates.<br/><br/>An obsolete optional fourth argument HIDE-SPACES is still accepted for<br/>backward compatibility.  If non-nil, strings in COLLECTION that start<br/>with a space are ignored unless STRING itself starts with a space.
