<strong>allout-aberrant-container-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(allout-aberrant-container-p)</br>
</br>
True if topic, or next sibling with children, contains them discontinuously.</br>
</br>
Discontinuous means an immediate offspring that is nested more</br>
than one level deeper than the topic.</br>
</br>
If topic has no offspring, then the next sibling with offspring will</br>
determine whether or not this one is determined to be aberrant.</br>
</br>
If true, then the allout-recent-* settings are calibrated on the</br>
offspring that qualifies it as aberrant, ie with depth that</br>
exceeds the topic by more than one.
