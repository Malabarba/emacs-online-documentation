<strong>allout-add-resumptions</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(allout-add-resumptions &rest <u>PAIRS</u>)</br>
</br>
Set name/value <u>PAIRS</u>.</br>
</br>
Old settings are preserved for later resumption using `allout-do-resumptions'.</br>
</br>
The new values are set as a buffer local.  On resumption, the prior buffer</br>
scope of the variable is restored along with its value.  If it was a void</br>
buffer-local value, then it is left as nil on resumption.</br>
</br>
The pairs are lists whose car is the name of the variable and car of the</br>
cdr is the new value: '(some-var some-value)'.  The pairs can actually be</br>
triples, where the third element qualifies the disposition of the setting,</br>
as described further below.</br>
</br>
If the optional third element is the symbol 'extend, then the new value</br>
created by `cons'ing the second element of the pair onto the front of the</br>
existing value.</br>
</br>
If the optional third element is the symbol 'append, then the new value is</br>
extended from the existing one by `append'ing a list containing the second</br>
element of the pair onto the end of the existing value.</br>
</br>
Extension, and resumptions in general, should not be used for hook</br>
functions -- use the 'local mode of `add-hook' for that, instead.</br>
</br>
The settings are stored on `allout-mode-prior-settings'.
