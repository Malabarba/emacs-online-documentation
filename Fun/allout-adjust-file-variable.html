<strong>allout-adjust-file-variable</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-adjust-file-variable VARNAME VALUE)<br/>
<br/>
Adjust the setting of an Emacs file variable named VARNAME to VALUE.<br/>
<br/>
This activity is inhibited if either `enable-local-variables' or<br/>
`allout-enable-file-variable-adjustment' are nil.<br/>
<br/>
When enabled, an entry for the variable is created if not already present,<br/>
or changed if established with a different value.  The section for the file<br/>
variables, itself, is created if not already present.  When created, the<br/>
section lines (including the section line) exist as second-level topics in<br/>
a top-level topic at the end of the file.<br/>
<br/>
`enable-local-variables' must be true for any of this to happen.
