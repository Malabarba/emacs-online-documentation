<strong>allout-adjust-file-variable</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(allout-adjust-file-variable <u>VARNAME</u> <u>VALUE</u>)</br>
</br>
Adjust the setting of an Emacs file variable named <u>VARNAME</u> to <u>VALUE</u>.</br>
</br>
This activity is inhibited if either `enable-local-variables' or</br>
`allout-enable-file-variable-adjustment' are nil.</br>
</br>
When enabled, an entry for the variable is created if not already present,</br>
or changed if established with a different value.  The section for the file</br>
variables, itself, is created if not already present.  When created, the</br>
section lines (including the section line) exist as second-level topics in</br>
a top-level topic at the end of the file.</br>
</br>
`enable-local-variables' must be true for any of this to happen.
