<strong>allout-after-saves-handler</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(allout-after-saves-handler)</br>
</br>
Decrypt topic encrypted for save, if it's currently being edited.</br>
</br>
Ie, if it was pending encryption and contained the point in its body before</br>
the save.</br>
</br>
We use values stored in `allout-after-save-decrypt' to locate the topic</br>
and the place for the cursor after the decryption is done.
