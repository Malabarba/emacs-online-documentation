allout-chart-subtree is a compiled Lisp function in `allout.el'.<br/><br/>(allout-chart-subtree &optional LEVELS VISIBLE ORIG-DEPTH PREV-DEPTH)<br/><br/>Produce a location "chart" of subtopics of the containing topic.<br/><br/>Optional argument LEVELS specifies a depth limit (relative to start<br/>depth) for the chart.  Null LEVELS means no limit.<br/><br/>When optional argument VISIBLE is non-nil, the chart includes<br/>only the visible subelements of the charted subjects.<br/><br/>The remaining optional args are for internal use by the function.<br/><br/>Point is left at the end of the subtree.<br/><br/>Charts are used to capture outline structure, so that outline-altering<br/>routines need to assess the structure only once, and then use the chart<br/>for their elaborate manipulations.<br/><br/>The chart entries for the topics are in reverse order, so the<br/>last topic is listed first.  The entry for each topic consists of<br/>an integer indicating the point at the beginning of the topic<br/>prefix.  Charts for offspring consist of a list containing,<br/>recursively, the charts for the respective subtopics.  The chart<br/>for a topics' offspring precedes the entry for the topic itself.<br/><br/>The other function parameters are for internal recursion, and should<br/>not be specified by external callers.  ORIG-DEPTH is depth of topic at<br/>starting point, and PREV-DEPTH is depth of prior topic.
