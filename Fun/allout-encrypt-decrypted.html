<br/>
(allout-encrypt-decrypted)<br/>
<br/>
Encrypt topics pending encryption except those containing exemption point.<br/>
<br/>
If a topic that is currently being edited was encrypted, we return a list<br/>
containing the location of the topic and the location of the cursor just<br/>
before the topic was encrypted.  This can be used, eg, to decrypt the topic<br/>
and exactly resituate the cursor if this is being done as part of a file<br/>
save.  See `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' for more info.
