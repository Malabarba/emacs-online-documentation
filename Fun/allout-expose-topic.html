<strong>allout-expose-topic</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-expose-topic SPEC)<br/>
<br/>
Apply exposure specs to successive outline topic items.<br/>
<br/>
Use the more convenient frontend, `allout-new-exposure', if you don't<br/>
need evaluation of the arguments, or even better, the `allout-layout'<br/>
variable-keyed mode-activation/auto-exposure feature of allout outline<br/>
mode.  See the respective documentation strings for more details.<br/>
<br/>
Cursor is left at start position.<br/>
<br/>
SPEC is either a number or a list.<br/>
<br/>
Successive specs on a list are applied to successive sibling topics.<br/>
<br/>
A simple spec (either a number, one of a few symbols, or the null<br/>
list) dictates the exposure for the corresponding topic.<br/>
<br/>
Non-null lists recursively designate exposure specs for respective<br/>
subtopics of the current topic.<br/>
<br/>
The `:' repeat spec is used to specify exposure for any number of<br/>
successive siblings, up to the trailing ones for which there are<br/>
explicit specs following the `:'.<br/>
<br/>
Simple (numeric and null-list) specs are interpreted as follows:<br/>
<br/>
 Numbers indicate the relative depth to open the corresponding topic.<br/>
     - negative numbers force the topic to be closed before opening to the<br/>
       absolute value of the number, so all siblings are open only to<br/>
       that level.<br/>
     - positive numbers open to the relative depth indicated by the<br/>
       number, but do not force already opened subtopics to be closed.<br/>
     - 0 means to close topic -- hide all offspring.<br/>
  :  - `repeat'<br/>
       apply prior element to all siblings at current level, *up to*<br/>
       those siblings that would be covered by specs following the `:'<br/>
       on the list.  Ie, apply to all topics at level but the last<br/>
       ones.  (Only first of multiple colons at same level is<br/>
       respected -- subsequent ones are discarded.)<br/>
  *  - completely opens the topic, including bodies.<br/>
  +  - shows all the sub headers, but not the bodies<br/>
  -  - exposes the body of the corresponding topic.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
(allout-expose-topic '(-1 : 0))<br/>
	Close this and all following topics at current level, exposing<br/>
	only their immediate children, but close down the last topic<br/>
	at this current level completely.<br/>
(allout-expose-topic '(-1 () : 1 0))<br/>
	Close current topic so only the immediate subtopics are shown;<br/>
	show the children in the second to last topic, and completely<br/>
	close the last one.<br/>
(allout-expose-topic '(-2 : -1 *))<br/>
        Expose children and grandchildren of all topics at current<br/>
	level except the last two; expose children of the second to<br/>
	last and completely open the last one.
