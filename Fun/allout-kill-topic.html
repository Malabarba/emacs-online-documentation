<strong>allout-kill-topic</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(allout-kill-topic)</br>
</br>
Kill topic together with subtopics.</br>
</br>
Trailing whitespace is killed with a topic if that whitespace:</br>
</br>
 - would separate the topic from a subsequent sibling</br>
 - would separate the topic from the end of buffer</br>
 - would not be added to whitespace already separating the topic from the</br>
   previous one.</br>
</br>
Topic exposure is marked with text-properties, to be used by</br>
`allout-yank-processing' for exposure recovery.
