<strong>allout-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle Allout outline mode.<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Allout outline mode if ARG is<br/>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br/>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Allout outline mode is a minor mode that provides extensive<br/>
outline oriented formatting and manipulation.  It enables<br/>
structural editing of outlines, as well as navigation and<br/>
exposure.  It also is specifically aimed at accommodating<br/>
syntax-sensitive text like programming languages.  (For example,<br/>
see the allout code itself, which is organized as an allout<br/>
outline.)<br/>
<br/>
In addition to typical outline navigation and exposure, allout includes:<br/>
<br/>
 - topic-oriented authoring, including keystroke-based topic creation,<br/>
   repositioning, promotion/demotion, cut, and paste<br/>
 - incremental search with dynamic exposure and reconcealment of hidden text<br/>
 - adjustable format, so programming code can be developed in outline-structure<br/>
 - easy topic encryption and decryption, symmetric or key-pair<br/>
 - "Hot-spot" operation, for single-keystroke maneuvering and exposure control<br/>
 - integral outline layout, for automatic initial exposure when visiting a file<br/>
 - independent extensibility, using comprehensive exposure and authoring hooks<br/>
<br/>
and many other features.<br/>
<br/>
Below is a description of the key bindings, and then description<br/>
of special `allout-mode' features and terminology.  See also the<br/>
outline menubar additions for quick reference to many of the<br/>
features.  Customize `allout-auto-activation' to prepare your<br/>
Emacs session for automatic activation of `allout-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
The bindings are those listed in `allout-prefixed-keybindings'<br/>
and `allout-unprefixed-keybindings'.  We recommend customizing<br/>
`allout-command-prefix' to use just `\C-c' as the command<br/>
prefix, if the allout bindings don't conflict with any personal<br/>
bindings you have on \C-c.  In any case, outline structure<br/>
navigation and authoring is simplified by positioning the cursor<br/>
on an item's bullet character, the "hot-spot" -- then you can<br/>
invoke allout commands with just the un-prefixed,<br/>
un-control-shifted command letters.  This is described further in<br/>
the HOT-SPOT Operation section.<br/>

<br/>
                  Topic Encryption<br/>
<br/>
Outline mode supports gpg encryption of topics, with support for<br/>
symmetric and key-pair modes, and auto-encryption of topics<br/>
pending encryption on save.<br/>
<br/>
Topics pending encryption are, by default, automatically<br/>
encrypted during file saves, including checkpoint saves, to avoid<br/>
exposing the plain text of encrypted topics in the file system.<br/>
If the content of the topic containing the cursor was encrypted<br/>
for a save, it is automatically decrypted for continued editing.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: A few GnuPG v2 versions improperly preserve incorrect<br/>
symmetric decryption keys, preventing entry of the correct key on<br/>
subsequent decryption attempts until the cache times-out.  That<br/>
can take several minutes.  (Decryption of other entries is not<br/>
affected.)  Upgrade your EasyPG version, if you can, and you can<br/>
deliberately clear your gpg-agent's cache by sending it a '-HUP'<br/>
signal.<br/>
<br/>
See `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption' function docstring<br/>
and `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' customization variable<br/>
for details.<br/>
<br/>
                 HOT-SPOT Operation<br/>
<br/>
Hot-spot operation provides a means for easy, single-keystroke outline<br/>
navigation and exposure control.<br/>
<br/>
When the text cursor is positioned directly on the bullet character of<br/>
a topic, regular characters (a to z) invoke the commands of the<br/>
corresponding allout-mode keymap control chars.  For example, "f"<br/>
would invoke the command typically bound to "C-c<space>C-f"<br/>
(C-c SPC C-f `allout-forward-current-level').<br/>
<br/>
Thus, by positioning the cursor on a topic bullet, you can<br/>
execute the outline navigation and manipulation commands with a<br/>
single keystroke.  Regular navigation keys (eg, C-f, C-n) don't get<br/>
this special translation, so you can use them to get out of the<br/>
hot-spot and back to normal editing operation.<br/>
<br/>
In allout-mode, the normal beginning-of-line command (C-a) is<br/>
replaced with one that makes it easy to get to the hot-spot.  If you<br/>
repeat it immediately it cycles (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles'<br/>
is set) to the beginning of the item and then, if you hit it again<br/>
immediately, to the hot-spot.  Similarly, `allout-beginning-of-current-entry'<br/>
(C-c SPC C-a) moves to the hot-spot when the cursor is already located<br/>
at the beginning of the current entry.<br/>
<br/>
                             Extending Allout<br/>
<br/>
Allout exposure and authoring activities all have associated<br/>
hooks, by which independent code can cooperate with allout<br/>
without changes to the allout core.  Here are key ones:<br/>
<br/>
`allout-mode-hook'<br/>
`allout-mode-deactivate-hook' (deprecated)<br/>
`allout-mode-off-hook'<br/>
`allout-exposure-change-functions'<br/>
`allout-structure-added-functions'<br/>
`allout-structure-deleted-functions'<br/>
`allout-structure-shifted-functions'<br/>
`allout-after-copy-or-kill-hook'<br/>
`allout-post-undo-hook'<br/>
<br/>
                            Terminology<br/>
<br/>
Topic hierarchy constituents -- TOPICS and SUBTOPICS:<br/>
<br/>
ITEM:   A unitary outline element, including the HEADER and ENTRY text.<br/>
TOPIC:  An ITEM and any ITEMs contained within it, ie having greater DEPTH<br/>
        and with no intervening items of lower DEPTH than the container.<br/>
CURRENT ITEM:<br/>
        The visible ITEM most immediately containing the cursor.<br/>
DEPTH:  The degree of nesting of an ITEM; it increases with containment.<br/>
        The DEPTH is determined by the HEADER PREFIX.  The DEPTH is also<br/>
        called the:<br/>
LEVEL:  The same as DEPTH.<br/>
<br/>
ANCESTORS:<br/>
        Those ITEMs whose TOPICs contain an ITEM.<br/>
PARENT: An ITEM's immediate ANCESTOR.  It has a DEPTH one less than that<br/>
        of the ITEM.<br/>
OFFSPRING:<br/>
        The ITEMs contained within an ITEM's TOPIC.<br/>
SUBTOPIC:<br/>
        An OFFSPRING of its ANCESTOR TOPICs.<br/>
CHILD:<br/>
        An immediate SUBTOPIC of its PARENT.<br/>
SIBLINGS:<br/>
        TOPICs having the same PARENT and DEPTH.<br/>
<br/>
Topic text constituents:<br/>
<br/>
HEADER: The first line of an ITEM, include the ITEM PREFIX and HEADER<br/>
        text.<br/>
ENTRY:  The text content of an ITEM, before any OFFSPRING, but including<br/>
        the HEADER text and distinct from the ITEM PREFIX.<br/>
BODY:   Same as ENTRY.<br/>
PREFIX: The leading text of an ITEM which distinguishes it from normal<br/>
        ENTRY text.  Allout recognizes the outline structure according<br/>
        to the strict PREFIX format.  It consists of a PREFIX-LEAD string,<br/>
        PREFIX-PADDING, and a BULLET.  The BULLET might be followed by a<br/>
        number, indicating the ordinal number of the topic among its<br/>
        siblings, or an asterisk indicating encryption, plus an optional<br/>
        space.  After that is the ITEM HEADER text, which is not part of<br/>
        the PREFIX.<br/>
<br/>
        The relative length of the PREFIX determines the nesting DEPTH<br/>
        of the ITEM.<br/>
PREFIX-LEAD:<br/>
        The string at the beginning of a HEADER PREFIX, by default a `.'.<br/>
        It can be customized by changing the setting of<br/>
        `allout-header-prefix' and then reinitializing `allout-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
        When the PREFIX-LEAD is set to the comment-string of a<br/>
        programming language, outline structuring can be embedded in<br/>
        program code without interfering with processing of the text<br/>
        (by Emacs or the language processor) as program code.  This<br/>
        setting happens automatically when allout mode is used in<br/>
        programming-mode buffers.  See `allout-use-mode-specific-leader'<br/>
        docstring for more detail.<br/>
PREFIX-PADDING:<br/>
        Spaces or asterisks which separate the PREFIX-LEAD and the<br/>
        bullet, determining the ITEM's DEPTH.<br/>
BULLET: A character at the end of the ITEM PREFIX, it must be one of<br/>
        the characters listed on `allout-plain-bullets-string' or<br/>
        `allout-distinctive-bullets-string'.  When creating a TOPIC,<br/>
        plain BULLETs are by default used, according to the DEPTH of the<br/>
        TOPIC.  Choice among the distinctive BULLETs is offered when you<br/>
        provide a universal argument (C-u) to the<br/>
        TOPIC creation command, or when explicitly rebulleting a TOPIC.  The<br/>
        significance of the various distinctive bullets is purely by<br/>
        convention.  See the documentation for the above bullet strings for<br/>
        more details.<br/>
EXPOSURE:<br/>
        The state of a TOPIC which determines the on-screen visibility<br/>
        of its OFFSPRING and contained ENTRY text.<br/>
CONCEALED:<br/>
        TOPICs and ENTRY text whose EXPOSURE is inhibited.  Concealed<br/>
        text is represented by "..." ellipses.<br/>
<br/>
        CONCEALED TOPICs are effectively collapsed within an ANCESTOR.<br/>
CLOSED: A TOPIC whose immediate OFFSPRING and body-text is CONCEALED.<br/>
OPEN:	A TOPIC that is not CLOSED, though its OFFSPRING or BODY may be.
