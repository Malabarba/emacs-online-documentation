allout-old-expose-topic is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `allout.el'.<br/><br/>(allout-old-expose-topic SPEC &rest FOLLOWERS)<br/><br/>Deprecated.  Use `allout-expose-topic' (with different schema<br/>format) instead.<br/><br/>Dictate wholesale exposure scheme for current topic, according to SPEC.<br/><br/>SPEC is either a number or a list.  Optional successive args<br/>dictate exposure for subsequent siblings of current topic.<br/><br/>A simple spec (either a number, a special symbol, or the null list)<br/>dictates the overall exposure for a topic.  Non null lists are<br/>composite specs whose first element dictates the overall exposure for<br/>a topic, with the subsequent elements in the list interpreted as specs<br/>that dictate the exposure for the successive offspring of the topic.<br/><br/>Simple (numeric and null-list) specs are interpreted as follows:<br/><br/> - Numbers indicate the relative depth to open the corresponding topic:<br/>  - negative numbers force the topic to be close before opening to the<br/>    absolute value of the number.<br/>  - positive numbers just open to the relative depth indicated by the number.<br/>  - 0 just closes<br/> - `*' completely opens the topic, including bodies.<br/> - `+' shows all the sub headers, but not the bodies<br/> - `-' exposes the body and immediate offspring of the corresponding topic.<br/><br/>If the spec is a list, the first element must be a number, which<br/>dictates the exposure depth of the topic as a whole.  Subsequent<br/>elements of the list are nested SPECs, dictating the specific exposure<br/>for the corresponding offspring of the topic.<br/><br/>Optional FOLLOWERS arguments dictate exposure for succeeding siblings.
