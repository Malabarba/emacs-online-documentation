<strong>allout-old-expose-topic</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(allout-old-expose-topic <u>SPEC</u> &rest <u>FOLLOWERS</u>)</br>
</br>
Deprecated.  Use `allout-expose-topic' (with different schema</br>
format) instead.</br>
</br>
Dictate wholesale exposure scheme for current topic, according to <u>SPEC</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>SPEC</u> is either a number or a list.  Optional successive args</br>
dictate exposure for subsequent siblings of current topic.</br>
</br>
A simple spec (either a number, a special symbol, or the null list)</br>
dictates the overall exposure for a topic.  Non null lists are</br>
composite specs whose first element dictates the overall exposure for</br>
a topic, with the subsequent elements in the list interpreted as specs</br>
that dictate the exposure for the successive offspring of the topic.</br>
</br>
Simple (numeric and null-list) specs are interpreted as follows:</br>
</br>
 - Numbers indicate the relative depth to open the corresponding topic:</br>
  - negative numbers force the topic to be close before opening to the</br>
    absolute value of the number.</br>
  - positive numbers just open to the relative depth indicated by the number.</br>
  - 0 just closes</br>
 - `*' completely opens the topic, including bodies.</br>
 - `+' shows all the sub headers, but not the bodies</br>
 - `-' exposes the body and immediate offspring of the corresponding topic.</br>
</br>
If the spec is a list, the first element must be a number, which</br>
dictates the exposure depth of the topic as a whole.  Subsequent</br>
elements of the list are nested <u>SPEC</u>s, dictating the specific exposure</br>
for the corresponding offspring of the topic.</br>
</br>
Optional <u>FOLLOWERS</u> arguments dictate exposure for succeeding siblings.
