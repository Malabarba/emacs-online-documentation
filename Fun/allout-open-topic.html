<strong>allout-open-topic</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(allout-open-topic <u>RELATIVE-DEPTH</u> &optional <u>BEFORE</u> <u>OFFER-RECENT-BULLET</u>)</br>
</br>
Open a new topic at depth DEPTH.</br>
</br>
New topic is situated after current one, unless optional flag <u>BEFORE</u></br>
is non-nil, or unless current line is completely empty -- lacking even</br>
whitespace -- in which case open is done on the current line.</br>
</br>
When adding an offspring, it will be added immediately after the parent if</br>
the other offspring are exposed, or after the last child if the offspring</br>
are hidden.  (The intervening offspring will be exposed in the latter</br>
case.)</br>
</br>
If <u>OFFER-RECENT-BULLET</u> is true, offer to use the bullet of the prior sibling.</br>
</br>
Nuances:</br>
</br>
- Creation of new topics is with respect to the visible topic</br>
  containing the cursor, regardless of intervening concealed ones.</br>
</br>
- New headers are generally created after/before the body of a</br>
  topic.  However, they are created right at cursor location if the</br>
  cursor is on a blank line, even if that breaks the current topic</br>
  body.  This is intentional, to provide a simple means for</br>
  deliberately dividing topic bodies.</br>
</br>
- Double spacing of topic lists is preserved.  Also, the first</br>
  level two topic is created double-spaced (and so would be</br>
  subsequent siblings, if that's left intact).  Otherwise,</br>
  single-spacing is used.</br>
</br>
- Creation of sibling or nested topics is with respect to the topic</br>
  you're starting from, even when creating backwards.  This way you</br>
  can easily create a sibling in front of the current topic without</br>
  having to go to its preceding sibling, and then open forward</br>
  from there.
