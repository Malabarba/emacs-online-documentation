<strong>allout-previous-single-char-property-change</strong> is an alias for `previous-single-char-property-change' in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-previous-single-char-property-change POSITION PROP &optional OBJECT LIMIT)<br/>
<br/>
Return the position of previous text property or overlay change for a specific property.<br/>
Scans characters backward from POSITION till it finds<br/>
a change in the PROP property, then returns the position of the change.<br/>
If the optional third argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means<br/>
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).<br/>
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.<br/>
<br/>
In a string, scan runs to the start of the string.<br/>
In a buffer, it runs to (point-min), and the value cannot be less than that.<br/>
<br/>
The property values are compared with `eq'.<br/>
If the property is constant all the way to the start of OBJECT, return the<br/>
first valid position in OBJECT.<br/>
If the optional fourth argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search back past<br/>
position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found before reaching LIMIT.
