<strong>allout-rebullet-topic-grunt</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-rebullet-topic-grunt &optional RELATIVE-DEPTH STARTING-DEPTH STARTING-POINT INDEX DO-SUCCESSORS SANS-OFFSPRING)<br/>
<br/>
Like `allout-rebullet-topic', but on nearest containing topic<br/>
(visible or not).<br/>
<br/>
See `allout-rebullet-heading' for rebulleting behavior.<br/>
<br/>
All arguments are optional.<br/>
<br/>
First arg RELATIVE-DEPTH means to shift the depth of the entire<br/>
topic that amount.<br/>
<br/>
Several subsequent args are for internal recursive use by the function<br/>
itself: STARTING-DEPTH, STARTING-POINT, and INDEX.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if optional SANS-OFFSPRING is non-nil then the offspring<br/>
are not shifted.  (Shifting a topic outwards without shifting<br/>
its offspring is disallowed, since this would create a<br/>
"containment discontinuity", where the depth difference between<br/>
a topic and its immediate offspring is greater than one.)
