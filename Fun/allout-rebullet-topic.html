<strong>allout-rebullet-topic</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(allout-rebullet-topic <u>ARG</u> &optional <u>SANS-OFFSPRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Rebullet the visible topic containing point and all contained subtopics.</br>
</br>
Descends into invisible as well as visible topics, however.</br>
</br>
When optional <u>SANS-OFFSPRING</u> is non-nil, subtopics are not</br>
shifted.  (Shifting a topic outwards without shifting its</br>
offspring is disallowed, since this would create a "containment</br>
discontinuity", where the depth difference between a topic and</br>
its immediate offspring is greater than one.)</br>
</br>
With repeat count, shift topic depth by that amount.
