<strong>allout-rebullet-topic</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-rebullet-topic ARG &optional SANS-OFFSPRING)<br/>
<br/>
Rebullet the visible topic containing point and all contained subtopics.<br/>
<br/>
Descends into invisible as well as visible topics, however.<br/>
<br/>
When optional SANS-OFFSPRING is non-nil, subtopics are not<br/>
shifted.  (Shifting a topic outwards without shifting its<br/>
offspring is disallowed, since this would create a "containment<br/>
discontinuity", where the depth difference between a topic and<br/>
its immediate offspring is greater than one.)<br/>
<br/>
With repeat count, shift topic depth by that amount.
