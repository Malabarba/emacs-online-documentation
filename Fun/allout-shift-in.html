</br>
(allout-shift-in <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Increase depth of current heading and any items collapsed within it.</br>
</br>
With a negative argument, the item is shifted out using</br>
`allout-shift-out', instead.</br>
</br>
With an argument greater than one, shift-in the item but not its</br>
offspring, making the item into a sibling of its former children,</br>
and a child of sibling that formerly preceded it.</br>
</br>
You are not allowed to shift the first offspring of a topic</br>
inwards, because that would yield a "containment</br>
discontinuity", where the depth difference between a topic and</br>
its immediate offspring is greater than one.  The first topic in</br>
the file can be adjusted to any positive depth, however.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
