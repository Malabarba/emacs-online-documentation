allout-shift-in is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `allout.el'.<br/><br/>(allout-shift-in ARG)<br/><br/>Increase depth of current heading and any items collapsed within it.<br/><br/>With a negative argument, the item is shifted out using<br/>`allout-shift-out', instead.<br/><br/>With an argument greater than one, shift-in the item but not its<br/>offspring, making the item into a sibling of its former children,<br/>and a child of sibling that formerly preceded it.<br/><br/>You are not allowed to shift the first offspring of a topic<br/>inwards, because that would yield a "containment<br/>discontinuity", where the depth difference between a topic and<br/>its immediate offspring is greater than one.  The first topic in<br/>the file can be adjusted to any positive depth, however.
