<strong>allout-shift-out</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-shift-out ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Decrease depth of current heading and any topics collapsed within it.<br/>
This will make the item a sibling of its former container.<br/>
<br/>
With a negative argument, the item is shifted in using<br/>
`allout-shift-in', instead.<br/>
<br/>
With an argument greater than one, shift-out the item's offspring<br/>
but not the item itself, making the former children siblings of<br/>
the item.<br/>
<br/>
With an argument greater than 1, the item's offspring are shifted<br/>
out without shifting the item.  This will make the immediate<br/>
subtopics into siblings of the item.
