<strong>allout-show-children</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-show-children &optional LEVEL STRICT)<br/>
<br/>
If point is visible, show all direct subheadings of this heading.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, do `allout-show-to-offshoot', and then show subheadings.<br/>
<br/>
Optional LEVEL specifies how many levels below the current level<br/>
should be shown, or all levels if t.  Default is 1.<br/>
<br/>
Optional STRICT means don't resort to -show-to-offshoot, no matter<br/>
what.  This is basically so -show-to-offshoot, which is called by<br/>
this function, can employ the pure offspring-revealing capabilities of<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Returns point at end of subtree that was opened, if any.  (May get a<br/>
point of non-opened subtree?)
