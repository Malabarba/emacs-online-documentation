<strong>allout-show-entry</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(allout-show-entry)</br>
</br>
Like `allout-show-current-entry', but reveals entries in hidden topics.</br>
</br>
This is a way to give restricted peek at a concealed locality without the</br>
expense of exposing its context, but can leave the outline with aberrant</br>
exposure.  `allout-show-offshoot' should be used after the peek to rectify</br>
the exposure.
