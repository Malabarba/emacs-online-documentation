<strong>allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption &optional <u>KEYMODE-CUE</u>)</br>
</br>
Encrypt clear or decrypt encoded topic text.</br>
</br>
Allout uses Emacs 'epg' library to perform encryption.  Symmetric</br>
and keypair encryption are supported.  All encryption is ascii</br>
armored.</br>
</br>
Entry encryption defaults to symmetric key mode unless keypair</br>
recipients are associated with the file (see</br>
`epa-file-encrypt-to') or the function is invoked with a</br>
(<u>KEYMODE-CUE</u>) universal argument greater than 1.</br>
</br>
When encrypting, <u>KEYMODE-CUE</u> universal argument greater than 1</br>
causes prompting for recipients for public-key keypair</br>
encryption.  Selecting no recipients results in symmetric key</br>
encryption.</br>
</br>
Further, encrypting with a <u>KEYMODE-CUE</u> universal argument greater</br>
than 4 - eg, preceded by a doubled Ctrl-U - causes association of</br>
the specified recipients with the file, replacing those currently</br>
associated with it.  This can be used to dissociate any</br>
recipients with the file, by selecting no recipients in the</br>
dialog.</br>
</br>
Encrypted topic's bullets are set to a `~' to signal that the</br>
contents of the topic (body and subtopics, but not heading) is</br>
pending encryption or encrypted.  `*' asterisk immediately after</br>
the bullet signals that the body is encrypted, its absence means</br>
the topic is meant to be encrypted but is not currently.  When a</br>
file with topics pending encryption is saved, topics pending</br>
encryption are encrypted.  See `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves'</br>
for auto-encryption specifics.</br>
</br>
*NOTE WELL* that automatic encryption that happens during saves will</br>
default to symmetric encryption -- you must deliberately (re)encrypt key-pair</br>
encrypted topics if you want them to continue to use the key-pair cipher.</br>
</br>
Level-one topics, with prefix consisting solely of an `*' asterisk, cannot be</br>
encrypted.  If you want to encrypt the contents of a top-level topic, use</br>
M-x allout-shift-in to increase its depth.
