<strong>allout-toggle-subtree-encryption</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-toggle-subtree-encryption &optional KEYMODE-CUE)<br/>
<br/>
Encrypt clear text or decrypt encoded topic contents (body and subtopics.)<br/>
<br/>
Entry encryption defaults to symmetric key mode unless keypair<br/>
recipients are associated with the file (see<br/>
`epa-file-encrypt-to') or the function is invoked with a<br/>
(KEYMODE-CUE) universal argument greater than 1.<br/>
<br/>
When encrypting, KEYMODE-CUE universal argument greater than 1<br/>
causes prompting for recipients for public-key keypair<br/>
encryption.  Selecting no recipients results in symmetric key<br/>
encryption.<br/>
<br/>
Further, encrypting with a KEYMODE-CUE universal argument greater<br/>
than 4 - eg, preceded by a doubled Ctrl-U - causes association of<br/>
the specified recipients with the file, replacing those currently<br/>
associated with it.  This can be used to dissociate any<br/>
recipients with the file, by selecting no recipients in the<br/>
dialog.<br/>
<br/>
Encryption and decryption uses the Emacs 'epg' library.<br/>
<br/>
Encrypted text will be ascii-armored.<br/>
