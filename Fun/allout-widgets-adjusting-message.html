</br>
(allout-widgets-adjusting-message <u>MESSAGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Post <u>MESSAGE</u> when pending are likely to make a big enough delay.</br>
</br>
If posting of the <u>MESSAGE</u> is warranted and there already is a</br>
`current-message' in the minibuffer, the <u>MESSAGE</u> is appended to</br>
the current one, and the previously pending `current-message' is</br>
returned for later posting on completion.</br>
</br>
If posting of the <u>MESSAGE</u> is warranted, but no `current-message'</br>
is pending, then t is returned to indicate that case.</br>
</br>
If posting of the <u>MESSAGE</u> is not warranted, then nil is returned.</br>
</br>
