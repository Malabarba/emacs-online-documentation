(allout-widgets-adjusting-message MESSAGE)<br/>
<br/>
Post MESSAGE when pending are likely to make a big enough delay.<br/>
<br/>
If posting of the MESSAGE is warranted and there already is a<br/>
`current-message' in the minibuffer, the MESSAGE is appended to<br/>
the current one, and the previously pending `current-message' is<br/>
returned for later posting on completion.<br/>
<br/>
If posting of the MESSAGE is warranted, but no `current-message'<br/>
is pending, then t is returned to indicate that case.<br/>
<br/>
If posting of the MESSAGE is not warranted, then nil is returned.<br/>
<br/>
See `allout-widgets-adjust-message-length-threshold',<br/>
`allout-widgets-adjust-message-size-threshold' for message<br/>
posting threshold criteria.
