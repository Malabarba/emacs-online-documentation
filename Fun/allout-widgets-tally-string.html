<strong>allout-widgets-tally-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>allout-widgets.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(allout-widgets-tally-string)<br/>
<br/>
Return a string giving the number of tracked widgets, or empty string if not tracking.<br/>
<br/>
The string is formed for appending to the allout-mode mode-line lighter.<br/>
<br/>
An empty string is also returned if tracking is inhibited or<br/>
widgets are locally inhibited.<br/>
<br/>
The number varies according to the evanescence of objects on a<br/>
 hash table with weak keys, so tracking of widget erasures is often delayed.
