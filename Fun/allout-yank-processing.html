allout-yank-processing is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `allout.el'.<br/><br/>(allout-yank-processing &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Incidental allout-specific business to be done just after text yanks.<br/><br/>Does depth adjustment of yanked topics, when:<br/><br/>1 the stuff being yanked starts with a valid outline header prefix, and<br/>2 it is being yanked at the end of a line which consists of only a valid<br/>     topic prefix.<br/><br/>Also, adjusts numbering of subsequent siblings when appropriate.<br/><br/>Depth adjustment alters the depth of all the topics being yanked<br/>the amount it takes to make the first topic have the depth of the<br/>header into which it's being yanked.<br/><br/>The point is left in front of yanked, adjusted topics, rather than<br/>at the end (and vice-versa with the mark).  Non-adjusted yanks,<br/>however, are left exactly like normal, non-allout-specific yanks.
