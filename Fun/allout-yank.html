</br>
</br>
(allout-yank &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
`allout-mode' yank, with depth and numbering adjustment of yanked topics.</br>
</br>
Non-topic yanks work no differently than normal yanks.</br>
</br>
If a topic is being yanked into a bare topic prefix, the depth of the</br>
yanked topic is adjusted to the depth of the topic prefix.</br>
</br>
  1 we're yanking in an `allout-mode' buffer</br>
  2 the stuff being yanked starts with a valid outline header prefix, and</br>
  3 it is being yanked at the end of a line which consists of only a valid</br>
    topic prefix.</br>
</br>
If these conditions hold then the depth of the yanked topics are all</br>
adjusted the amount it takes to make the first one at the depth of the</br>
header into which it's being yanked.</br>
</br>
The point is left in front of yanked, adjusted topics, rather than</br>
at the end (and vice-versa with the mark).  Non-adjusted yanks,</br>
however, (ones that don't qualify for adjustment) are handled</br>
exactly like normal yanks.</br>
</br>
Numbering of yanked topics, and the successive siblings at the depth</br>
into which they're being yanked, is adjusted.</br>
</br>
`allout-yank-pop' works with `allout-yank' just like normal `yank-pop'</br>
works with normal `yank' in non-outline buffers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
