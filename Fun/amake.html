<strong>amake</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>assoc.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(amake <u>ALIST-SYMBOL</u> <u>KEYLIST</u> &optional <u>VALUELIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Make an association list.</br>
The association list is attached to the alist referenced by</br>
<u>ALIST-SYMBOL</u>.  Each element in the <u>KEYLIST</u> becomes a key and is</br>
associated with the value in <u>VALUELIST</u> with the same index.  If</br>
<u>VALUELIST</u> is not supplied or is nil, then each key in <u>KEYLIST</u> is</br>
associated with nil.</br>
</br>
<u>KEYLIST</u> and <u>VALUELIST</u> should have the same number of elements, but</br>
this isn't enforced.  If <u>VALUELIST</u> is smaller than <u>KEYLIST</u>, remaining</br>
keys are associated with nil.  If <u>VALUELIST</u> is larger than <u>KEYLIST</u>,</br>
extra values are ignored.  Returns the created alist.
