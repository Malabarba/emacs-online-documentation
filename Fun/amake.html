<strong>amake</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>assoc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(amake ALIST-SYMBOL KEYLIST &optional VALUELIST)<br/>
<br/>
Make an association list.<br/>
The association list is attached to the alist referenced by<br/>
ALIST-SYMBOL.  Each element in the KEYLIST becomes a key and is<br/>
associated with the value in VALUELIST with the same index.  If<br/>
VALUELIST is not supplied or is nil, then each key in KEYLIST is<br/>
associated with nil.<br/>
<br/>
KEYLIST and VALUELIST should have the same number of elements, but<br/>
this isn't enforced.  If VALUELIST is smaller than KEYLIST, remaining<br/>
keys are associated with nil.  If VALUELIST is larger than KEYLIST,<br/>
extra values are ignored.  Returns the created alist.
