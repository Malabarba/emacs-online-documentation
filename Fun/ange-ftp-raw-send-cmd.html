<strong>ange-ftp-raw-send-cmd</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ange-ftp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ange-ftp-raw-send-cmd <u>PROC</u> <u>CMD</u> &optional <u>MSG</u> <u>CONT</u> <u>NOWAIT</u>)</br>
</br>
Low-level routine to send the given FTP <u>CMD</u> to the FTP process <u>PROC</u>.</br>
<u>MSG</u> is an optional message to output before and after the command.</br>
If <u>CONT</u> is non-nil then it is either a function or a list of function</br>
and some arguments.  The function will be called when the FTP command</br>
has completed.</br>
If <u>CONT</u> is nil then this routine will return (RESULT . LINE) where RESULT</br>
is whether the command was successful, and LINE is the line from the FTP</br>
process that caused the command to complete.</br>
If <u>NOWAIT</u> is given then the routine will return immediately the command has</br>
been queued with no result.  <u>CONT</u> will still be called, however.
