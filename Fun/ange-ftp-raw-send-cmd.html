<strong>ange-ftp-raw-send-cmd</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ange-ftp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ange-ftp-raw-send-cmd PROC CMD &optional MSG CONT NOWAIT)<br/>
<br/>
Low-level routine to send the given FTP CMD to the FTP process PROC.<br/>
MSG is an optional message to output before and after the command.<br/>
If CONT is non-nil then it is either a function or a list of function<br/>
and some arguments.  The function will be called when the FTP command<br/>
has completed.<br/>
If CONT is nil then this routine will return (RESULT . LINE) where RESULT<br/>
is whether the command was successful, and LINE is the line from the FTP<br/>
process that caused the command to complete.<br/>
If NOWAIT is given then the routine will return immediately the command has<br/>
been queued with no result.  CONT will still be called, however.
