(ange-ftp-re-read-dir &optional DIR)<br/>
<br/>
Reread remote directory DIR to update the directory cache.<br/>
The implementation of remote FTP file names caches directory contents<br/>
for speed.  Therefore, when new remote files are created, Emacs<br/>
may not know they exist.  You can use this command to reread a specific<br/>
directory, so that Emacs will know its current contents.
