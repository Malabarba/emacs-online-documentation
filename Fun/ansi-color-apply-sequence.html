<strong>ansi-color-apply-sequence</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ansi-color.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ansi-color-apply-sequence ESCAPE-SEQUENCE CODES)<br/>
<br/>
Apply ESCAPE-SEQ to CODES and return the new list of codes.<br/>
<br/>
ESCAPE-SEQ is an escape sequence parsed by `ansi-color-parse-sequence'.<br/>
<br/>
For each new code, the following happens: if it is 1-7, add it to<br/>
the list of codes; if it is 21-25 or 27, delete appropriate<br/>
parameters from the list of codes; if it is 30-37 resp. 39, the<br/>
foreground color code is replaced or added resp. deleted; if it<br/>
is 40-47 resp. 49, the background color code is replaced or added<br/>
resp. deleted; any other code is discarded together with the old<br/>
codes.	Finally, the so changed list of codes is returned.
