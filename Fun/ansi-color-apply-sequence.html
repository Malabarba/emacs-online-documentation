<strong>ansi-color-apply-sequence</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ansi-color.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ansi-color-apply-sequence <u>ESCAPE-SEQUENCE</u> <u>CODES</u>)</br>
</br>
Apply <u>ESCAPE-SEQUENCE</u> to <u>CODES</u> and return the new list of codes.</br>
</br>
<u>ESCAPE-SEQUENCE</u> is an escape sequence parsed by</br>
`ansi-color-parse-sequence'.</br>
</br>
For each new code, the following happens: if it is 1-7, add it to</br>
the list of codes; if it is 21-25 or 27, delete appropriate</br>
parameters from the list of codes; if it is 30-37 resp. 39, the</br>
foreground color code is replaced or added resp. deleted; if it</br>
is 40-47 resp. 49, the background color code is replaced or added</br>
resp. deleted; any other code is discarded together with the old</br>
codes.	Finally, the so changed list of codes is returned.
