<strong>antlr-indent-line</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>antlr-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(antlr-indent-line)</br>
</br>
Indent the current line as ANTLR grammar code.</br>
The indentation of grammar lines are calculated by `c-basic-offset',</br>
multiplied by:</br>
 - the level of the paren/brace/bracket depth,</br>
 - plus 0/2/1, depending on the position inside the rule: header, body,</br>
   exception part,</br>
 - minus 1 if `antlr-indent-item-regexp' matches the beginning of the</br>
   line starting from the first non-whitespace.</br>
</br>
Lines inside block comments are indented by `c-indent-line' according to</br>
`antlr-indent-comment'.</br>
</br>
Lines in actions except top-level actions in a header part or an option</br>
area are indented by `c-indent-line'.</br>
</br>
Lines in header actions are indented at column 0 if `antlr-language'</br>
equals to a key in `antlr-indent-at-bol-alist' and the line starting at</br>
the first non-whitespace is matched by the corresponding value.</br>
</br>
For the initialization of `c-basic-offset', see `antlr-indent-style' and,</br>
to a lesser extent, `antlr-tab-offset-alist'.
