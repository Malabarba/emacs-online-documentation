<strong>antlr-run-tool</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>antlr-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(antlr-run-tool COMMAND FILE &optional SAVED)<br/>
<br/>
Run Antlr took COMMAND on grammar FILE.<br/>
When called interactively, COMMAND is read from the minibuffer and<br/>
defaults to `antlr-tool-command' with a computed "-glib" option if<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Save all buffers first unless optional value SAVED is non-nil.  When<br/>
called interactively, the buffers are always saved, see also variable<br/>
`antlr-ask-about-save'.
