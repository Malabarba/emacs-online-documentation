<strong>antlr-show-makefile-rules</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>antlr-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(antlr-show-makefile-rules)</br>
</br>
Show Makefile rules for all grammar files in the current directory.</br>
If the `major-mode' of the current buffer has the value `makefile-mode',</br>
the rules are directory inserted at point.  Otherwise, a *Help* buffer</br>
is shown with the rules which are also put into the `kill-ring' for</br>
C-y.</br>
</br>
This command considers import/export vocabularies and grammar</br>
inheritance and provides a value for the "-glib" option if necessary.</br>
Customize variable `antlr-makefile-specification' for the appearance of</br>
the rules.</br>
</br>
If the file for a super-grammar cannot be determined, special file names</br>
are used according to variable `antlr-unknown-file-formats' and a</br>
commentary with value `antlr-help-unknown-file-text' is added.  The</br>
*Help* buffer always starts with the text in `antlr-help-rules-intro'.
