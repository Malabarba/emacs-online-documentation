append-to-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `files.el'.<br/><br/>(append-to-file START END FILENAME)<br/><br/>Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.<br/>When called from a function, expects three arguments,<br/>START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are normally buffer positions<br/>specifying the part of the buffer to write.<br/>If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents.<br/>If START is a string, then output that string to the file<br/>instead of any buffer contents; END is ignored.<br/><br/>This does character code conversion and applies annotations<br/>like `write-region' does.
