<strong>apropos-command</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>apropos.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-h a, <f1> a, <help> a, <menu-bar> <help-menu> <search-documentation> <find-commands-by-name>.<br/>
<br/>
(apropos-command PATTERN &optional DO-ALL VAR-PREDICATE)<br/>
<br/>
Show commands (interactively callable functions) that match PATTERN.<br/>
PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),<br/>
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,<br/>
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,<br/>
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.<br/>
<br/>
With C-u prefix, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also show<br/>
noninteractive functions.<br/>
<br/>
If VAR-PREDICATE is non-nil, show only variables, and only those that<br/>
satisfy the predicate VAR-PREDICATE.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a Lisp program, a string PATTERN is used as a regexp,<br/>
while a list of strings is used as a word list.
