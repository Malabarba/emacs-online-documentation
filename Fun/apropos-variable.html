PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),<br/>
or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,<br/>
search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,<br/>
search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.<br/>

normal variables.
