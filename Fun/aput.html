aput is a compiled Lisp function in `assoc.el'.<br/><br/>(aput ALIST-SYMBOL KEY &optional VALUE)<br/><br/>Insert a key-value pair into an alist.<br/>The alist is referenced by ALIST-SYMBOL.  The key-value pair is made<br/>from KEY and optionally, VALUE.  Returns the altered alist.<br/><br/>If the key-value pair referenced by KEY can be found in the alist, and<br/>VALUE is supplied non-nil, then the value of KEY will be set to VALUE.<br/>If VALUE is not supplied, or is nil, the key-value pair will not be<br/>modified, but will be moved to the head of the alist.  If the key-value<br/>pair cannot be found in the alist, it will be inserted into the head<br/>of the alist (with value nil if VALUE is nil or not supplied).
