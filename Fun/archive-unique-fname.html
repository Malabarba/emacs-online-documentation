<strong>archive-unique-fname</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>arc-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(archive-unique-fname FNAME DIR)<br/>
<br/>
Make sure a file FNAME can be created uniquely in directory DIR.<br/>
<br/>
If FNAME can be uniquely created in DIR, it is returned unaltered.<br/>
If FNAME is something our underlying filesystem can't grok, or if another<br/>
file by that name already exists in DIR, a unique new name is generated<br/>
using `make-temp-file', and the generated name is returned.
