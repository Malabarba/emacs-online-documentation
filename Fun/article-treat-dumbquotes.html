article-treat-dumbquotes is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `gnus-art.el'.<br/><br/>(article-treat-dumbquotes)<br/><br/>Translate M****s*** sm*rtq**t*s and other symbols into proper text.<br/>Note that this function guesses whether a character is a sm*rtq**t* or<br/>not, so it should only be used interactively.<br/><br/>Sm*rtq**t*s are M****s***'s unilateral extension to the<br/>iso-8859-1 character map in an attempt to provide more quoting<br/>characters.  If you see something like \222 or \264 where<br/>you're expecting some kind of apostrophe or quotation mark, then<br/>try this wash.
