(artist-draw-ellipse-general <u>X1</u> <u>Y1</u> <u>X-RADIUS</u> <u>Y-RADIUS</u>)</br>
</br>
Draw an ellipse with center at <u>X1</u>, <u>Y1</u> and <u>X-RADIUS</u> and <u>Y-RADIUS</u>.</br>
</br>
Output is an ellipse, which is a list (END-POINT-1 END-POINT-2 SHAPE-INFO).</br>
</br>
END-POINT-1 and END-POINT-2 are two-element vectors on the form [X Y].</br>
SHAPE-INFO is a two-element vector on the form [POINT-LIST FILL-INFO].</br>
</br>
POINT-LIST is a list of vectors on the form [X Y SAVED-CHAR NEW-CHAR].</br>
FILL-INFO is a list of vectors on the form [X Y ELLIPSE-WIDTH-ON-THIS-LINE].</br>
</br>
Ellipses with zero <u>Y-RADIUS</u> are not drawn correctly.
