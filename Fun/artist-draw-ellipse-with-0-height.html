<strong>artist-draw-ellipse-with-0-height</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>artist.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(artist-draw-ellipse-with-0-height X1 Y1 X-RADIUS Y-RADIUS)<br/>
<br/>
Draw an ellipse with center at X1, Y1 and X-RADIUS and Y-RADIUS.<br/>
<br/>
Output is an ellipse, which is a list (END-POINT-1 END-POINT-2 SHAPE-INFO).<br/>
<br/>
END-POINT-1 and END-POINT-2 are two-element vectors on the form [X Y].<br/>
SHAPE-INFO is a two-element vector on the form [POINT-LIST FILL-INFO].<br/>
<br/>
POINT-LIST is a list of vectors on the form [X Y SAVED-CHAR NEW-CHAR].<br/>
FILL-INFO is a list of vectors on the form [X Y ELLIPSE-WIDTH-ON-THIS-LINE].<br/>
<br/>
The Y-RADIUS must be 0, but the X-RADIUS must not be 0.
