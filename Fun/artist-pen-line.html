<strong>artist-pen-line</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>artist.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(artist-pen-line <u>X1</u> <u>Y1</u>)</br>
</br>
Draw a line from last pen position to <u>X1</u>, <u>Y1</u>.</br>
The character is replaced with the character in `artist-fill-char'.</br>
This will store all points in `artist-key-poly-point-list' in reversed</br>
order (I assume it is faster to cons to the beginning of the list than</br>
to append to the end of the list, when doing free-hand drawing).
