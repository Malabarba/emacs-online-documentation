artist-pen-line is a compiled Lisp function in `artist.el'.<br/><br/>(artist-pen-line X1 Y1)<br/><br/>Draw a line from last pen position to X1, Y1.<br/>The character is replaced with the character in `artist-fill-char'.<br/>This will store all points in `artist-key-poly-point-list' in reversed<br/>order (I assume it is faster to cons to the beginning of the list than<br/>to append to the end of the list, when doing free-hand drawing).
