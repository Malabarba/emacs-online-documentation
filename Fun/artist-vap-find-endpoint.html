<strong>artist-vap-find-endpoint</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>artist.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(artist-vap-find-endpoint X1 Y1 STEP-X STEP-Y ACCEPT-SET REJECT-SET)<br/>
<br/>
Find one endpoint for line through X1, Y1.<br/>
The endpoint is searched for in the direction defined by STEP-X, STEP-Y,<br/>
accepting characters in the list ACCEPT-SET, stopping immediately<br/>
when finding characters in the list REJECT-SET.  Fuzziness, that is<br/>
the number of consecutive characters not in ACCEPT-SET to allow as<br/>
part of the line, is determined by the variable `artist-vaporize-fuzziness'.<br/>
An endpoint is a cons pair, (ENDPOINT-X . ENDPOINT-Y).
