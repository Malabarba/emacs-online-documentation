<strong>ask-user-about-lock</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>userlock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ask-user-about-lock <u>FILE</u> <u>OPPONENT</u>)</br>
</br>
Ask user what to do when he wants to edit <u>FILE</u> but it is locked by <u>OPPONENT</u>.</br>
This function has a choice of three things to do:</br>
  do (signal 'file-locked (list <u>FILE</u> <u>OPPONENT</u>))</br>
    to refrain from editing the file</br>
  return t (grab the lock on the file)</br>
  return nil (edit the file even though it is locked).</br>
You can redefine this function to choose among those three alternatives</br>
in any way you like.
