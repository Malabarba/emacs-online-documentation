<strong>ask-user-about-lock</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>userlock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ask-user-about-lock FILE OPPONENT)<br/>
<br/>
Ask user what to do when he wants to edit FILE but it is locked by OPPONENT.<br/>
This function has a choice of three things to do:<br/>
  do (signal 'file-locked (list FILE OPPONENT))<br/>
    to refrain from editing the file<br/>
  return t (grab the lock on the file)<br/>
  return nil (edit the file even though it is locked).<br/>
You can redefine this function to choose among those three alternatives<br/>
in any way you like.
