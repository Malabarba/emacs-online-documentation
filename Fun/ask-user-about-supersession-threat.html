</br>
(ask-user-about-supersession-threat <u>FN</u>)</br>
</br>
Ask a user who is about to modify an obsolete buffer what to do.</br>
This function has two choices: it can return, in which case the modification</br>
of the buffer will proceed, or it can (signal 'file-supersession (file)),</br>

</br>
You can rewrite this to use any criterion you like to choose which one to do.</br>
The buffer in question is current when this function is called.
