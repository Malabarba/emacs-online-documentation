<strong>asm-comment</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>asm-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(asm-comment)</br>
</br>
Convert an empty comment to a `larger' kind, or start a new one.</br>
These are the known comment classes:</br>
</br>
   1 -- comment to the right of the code (at the comment-column)</br>
   2 -- comment on its own line, indented like code</br>
   3 -- comment on its own line, beginning at the left-most column.</br>
</br>
Suggested usage:  while writing your code, trigger asm-comment</br>
repeatedly until you are satisfied with the kind of comment.
