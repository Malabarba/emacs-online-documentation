<strong>asm-newline</strong> is an alias for `newline-and-indent' in `<code>asm-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(asm-newline)<br/>
<br/>
Insert a newline, then indent according to major mode.<br/>
Indentation is done using the value of `indent-line-function'.<br/>
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.<br/>
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this command indents to the<br/>
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.
