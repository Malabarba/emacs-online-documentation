<strong>assoc-ignore-case</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(assoc-ignore-case KEY ALIST)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>
use `assoc-string' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Like `assoc', but ignores differences in case and text representation.<br/>
KEY must be a string.  Upper-case and lower-case letters are treated as equal.<br/>
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.
