<strong>async-shell-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to M-&.</br>
</br>
<code>(async-shell-command <u>COMMAND</u> <em>&optional</em> <u>OUTPUT-BUFFER</u> <u>ERROR-BUFFER</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Execute string <u>COMMAND</u> asynchronously in background.</br>
</br>
Like `shell-command', but adds `&' at the end of <u>COMMAND</u></br>
to execute it asynchronously.</br>
</br>
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.</br>
That buffer is in shell mode.</br>
</br>
You can configure `async-shell-command-buffer' to specify what to do in</br>
case when `*Async Shell Command*' buffer is already taken by another</br>
running shell command.  To run <u>COMMAND</u> without displaying the output</br>
in a window you can configure `display-buffer-alist' to use the action</br>
`display-buffer-no-window' for the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.</br>
</br>
In Elisp, you will often be better served by calling `start-process'</br>
directly, since it offers more control and does not impose the use of a</br>
shell (with its need to quote arguments).
