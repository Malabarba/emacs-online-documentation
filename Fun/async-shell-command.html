<strong>async-shell-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to M-&.<br/>
<br/>
(async-shell-command COMMAND &optional OUTPUT-BUFFER ERROR-BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Execute string COMMAND asynchronously in background.<br/>
<br/>
Like `shell-command', but adds `&' at the end of COMMAND<br/>
to execute it asynchronously.<br/>
<br/>
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.<br/>
That buffer is in shell mode.<br/>
<br/>
In Elisp, you will often be better served by calling `start-process'<br/>
directly, since it offers more control and does not impose the use of a<br/>
shell (with its need to quote arguments).
