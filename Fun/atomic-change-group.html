<strong>atomic-change-group</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(atomic-change-group &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Perform BODY as an atomic change group.<br/>
This means that if BODY exits abnormally,<br/>
all of its changes to the current buffer are undone.<br/>
This works regardless of whether undo is enabled in the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanism is transparent to ordinary use of undo;<br/>
if undo is enabled in the buffer and BODY succeeds, the<br/>
user can undo the change normally.
