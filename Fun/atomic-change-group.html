<strong>atomic-change-group</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(atomic-change-group &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Perform <u>BODY</u> as an atomic change group.</br>
This means that if <u>BODY</u> exits abnormally,</br>
all of its changes to the current buffer are undone.</br>
This works regardless of whether undo is enabled in the buffer.</br>
</br>
This mechanism is transparent to ordinary use of undo;</br>
if undo is enabled in the buffer and <u>BODY</u> succeeds, the</br>
user can undo the change normally.
