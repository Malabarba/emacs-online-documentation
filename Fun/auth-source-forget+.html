<strong>auth-source-forget+</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>auth-source.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(auth-source-forget+ &rest <u>SPEC</u> &allow-other-keys)</br>
</br>
Forget any cached data matching <u>SPEC</u>.  Returns forgotten count.</br>
</br>
This is not a full `auth-source-search' spec but works similarly.</br>
For instance, (:host "myhost" "yourhost") would find all the</br>
cached data that was found with a search for those two hosts,</br>
while (:host t) would find all host entries.
