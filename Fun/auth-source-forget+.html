<strong>auth-source-forget+</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>auth-source.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(auth-source-forget+ &rest SPEC &allow-other-keys)<br/>
<br/>
Forget any cached data matching SPEC.  Returns forgotten count.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a full `auth-source-search' spec but works similarly.<br/>
For instance, (:host "myhost" "yourhost") would find all the<br/>
cached data that was found with a search for those two hosts,<br/>
while (:host t) would find all host entries.
