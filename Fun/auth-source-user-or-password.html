auth-source-user-or-password is a compiled Lisp function in `auth-source.el'.<br/><br/>(auth-source-user-or-password MODE HOST PORT &optional USERNAME CREATE-MISSING DELETE-EXISTING)<br/><br/>This function is obsolete since Emacs 24.1;<br/>use `auth-source-search' instead.<br/><br/>Find MODE (string or list of strings) matching HOST and PORT.<br/><br/>DEPRECATED in favor of `auth-source-search'!<br/><br/>USERNAME is optional and will be used as "login" in a search<br/>across the Secret Service API (see secrets.el) if the resulting<br/>items don't have a username.  This means that if you search for<br/>username "joe" and it matches an item but the item doesn't have<br/>a :user attribute, the username "joe" will be returned.<br/><br/>A non nil DELETE-EXISTING means deleting any matching password<br/>entry in the respective sources.  This is useful only when<br/>CREATE-MISSING is non nil as well; the intended use case is to<br/>remove wrong password entries.<br/><br/>If no matching entry is found, and CREATE-MISSING is non nil,<br/>the password will be retrieved interactively, and it will be<br/>stored in the password database which matches best (see<br/>`auth-sources').<br/><br/>MODE can be "login" or "password".
