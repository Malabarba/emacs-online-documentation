<strong>auto-compose-chars</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>composite.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(auto-compose-chars FUNC FROM TO FONT-OBJECT STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Compose the characters at FROM by FUNC.<br/>
FUNC is called with one argument GSTRING which is built for characters<br/>
in the region FROM (inclusive) and TO (exclusive).<br/>
<br/>
If the character are composed on a graphic display, FONT-OBJECT<br/>
is a font to use.  Otherwise, FONT-OBJECT is nil, and the function<br/>
`compose-gstring-for-terminal' is used instead of FUNC.<br/>
<br/>
If STRING is non-nil, it is a string, and FROM and TO are indices<br/>
into the string.  In that case, compose characters in the string.<br/>
<br/>
The value is a gstring containing information for shaping the characters.<br/>
<br/>
This function is the default value of `auto-composition-function' (which see).
