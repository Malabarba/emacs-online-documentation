<strong>auto-lower-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>frame.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(auto-lower-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle whether or not the selected frame should auto-lower.<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Lower mode if ARG is<br/>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br/>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/>
<br/>
Auto Lower mode does nothing under most window managers, which<br/>
switch focus on mouse clicks.  It only has an effect if your<br/>
window manager switches focus on mouse movement (in which case<br/>
you should also change `focus-follows-mouse' to t).  Then,<br/>
enabling Auto Lower Mode causes any graphical Emacs frame which<br/>
loses focus to be automatically lowered.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this minor mode controls Emacs's own auto-lower<br/>
feature.  Window managers that switch focus on mouse movement<br/>
often have their own features for raising or lowering frames.
