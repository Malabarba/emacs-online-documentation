<strong>auto-raise-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>frame.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(auto-raise-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle whether or not selected frames should auto-raise.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable Auto Raise mode if <u>ARG</u> is</br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable</br>
the mode if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.</br>
</br>
Auto Raise mode does nothing under most window managers, which</br>
switch focus on mouse clicks.  It only has an effect if your</br>
window manager switches focus on mouse movement (in which case</br>
you should also change `focus-follows-mouse' to t).  Then,</br>
enabling Auto Raise mode causes any graphical Emacs frame which</br>
acquires focus to be automatically raised.</br>
</br>
Note that this minor mode controls Emacs's own auto-raise</br>
feature.  Window managers that switch focus on mouse movement</br>
often have their own auto-raise feature.
