<strong>auto-raise-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>frame.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(auto-raise-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle whether or not selected frames should auto-raise.<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto Raise mode if ARG is<br/>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br/>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/>
<br/>
Auto Raise mode does nothing under most window managers, which<br/>
switch focus on mouse clicks.  It only has an effect if your<br/>
window manager switches focus on mouse movement (in which case<br/>
you should also change `focus-follows-mouse' to t).  Then,<br/>
enabling Auto Raise mode causes any graphical Emacs frame which<br/>
acquires focus to be automatically raised.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this minor mode controls Emacs's own auto-raise<br/>
feature.  Window managers that switch focus on mouse movement<br/>
often have their own auto-raise feature.
