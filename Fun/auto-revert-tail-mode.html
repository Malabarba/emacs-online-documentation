<strong>auto-revert-tail-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>autorevert.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(auto-revert-tail-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle reverting tail of buffer when the file grows.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable Auto-Revert Tail mode if <u>ARG</u></br>
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,</br>
enable the mode if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.</br>
</br>
When Auto Revert Tail mode is enabled, the tail of the file is</br>
constantly followed, as with the shell command `tail -f'.  This</br>
means that whenever the file grows on disk (presumably because</br>
some background process is appending to it from time to time),</br>
this is reflected in the current buffer.</br>
</br>
You can edit the buffer and turn this mode off and on again as</br>
you please.  But make sure the background process has stopped</br>
writing before you save the file!</br>
</br>
Use `auto-revert-mode' for changes other than appends!
