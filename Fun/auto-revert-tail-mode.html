auto-revert-tail-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `autorevert.el'.<br/><br/>(auto-revert-tail-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Toggle reverting tail of buffer when the file grows.<br/>With a prefix argument ARG, enable Auto-Revert Tail mode if ARG<br/>is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,<br/>enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/><br/>When Auto Revert Tail mode is enabled, the tail of the file is<br/>constantly followed, as with the shell command `tail -f'.  This<br/>means that whenever the file grows on disk (presumably because<br/>some background process is appending to it from time to time),<br/>this is reflected in the current buffer.<br/><br/>You can edit the buffer and turn this mode off and on again as<br/>you please.  But make sure the background process has stopped<br/>writing before you save the file!<br/><br/>Use `auto-revert-mode' for changes other than appends!
