<strong>avl-tree-stack</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>avl-tree.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(avl-tree-stack <u>TREE</u> &optional <u>REVERSE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return an object that behaves like a sorted stack</br>
of all elements of <u>TREE</u>.</br>
</br>
If <u>REVERSE</u> is non-nil, the stack is sorted in reverse order.</br>
(See also `avl-tree-stack-pop').</br>
</br>
Note that any modification to <u>TREE</u> *immediately* invalidates all</br>
avl-tree-stacks created before the modification (in particular,</br>
calling `avl-tree-stack-pop' will give unpredictable results).</br>
</br>
Operations on these objects are significantly more efficient than</br>
constructing a real stack with `avl-tree-flatten' and using</br>
standard stack functions.  As such, they can be useful in</br>
implementing efficient algorithms of AVL trees.  However, in cases</br>
where mapping functions `avl-tree-mapc', `avl-tree-mapcar' or</br>
`avl-tree-mapf' would be sufficient, it is better to use one of</br>
those instead.
