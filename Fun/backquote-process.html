(backquote-process S &optional LEVEL)<br/>
<br/>
Process the body of a backquote.<br/>
S is the body.  Returns a cons cell whose cdr is piece of code which<br/>
is the macro-expansion of S, and whose car is a small integer whose value<br/>
can either indicate that the code is constant (0), or not (1), or returns<br/>
a list which should be spliced into its environment (2).<br/>
LEVEL is only used internally and indicates the nesting level:<br/>
0 (the default) is for the toplevel nested inside a single backquote.
