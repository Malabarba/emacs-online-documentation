<strong>backquote-process</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>backquote.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(backquote-process <u>S</u> &optional <u>LEVEL</u>)</br>
</br>
Process the body of a backquote.</br>
<u>S</u> is the body.  Returns a cons cell whose cdr is piece of code which</br>
is the macro-expansion of <u>S</u>, and whose car is a small integer whose value</br>
can either indicate that the code is constant (0), or not (1), or returns</br>
a list which should be spliced into its environment (2).</br>
<u>LEVEL</u> is only used internally and indicates the nesting level:</br>
0 (the default) is for the toplevel nested inside a single backquote.
