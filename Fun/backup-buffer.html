<strong>backup-buffer</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(backup-buffer)</br>
</br>
Make a backup of the disk file visited by the current buffer, if appropriate.</br>
This is normally done before saving the buffer the first time.</br>
</br>
A backup may be done by renaming or by copying; see documentation of</br>
variable `make-backup-files'.  If it's done by renaming, then the file is</br>
no longer accessible under its old name.</br>
</br>
The value is non-nil after a backup was made by renaming.</br>
It has the form (MODES EXTENDED-ATTRIBUTES BACKUPNAME).</br>
MODES is the result of `file-modes' on the original</br>
file; this means that the caller, after saving the buffer, should change</br>
the modes of the new file to agree with the old modes.</br>
EXTENDED-ATTRIBUTES is the result of `file-extended-attributes'</br>
on the original file; this means that the caller, after saving</br>
the buffer, should change the extended attributes of the new file</br>
to agree with the old attributes.</br>
BACKUPNAME is the backup file name, which is the old file renamed.
