<br/>
It is bound to DEL.<br/>
<br/>
(backward-delete-char-untabify ARG &optional KILLP)<br/>
<br/>
Delete characters backward, changing tabs into spaces.<br/>
The exact behavior depends on `backward-delete-char-untabify-method'.<br/>
Delete ARG chars, and kill (save in kill ring) if KILLP is non-nil.<br/>
Interactively, ARG is the prefix arg (default 1)<br/>
and KILLP is t if a prefix arg was specified.
