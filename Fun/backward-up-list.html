<strong>backward-up-list</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>lisp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;C-M-up>, C-M-u, ESC &lt;C-up>.</br>
</br>
<code>(backward-up-list <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u> <u>ESCAPE-STRINGS</u> <u>NO-SYNTAX-CROSSING</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Move backward out of one level of parentheses.</br>
This command will also work on other parentheses-like expressions</br>
defined by the current language mode.  With <u>ARG</u>, do this that</br>
many times.  A negative argument means move forward but still to</br>
a less deep spot.  If <u>ESCAPE-STRINGS</u> is non-nil (as it is</br>
interactively), move out of enclosing strings as well.  If</br>
<u>NO-SYNTAX-CROSSING</u> is non-nil (as it is interactively), prefer to</br>
break out of any enclosing string instead of moving to the start</br>
of a list broken across multiple strings.  On error, location of</br>
point is unspecified.
