<strong>batch-byte-compile-if-not-done</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(batch-byte-compile-if-not-done)<br/>
<br/>
Like `byte-compile-file' but doesn't recompile if already up to date.<br/>
Use this from the command line, with `-batch';<br/>
it won't work in an interactive Emacs.
