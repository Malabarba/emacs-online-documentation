<strong>batch-byte-compile</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(batch-byte-compile &optional NOFORCE)<br/>
<br/>
Run `byte-compile-file' on the files remaining on the command line.<br/>
Use this from the command line, with `-batch';<br/>
it won't work in an interactive Emacs.<br/>
Each file is processed even if an error occurred previously.<br/>
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile $emacs/ ~/*.el".<br/>
If NOFORCE is non-nil, don't recompile a file that seems to be<br/>
already up-to-date.
