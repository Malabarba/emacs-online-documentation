<strong>beginning-of-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <begin>, <C-home>, M-<, <menu-bar> <edit> <goto> <beg-of-buf>.<br/>
<br/>
(beginning-of-buffer &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Move point to the beginning of the buffer.<br/>
With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.<br/>
If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning of the<br/>
accessible part of the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous<br/>
position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.<br/>
<br/>
Don't use this command in Lisp programs!<br/>
(goto-char (point-min)) is faster.
