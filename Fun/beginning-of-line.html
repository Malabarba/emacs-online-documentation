beginning-of-line is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(beginning-of-line &optional N)<br/><br/>Move point to beginning of current line (in the logical order).<br/>With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.<br/>If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.<br/><br/>This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves<br/>point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.<br/>If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field starts at point, the point<br/>does not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind<br/>`inhibit-field-text-motion' to t, or use the `forward-line' function<br/>instead.  For instance, `(forward-line 0)' does the same thing as<br/>`(beginning-of-line)', except that it ignores field boundaries.
