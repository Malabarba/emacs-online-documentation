<strong>benchmark-run-compiled</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>benchmark.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(benchmark-run-compiled &optional <u>REPETITIONS</u> &rest <u>FORMS</u>)</br>
</br>
Time execution of compiled version of <u>FORMS</u>.</br>
This is like `benchmark-run', but what is timed is a funcall of the</br>
byte code obtained by wrapping <u>FORMS</u> in a `lambda' and compiling the</br>
result.  The overhead of the `lambda's is accounted for.
