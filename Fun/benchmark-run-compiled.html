<strong>benchmark-run-compiled</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>benchmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(benchmark-run-compiled &optional REPETITIONS &rest FORMS)<br/>
<br/>
Time execution of compiled version of FORMS.<br/>
This is like `benchmark-run', but what is timed is a funcall of the<br/>
byte code obtained by wrapping FORMS in a `lambda' and compiling the<br/>
result.  The overhead of the `lambda's is accounted for.
