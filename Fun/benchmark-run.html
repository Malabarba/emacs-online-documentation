<strong>benchmark-run</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>benchmark.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(benchmark-run &optional <u>REPETITIONS</u> &rest <u>FORMS</u>)</br>
</br>

If <u>REPETITIONS</u> is supplied as a number, run forms that many times,</br>
accounting for the overhead of the resulting loop.  Otherwise run</br>
<u>FORMS</u> once.</br>

garbage collections that ran, and the time taken by garbage collection.</br>
