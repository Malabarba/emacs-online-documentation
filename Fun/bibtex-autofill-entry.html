<strong>bibtex-autofill-entry</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>bibtex.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(bibtex-autofill-entry)</br>
</br>
Try to fill fields of current BibTeX entry based on neighboring entries.</br>
The current entry must have a key.  Determine the neighboring entry</br>
(previous or next) whose key is more similar to the key of the current</br>
entry.  For all empty fields of the current entry insert the corresponding</br>
field contents of the neighboring entry.  Finally try to update the text</br>
based on the difference between the keys of the neighboring and the current</br>
entry (for example, the year parts of the keys).
