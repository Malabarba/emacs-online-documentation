bibtex-clean-entry is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `bibtex.el'.<br/><br/>(bibtex-clean-entry &optional NEW-KEY CALLED-BY-REFORMAT)<br/><br/>Finish editing the current BibTeX entry and clean it up.<br/>Check that no required fields are empty and format entry dependent<br/>on the value of `bibtex-entry-format'.<br/>If the reference key of the entry is empty or a prefix argument is given,<br/>calculate a new reference key.  (Note: this works only if fields in entry<br/>begin on separate lines prior to calling `bibtex-clean-entry' or if<br/>'realign is contained in `bibtex-entry-format'.)<br/>Don't call `bibtex-clean-entry' on @Preamble entries.<br/>At end of the cleaning process, the functions in<br/>`bibtex-clean-entry-hook' are called with region narrowed to entry.
