bibtex-enclosing-field is a compiled Lisp function in `bibtex.el'.<br/><br/>(bibtex-enclosing-field &optional COMMA NOERR)<br/><br/>Search for BibTeX field enclosing point.<br/>For `bibtex-mode''s internal algorithms, a field begins at the comma<br/>following the preceding field.  Usually, this is not what the user expects.<br/>Thus if COMMA is non-nil, the "current field" includes the terminating comma<br/>as well as the entry delimiter if it appears on the same line.<br/>Unless NOERR is non-nil, signal an error if no enclosing field is found.<br/>On success return bounds, nil otherwise.  Do not move point.
