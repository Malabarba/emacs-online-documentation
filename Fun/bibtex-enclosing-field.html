<strong>bibtex-enclosing-field</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>bibtex.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(bibtex-enclosing-field &optional <u>COMMA</u> <u>NOERR</u>)</br>
</br>
Search for BibTeX field enclosing point.</br>
For `bibtex-mode''s internal algorithms, a field begins at the comma</br>
following the preceding field.  Usually, this is not what the user expects.</br>
Thus if <u>COMMA</u> is non-nil, the "current field" includes the terminating comma</br>
as well as the entry delimiter if it appears on the same line.</br>
Unless <u>NOERR</u> is non-nil, signal an error if no enclosing field is found.</br>
On success return bounds, nil otherwise.  Do not move point.
