<strong>bibtex-make-field</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>bibtex.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(bibtex-make-field FIELD &optional MOVE INTERACTIVE NODELIM)<br/>
<br/>
Make a field named FIELD in current BibTeX entry.<br/>
FIELD is either a string or a list of the form<br/>
(FIELD-NAME COMMENT-STRING INIT ALTERNATIVE-FLAG) as in<br/>
`bibtex-BibTeX-entry-alist' and friends.<br/>
If MOVE is non-nil, move point past the present field before making<br/>
the new field.  If INTERACTIVE is non-nil, move point to the end of<br/>
the new field.  Otherwise move point past the new field.<br/>
MOVE and INTERACTIVE are t when called interactively.<br/>
INIT is surrounded by field delimiters, unless NODELIM is non-nil.
