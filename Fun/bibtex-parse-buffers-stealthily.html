</br>
(bibtex-parse-buffers-stealthily)</br>
</br>
Parse buffer in the background during idle time.</br>
Called by `run-with-idle-timer'.  Whenever Emacs has been idle</br>
for `bibtex-parse-keys-timeout' seconds, parse all BibTeX buffers</br>
which have been modified after last parsing.</br>
Parsing initializes `bibtex-reference-keys' and `bibtex-strings'.
