bibtex-set-dialect is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `bibtex.el'.<br/><br/>(bibtex-set-dialect &optional DIALECT LOCAL)<br/><br/>Select BibTeX DIALECT for editing BibTeX files.<br/>This sets the user variable `bibtex-dialect' as well as the dialect-dependent<br/>internal variables.  Allowed dialects are listed in `bibtex-dialect-list'.<br/>If DIALECT is nil use current value of `bibtex-dialect'.<br/>If LOCAL is non-nil make buffer-local bindings for these variables rather than<br/>setting the global values.  The dialect-dependent internal variables<br/>are also bound buffer-locally if `bibtex-dialect' is already buffer-local<br/>in the current buffer (for example, as a file-local variable).<br/>LOCAL is t for interactive calls.
