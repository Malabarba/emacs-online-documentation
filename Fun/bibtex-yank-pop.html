<strong>bibtex-yank-pop</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>bibtex.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(bibtex-yank-pop <u>N</u>)</br>
</br>
Replace just-yanked killed BibTeX item with a different item.</br>
This command is allowed only immediately after a `bibtex-yank' or a</br>
`bibtex-yank-pop'.  In this case, the region contains a reinserted</br>
previously killed BibTeX item.  `bibtex-yank-pop' deletes that item</br>
and inserts in its place a different killed BibTeX item.</br>
</br>
With no argument, the previous kill is inserted.</br>
With argument <u>N</u>, insert the <u>N</u>th previous kill.</br>
If <u>N</u> is negative, this is a more recent kill.</br>
</br>
The sequence of kills wraps around, so that after the oldest one</br>
comes the newest one.
