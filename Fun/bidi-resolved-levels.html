<strong>bidi-resolved-levels</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(bidi-resolved-levels &optional <u>VPOS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the resolved bidirectional levels of characters at <u>VPOS</u>.</br>
</br>
The resolved levels are produced by the Emacs bidi reordering engine</br>
that implements the UBA, the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.  Please</br>
read the Unicode Standard Annex 9 (UAX#9) for background information</br>
about these levels.</br>
</br>
<u>VPOS</u> is the zero-based number of the current window's screen line</br>
for which to produce the resolved levels.  If <u>VPOS</u> is nil or omitted,</br>
it defaults to the screen line of point.  If the window displays a</br>
header line, <u>VPOS</u> of zero will report on the header line, and first</br>
line of text in the window will have <u>VPOS</u> of 1.</br>
</br>
Value is an array of resolved levels, indexed by glyph number.</br>
Glyphs are numbered from zero starting from the beginning of the</br>
screen line, i.e. the left edge of the window for left-to-right lines</br>
and from the right edge for right-to-left lines.  The resolved levels</br>
are produced only for the window's text area; text in display margins</br>
is not included.</br>
</br>
If the selected window's display is not up-to-date, or if the specified</br>
screen line does not display text, this function returns nil.  It is</br>
highly recommended to bind this function to some simple key, like F8,</br>
in order to avoid these problems.</br>
</br>
This function exists mainly for testing the correctness of the</br>
Emacs UBA implementation, in particular with the test suite.
