binary-overwrite-mode is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>(binary-overwrite-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Toggle Binary Overwrite mode.<br/>With a prefix argument ARG, enable Binary Overwrite mode if ARG<br/>is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,<br/>enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/><br/>When Binary Overwrite mode is enabled, printing characters typed<br/>in replace existing text.  Newlines are not treated specially, so<br/>typing at the end of a line joins the line to the next, with the<br/>typed character between them.  Typing before a tab character<br/>simply replaces the tab with the character typed.<br/>C-q replaces the text at the cursor, just as<br/>ordinary typing characters do.<br/><br/>Note that Binary Overwrite mode is not its own minor mode; it is<br/>a specialization of overwrite mode, entered by setting the<br/>`overwrite-mode' variable to `overwrite-mode-binary'.
