<strong>block</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="cl-block.html">cl-block</a></strong>' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(block <u>NAME</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Define a lexically-scoped block named <u>NAME</u>.</br>
<u>NAME</u> may be any symbol.  Code inside the <u>BODY</u> forms can call `cl-return-from'</br>
to jump prematurely out of the block.  This differs from `catch' and `throw'</br>
in two respects:  First, the <u>NAME</u> is an unevaluated symbol rather than a</br>
quoted symbol or other form; and second, <u>NAME</u> is lexically rather than</br>
dynamically scoped:  Only references to it within <u>BODY</u> will work.  These</br>
references may appear inside macro expansions, but not inside functions</br>
called from <u>BODY</u>.
