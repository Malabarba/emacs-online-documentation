bookmark-delete is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `bookmark.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <menu-bar> <edit> <bookmark> <delete>.<br/><br/>(bookmark-delete BOOKMARK-NAME &optional BATCH)<br/><br/>Delete BOOKMARK-NAME from the bookmark list.<br/><br/>Removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name.  If<br/>there are one or more other bookmarks with the same name, they will<br/>not be deleted.  Defaults to the "current" bookmark (that is, the<br/>one most recently used in this file, if any).<br/>Optional second arg BATCH means don't update the bookmark list buffer,<br/>probably because we were called from there.
