<strong>bookmark-delete</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;menu-bar> &lt;edit> &lt;bookmark> &lt;delete>.</br>
</br>
<code>(bookmark-delete <u>BOOKMARK-NAME</u> <em>&optional</em> <u>BATCH</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Delete <u>BOOKMARK-NAME</u> from the bookmark list.</br>
</br>
Removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name.  If</br>
there are one or more other bookmarks with the same name, they will</br>
not be deleted.  Defaults to the "current" bookmark (that is, the</br>
one most recently used in this file, if any).</br>
Optional second arg <u>BATCH</u> means don't update the bookmark list buffer,</br>
probably because we were called from there.
