<strong>bookmark-insert</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <edit> <bookmark> <insert>.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-insert BOOKMARK-NAME)<br/>
<br/>
Insert the text of the file pointed to by bookmark BOOKMARK-NAME.<br/>
BOOKMARK-NAME is a bookmark name (a string), not a bookmark record.<br/>
<br/>
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable<br/>
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some<br/>
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about<br/>
this.
