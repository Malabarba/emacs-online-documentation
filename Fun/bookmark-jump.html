<strong>bookmark-jump</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x r b, <menu-bar> <edit> <bookmark> <jump>.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-jump BOOKMARK &optional DISPLAY-FUNC)<br/>
<br/>
Jump to bookmark BOOKMARK (a point in some file).<br/>
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable<br/>
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some<br/>
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
If the file pointed to by BOOKMARK no longer exists, you will be asked<br/>
if you wish to give the bookmark a new location, and `bookmark-jump'<br/>
will then jump to the new location, as well as recording it in place<br/>
of the old one in the permanent bookmark record.<br/>
<br/>
BOOKMARK is usually a bookmark name (a string).  It can also be a<br/>
bookmark record, but this is usually only done by programmatic callers.<br/>
<br/>
If DISPLAY-FUNC is non-nil, it is a function to invoke to display the<br/>
bookmark.  It defaults to `switch-to-buffer'.  A typical value for<br/>
DISPLAY-FUNC would be `switch-to-buffer-other-window'.
