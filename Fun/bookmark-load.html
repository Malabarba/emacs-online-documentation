<strong>bookmark-load</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <edit> <bookmark> <load>.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-load FILE &optional OVERWRITE NO-MSG)<br/>
<br/>
Load bookmarks from FILE (which must be in bookmark format).<br/>
Appends loaded bookmarks to the front of the list of bookmarks.  If<br/>
optional second argument OVERWRITE is non-nil, existing bookmarks are<br/>
destroyed.  Optional third arg NO-MSG means don't display any messages<br/>
while loading.<br/>
<br/>
If you load a file that doesn't contain a proper bookmark alist, you<br/>
will corrupt Emacs's bookmark list.  Generally, you should only load<br/>
in files that were created with the bookmark functions in the first<br/>
place.  Your own personal bookmark file, `~/.emacs.bmk', is<br/>
maintained automatically by Emacs; you shouldn't need to load it<br/>
explicitly.<br/>
<br/>
If you load a file containing bookmarks with the same names as<br/>
bookmarks already present in your Emacs, the new bookmarks will get<br/>
unique numeric suffixes "<2>", "<3>", ... following the same<br/>
method buffers use to resolve name collisions.
