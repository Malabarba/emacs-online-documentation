<strong>bookmark-load</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;menu-bar> &lt;edit> &lt;bookmark> &lt;load>.</br>
</br>
<code>(bookmark-load <u>FILE</u> <em>&optional</em> <u>OVERWRITE</u> <u>NO-MSG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Load bookmarks from <u>FILE</u> (which must be in bookmark format).</br>
Appends loaded bookmarks to the front of the list of bookmarks.  If</br>
optional second argument <u>OVERWRITE</u> is non-nil, existing bookmarks are</br>
destroyed.  Optional third arg <u>NO-MSG</u> means don't display any messages</br>
while loading.</br>
</br>
If you load a file that doesn't contain a proper bookmark alist, you</br>
will corrupt Emacs's bookmark list.  Generally, you should only load</br>
in files that were created with the bookmark functions in the first</br>
place.  Your own personal bookmark file, `~/.emacs.bmk', is</br>
maintained automatically by Emacs; you shouldn't need to load it</br>
explicitly.</br>
</br>
If you load a file containing bookmarks with the same names as</br>
bookmarks already present in your Emacs, the new bookmarks will get</br>
unique numeric suffixes "&lt;2>", "&lt;3>", ... following the same</br>
method buffers use to resolve name collisions.
