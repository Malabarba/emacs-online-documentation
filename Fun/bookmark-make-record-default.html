<strong>bookmark-make-record-default</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(bookmark-make-record-default &optional <u>NO-FILE</u> <u>NO-CONTEXT</u> <u>POSN</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the record describing the location of a new bookmark.</br>
Point should be at the buffer in which the bookmark is being set,</br>
and normally should be at the position where the bookmark is desired,</br>
but see the optional arguments for other possibilities.</br>
</br>
If <u>NO-FILE</u> is non-nil, then only return the subset of the</br>
record that pertains to the location within the buffer, leaving off</br>
the part that records the filename.</br>
</br>
If <u>NO-CONTEXT</u> is non-nil, do not include the front- and rear-context</br>
strings in the record -- the position is enough.</br>
</br>
If <u>POSN</u> is non-nil, record <u>POSN</u> as the point instead of `(point)'.
