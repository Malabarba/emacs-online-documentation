<strong>bookmark-make-record-default</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-make-record-default &optional NO-FILE NO-CONTEXT POSN)<br/>
<br/>
Return the record describing the location of a new bookmark.<br/>
Point should be at the buffer in which the bookmark is being set,<br/>
and normally should be at the position where the bookmark is desired,<br/>
but see the optional arguments for other possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
If NO-FILE is non-nil, then only return the subset of the<br/>
record that pertains to the location within the buffer, leaving off<br/>
the part that records the filename.<br/>
<br/>
If NO-CONTEXT is non-nil, do not include the front- and rear-context<br/>
strings in the record -- the position is enough.<br/>
<br/>
If POSN is non-nil, record POSN as the point instead of `(point)'.
