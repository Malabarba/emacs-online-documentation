<strong>bookmark-maybe-historicize-string</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-maybe-historicize-string STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Put STRING into the bookmark prompt history, if caller non-interactive.<br/>
We need this because sometimes bookmark functions are invoked from<br/>
menus, so `completing-read' never gets a chance to set `bookmark-history'.
