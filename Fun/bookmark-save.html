<strong>bookmark-save</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <edit> <bookmark> <save>.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-save &optional PARG FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Save currently defined bookmarks.<br/>
Saves by default in the file defined by the variable<br/>
`bookmark-default-file'.  With a prefix arg, save it in file FILE<br/>
(second argument).<br/>
<br/>
If you are calling this from Lisp, the two arguments are PARG and<br/>
FILE, and if you just want it to write to the default file, then<br/>
pass no arguments.  Or pass in nil and FILE, and it will save in FILE<br/>
instead.  If you pass in one argument, and it is non-nil, then the<br/>
user will be interactively queried for a file to save in.<br/>
<br/>
When you want to load in the bookmarks from a file, use<br/>
`bookmark-load', M-x bookmark-load.  That function will prompt you<br/>
for a file, defaulting to the file defined by variable<br/>
`bookmark-default-file'.
