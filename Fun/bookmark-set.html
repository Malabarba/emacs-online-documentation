bookmark-set is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `bookmark.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x r m, <menu-bar> <edit> <bookmark> <set>.<br/><br/>(bookmark-set &optional NAME NO-OVERWRITE)<br/><br/>Set a bookmark named NAME at the current location.<br/>If name is nil, then prompt the user.<br/><br/>With a prefix arg (non-nil NO-OVERWRITE), do not overwrite any<br/>existing bookmark that has the same name as NAME, but instead push the<br/>new bookmark onto the bookmark alist.  The most recently set bookmark<br/>with name NAME is thus the one in effect at any given time, but the<br/>others are still there, should the user decide to delete the most<br/>recent one.<br/><br/>To yank words from the text of the buffer and use them as part of the<br/>bookmark name, type C-w while setting a bookmark.  Successive C-w's<br/>yank successive words.<br/><br/>Typing C-u inserts (at the bookmark name prompt) the name of the last<br/>bookmark used in the document where the new bookmark is being set;<br/>this helps you use a single bookmark name to track progress through a<br/>large document.  If there is no prior bookmark for this document, then<br/>C-u inserts an appropriate name based on the buffer or file.<br/><br/>Use M-x bookmark-delete to remove bookmarks (you give it a name and<br/>it removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name from<br/>the list of bookmarks.)
