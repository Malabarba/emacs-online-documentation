<strong>bookmark-time-to-save-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(bookmark-time-to-save-p &optional FINAL-TIME)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if it is time to save bookmarks to disk, nil otherwise.<br/>
Optional argument FINAL-TIME means this is being called when Emacs<br/>
is being killed, so save even if `bookmark-save-flag' is a number and<br/>
is greater than `bookmark-alist-modification-count'.
