buffer-chars-modified-tick is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(buffer-chars-modified-tick &optional BUFFER)<br/><br/>Return BUFFER's character-change tick counter.<br/>Each buffer has a character-change tick counter, which is set to the<br/>value of the buffer's tick counter (see `buffer-modified-tick'), each<br/>time text in that buffer is inserted or deleted.  By comparing the<br/>values returned by two individual calls of `buffer-chars-modified-tick',<br/>you can tell whether a character change occurred in that buffer in<br/>between these calls.  No argument or nil as argument means use current<br/>buffer as BUFFER.
