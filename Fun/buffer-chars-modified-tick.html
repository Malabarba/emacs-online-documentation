<strong>buffer-chars-modified-tick</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(buffer-chars-modified-tick &optional <u>BUFFER</u>)</br>
</br>
Return <u>BUFFER</u>'s character-change tick counter.</br>
Each buffer has a character-change tick counter, which is set to the</br>
value of the buffer's tick counter (see `buffer-modified-tick'), each</br>
time text in that buffer is inserted or deleted.  By comparing the</br>
values returned by two individual calls of `buffer-chars-modified-tick',</br>
you can tell whether a character change occurred in that buffer in</br>
between these calls.  No argument or nil as argument means use current</br>
buffer as <u>BUFFER</u>.
