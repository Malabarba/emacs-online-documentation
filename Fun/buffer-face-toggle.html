buffer-face-toggle is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `face-remap.el'.<br/><br/>(buffer-face-toggle &rest SPECS)<br/><br/>Toggle `buffer-face-mode', using face specs SPECS.<br/>Each argument in SPECS should be a face, i.e. either a face name<br/>or a property list of face attributes and values.  If more than<br/>one face is listed, that specifies an aggregate face, like in a<br/>`face' text property.<br/><br/>If `buffer-face-mode' is already enabled, and is currently using<br/>the face specs SPECS, then it is disabled; if buffer-face-mode is<br/>disabled, or is enabled and currently displaying some other face,<br/>then is left enabled, but the face changed to reflect SPECS.<br/><br/>This function will make the variable `buffer-face-mode-face'<br/>buffer local, and set it to SPECS.
