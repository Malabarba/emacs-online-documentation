</br>
</br>
(buffer-menu &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Switch to the Buffer Menu.</br>
By default, the Buffer Menu lists all buffers except those whose</br>
names start with a space (which are for internal use).  With</br>
prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, show only buffers that are visiting files.</br>
</br>
In the Buffer Menu, the first column (denoted "C") shows "."</br>
for the buffer from which you came, ">" for buffers you mark to</br>
be displayed, and "D" for those you mark for deletion.</br>
</br>
The "R" column has a "%" if the buffer is read-only.</br>
The "M" column has a "*" if it is modified, or "S" if you</br>
have marked it for saving.</br>
</br>
The remaining columns show the buffer name, the buffer size in</br>
characters, its major mode, and the visited file name (if any).</br>
</br>
See `Buffer-menu-mode' for the keybindings available the Buffer</br>
Menu.
