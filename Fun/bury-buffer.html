<strong>bury-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(bury-buffer &optional BUFFER-OR-NAME)<br/>
<br/>
Put BUFFER-OR-NAME at the end of the list of all buffers.<br/>
There it is the least likely candidate for `other-buffer' to<br/>
return; thus, the least likely buffer for C-x b to<br/>
select by default.<br/>
<br/>
You can specify a buffer name as BUFFER-OR-NAME, or an actual<br/>
buffer object.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is nil or omitted, bury the<br/>
current buffer.  Also, if BUFFER-OR-NAME is nil or omitted,<br/>
remove the current buffer from the selected window if it is<br/>
displayed there.
