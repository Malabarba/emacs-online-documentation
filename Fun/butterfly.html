(butterfly)<br/>
<br/>
Use butterflies to flip the desired bit on the drive platter.<br/>
Open hands and let the delicate wings flap once.  The disturbance<br/>
ripples outward, changing the flow of the eddy currents in the<br/>
upper atmosphere.  These cause momentary pockets of higher-pressure<br/>
air to form, which act as lenses that deflect incoming cosmic rays,<br/>
focusing them to strike the drive platter and flip the desired bit.<br/>
You can type `M-x butterfly C-M-c' to run it.  This is a permuted<br/>
variation of `C-x M-c M-butterfly' from url `http://xkcd.com/378/'.
