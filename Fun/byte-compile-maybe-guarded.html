<strong>byte-compile-maybe-guarded</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(byte-compile-maybe-guarded CONDITION &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Execute forms in BODY, potentially guarded by CONDITION.<br/>
CONDITION is a variable whose value is a test in an `if' or `cond'.<br/>
BODY is the code to compile in the first arm of the if or the body of<br/>
the cond clause.  If CONDITION's value is of the form (fboundp 'foo)<br/>
or (boundp 'foo), the relevant warnings from BODY about foo's<br/>
being undefined (or obsolete) will be suppressed.<br/>
<br/>
If CONDITION's value is (not (featurep 'emacs)) or (featurep 'xemacs),<br/>
that suppresses all warnings during execution of BODY.
