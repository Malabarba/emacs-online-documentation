<strong>byte-compile-unbind</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(byte-compile-unbind <u>CLAUSES</u> <u>INIT-LEXENV</u> <u>PRESERVE-BODY-VALUE</u>)</br>
</br>
Emit byte-codes to unbind the variables bound by <u>CLAUSES</u>.</br>
<u>CLAUSES</u> is a `let'-style variable binding list.  <u>INIT-LEXENV</u> should be a</br>
lexical-environment alist describing the positions of the init value that</br>
have been pushed on the stack.  If <u>PRESERVE-BODY-VALUE</u> is true,</br>
then an additional value on the top of the stack, above any lexical binding</br>
slots, is preserved, so it will be on the top of the stack after all</br>
binding slots have been popped.
