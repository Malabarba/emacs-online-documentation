<strong>byte-recompile-directory</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(byte-recompile-directory <u>DIRECTORY</u> &optional <u>ARG</u> <u>FORCE</u>)</br>
</br>
Recompile every `.el' file in <u>DIRECTORY</u> that needs recompilation.</br>
This happens when a `.elc' file exists but is older than the `.el' file.</br>
Files in subdirectories of <u>DIRECTORY</u> are processed also.</br>
</br>
If the `.elc' file does not exist, normally this function *does not*</br>
compile the corresponding `.el' file.  However, if the prefix argument</br>
<u>ARG</u> is 0, that means do compile all those files.  A nonzero</br>
<u>ARG</u> means ask the user, for each such `.el' file, whether to</br>
compile it.  A nonzero <u>ARG</u> also means ask about each subdirectory</br>
before scanning it.</br>
</br>
If the third argument <u>FORCE</u> is non-nil, recompile every `.el' file</br>
that already has a `.elc' file.
