byte-recompile-directory is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `bytecomp.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <menu-bar> <emacs-lisp> <byte-recompile>.<br/><br/>(byte-recompile-directory DIRECTORY &optional ARG FORCE)<br/><br/>Recompile every `.el' file in DIRECTORY that needs recompilation.<br/>This happens when a `.elc' file exists but is older than the `.el' file.<br/>Files in subdirectories of DIRECTORY are processed also.<br/><br/>If the `.elc' file does not exist, normally this function *does not*<br/>compile the corresponding `.el' file.  However, if the prefix argument<br/>ARG is 0, that means do compile all those files.  A nonzero<br/>ARG means ask the user, for each such `.el' file, whether to<br/>compile it.  A nonzero ARG also means ask about each subdirectory<br/>before scanning it.<br/><br/>If the third argument FORCE is non-nil, recompile every `.el' file<br/>that already has a `.elc' file.
