<strong>c-add-language</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-add-language MODE BASE-MODE)<br/>
<br/>
Declare a new language in the language dependent variable system.<br/>
This is intended to be used by modes that inherit CC Mode to add new<br/>
languages.  It should be used at the top level before any calls to<br/>
`c-lang-defconst'.  MODE is the mode name symbol for the new language,<br/>
and BASE-MODE is the mode name symbol for the language in CC Mode that<br/>
is to be the template for the new mode.<br/>
<br/>
The exact effect of BASE-MODE is to make all language constants that<br/>
haven't got a setting in the new language fall back to their values in<br/>
BASE-MODE.  It does not have any effect outside the language constant<br/>
system.
