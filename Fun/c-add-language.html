<strong>c-add-language</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-add-language <u>MODE</u> <u>BASE-MODE</u>)</br>
</br>
Declare a new language in the language dependent variable system.</br>
This is intended to be used by modes that inherit CC Mode to add new</br>
languages.  It should be used at the top level before any calls to</br>
`c-lang-defconst'.  <u>MODE</u> is the mode name symbol for the new language,</br>
and <u>BASE-MODE</u> is the mode name symbol for the language in CC Mode that</br>
is to be the template for the new mode.</br>
</br>
The exact effect of <u>BASE-MODE</u> is to make all language constants that</br>
haven't got a setting in the new language fall back to their values in</br>
<u>BASE-MODE</u>.  It does not have any effect outside the language constant</br>
system.
