<strong>c-at-expression-start-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-at-expression-start-p)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if the point is at the first token in an expression or</br>
statement, or somewhere in the syntactic whitespace before it.</br>
</br>
An "expression" here is a bit different from the normal language</br>
grammar sense: It's any sequence of expression tokens except commas,</br>
unless they are enclosed inside parentheses of some kind.  Also, an</br>
expression never continues past an enclosing parenthesis, but it might</br>
contain parenthesis pairs of any sort except braces.</br>
</br>
Since expressions never cross statement boundaries, this function also</br>
recognizes statement beginnings, just like `c-at-statement-start-p'.</br>
</br>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
