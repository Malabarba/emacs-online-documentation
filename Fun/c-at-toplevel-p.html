<strong>c-at-toplevel-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-at-toplevel-p)</br>
</br>
Return a determination as to whether point is "at the top level".</br>
Informally, "at the top level" is anywhere where you can write</br>
a function.</br>
</br>
More precisely, being at the top-level means that point is either</br>
outside any enclosing block (such as a function definition), or</br>
directly inside a class, namespace or other block that contains</br>
another declaration level.</br>
</br>
If point is not at the top-level (e.g. it is inside a method</br>
definition), then nil is returned.  Otherwise, if point is at a</br>
top-level not enclosed within a class definition, t is returned.</br>
Otherwise, a 2-vector is returned where the zeroth element is the</br>
buffer position of the start of the class declaration, and the first</br>
element is the buffer position of the enclosing class's opening</br>
brace.</br>
</br>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
