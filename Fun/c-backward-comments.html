<strong>c-backward-comments</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-backward-comments)</br>
</br>
Move backward past all preceding whitespace and comments.</br>
Line continuations, i.e. a backslashes followed by line breaks, are</br>
treated as whitespace.  The line breaks that end line comments are</br>
considered to be the comment enders, so the point cannot be at the end</br>
of the same line to move over a line comment.  Unlike</br>
c-backward-syntactic-ws, this function doesn't move back over</br>
preprocessor directives.</br>
</br>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
