<strong>c-backward-conditional</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-backward-conditional COUNT &optional TARGET-DEPTH WITH-ELSE)<br/>
<br/>
Move back across a preprocessor conditional, leaving mark behind.<br/>
A prefix argument acts as a repeat count.  With a negative argument,<br/>
move forward across a preprocessor conditional.<br/>
<br/>
The optional arguments TARGET-DEPTH and WITH-ELSE are historical,<br/>
and have the same meanings as in `c-scan-conditionals'.  If you<br/>
are calling c-forward-conditional from a program, you might want<br/>
to call `c-scan-conditionals' directly instead.
