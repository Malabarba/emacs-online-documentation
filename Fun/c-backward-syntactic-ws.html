<strong>c-backward-syntactic-ws</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-backward-syntactic-ws &optional LIMIT)<br/>
<br/>
Backward skip over syntactic whitespace.<br/>
Syntactic whitespace is defined as whitespace characters, comments,<br/>
and preprocessor directives.  However if point starts inside a comment<br/>
or preprocessor directive, the content of it is not treated as<br/>
whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
LIMIT sets a lower limit of the backward movement, if specified.  If<br/>
LIMIT is reached inside a line comment or preprocessor directive then<br/>
the point is moved into it past the whitespace at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
