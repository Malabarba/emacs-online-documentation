<strong>c-backward-token-1</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-backward-token-1 &optional <u>COUNT</u> <u>BALANCED</u> <u>LIMIT</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `c-backward-token-2' but doesn't treat multicharacter operator</br>
tokens like "==" as single tokens, i.e. all sequences of symbol</br>
characters are jumped over character by character.  This function is</br>
for compatibility only; it's only a wrapper over `c-backward-token-2'.
