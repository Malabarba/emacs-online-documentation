<strong>c-basic-common-init</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-basic-common-init <u>MODE</u> <u>DEFAULT-STYLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Do the necessary initialization for the syntax handling routines</br>
and the line breaking/filling code.  Intended to be used by other</br>
packages that embed CC Mode.</br>
</br>
<u>MODE</u> is the CC Mode flavor to set up, e.g. 'c-mode or 'java-mode.</br>
<u>DEFAULT-STYLE</u> tells which indentation style to install.  It has the</br>
same format as `c-default-style'.</br>
</br>
Note that `c-init-language-vars' must be called before this function.</br>
This function cannot do that since `c-init-language-vars' is a macro</br>
that requires a literal mode spec at compile time.
