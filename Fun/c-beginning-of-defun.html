c-beginning-of-defun is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `cc-cmds.el'.<br/><br/>(c-beginning-of-defun &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Move backward to the beginning of a defun.<br/>Every top level declaration that contains a brace paren block is<br/>considered to be a defun.<br/><br/>With a positive argument, move backward that many defuns.  A negative<br/>argument -N means move forward to the Nth following beginning.  Return<br/>t unless search stops due to beginning or end of buffer.<br/><br/>Unlike the built-in `beginning-of-defun' this tries to be smarter<br/>about finding the char with open-parenthesis syntax that starts the<br/>defun.
