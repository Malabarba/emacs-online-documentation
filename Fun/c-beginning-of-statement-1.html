<strong>c-beginning-of-statement-1</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-beginning-of-statement-1 &optional LIM IGNORE-LABELS NOERROR COMMA-DELIM)<br/>
<br/>
Move to the start of the current statement or declaration, or to<br/>
the previous one if already at the beginning of one.  Only<br/>
statements/declarations on the same level are considered, i.e. don't<br/>
move into or out of sexps (not even normal expression parentheses).<br/>
<br/>
If point is already at the earliest statement within braces or parens,<br/>
this function doesn't move back into any whitespace preceding it; it<br/>
returns 'same in this case.<br/>
<br/>
Stop at statement continuation tokens like "else", "catch",<br/>
"finally" and the "while" in "do ... while" if the start point<br/>
is within the continuation.  If starting at such a token, move to the<br/>
corresponding statement start.  If at the beginning of a statement,<br/>
move to the closest containing statement if there is any.  This might<br/>
also stop at a continuation clause.<br/>
<br/>
Labels are treated as part of the following statements if<br/>
IGNORE-LABELS is non-nil.  (FIXME: Doesn't work if we stop at a known<br/>
statement start keyword.)  Otherwise, each label is treated as a<br/>
separate statement.<br/>
<br/>
Macros are ignored (i.e. skipped over) unless point is within one, in<br/>
which case the content of the macro is treated as normal code.  Aside<br/>
from any normal statement starts found in it, stop at the first token<br/>
of the content in the macro, i.e. the expression of an "#if" or the<br/>
start of the definition in a "#define".  Also stop at start of<br/>
macros before leaving them.<br/>
<br/>
Return:<br/>
'label          if stopped at a label or "case...:" or "default:";<br/>
'same           if stopped at the beginning of the current statement;<br/>
'up             if stepped to a containing statement;<br/>
'previous       if stepped to a preceding statement;<br/>
'beginning      if stepped from a statement continuation clause to<br/>
                its start clause; or<br/>
'macro          if stepped to a macro start.<br/>
Note that 'same and not 'label is returned if stopped at the same<br/>
label without crossing the colon character.<br/>
<br/>
LIM may be given to limit the search.  If the search hits the limit,<br/>
point will be left at the closest following token, or at the start<br/>
position if that is less ('same is returned in this case).<br/>
<br/>
NOERROR turns off error logging to `c-parsing-error'.<br/>
<br/>
Normally only ';' and virtual semicolons are considered to delimit<br/>
statements, but if COMMA-DELIM is non-nil then ',' is treated<br/>
as a delimiter too.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
