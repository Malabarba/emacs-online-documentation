<strong>c-beginning-of-statement</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-beginning-of-statement &optional COUNT LIM SENTENCE-FLAG)<br/>
<br/>
Go to the beginning of the innermost C statement.<br/>
With prefix arg, go back N - 1 statements.  If already at the<br/>
beginning of a statement then go to the beginning of the closest<br/>
preceding one, moving into nested blocks if necessary (use<br/>
C-M-b to skip over a block).  If within or next to a<br/>
comment or multiline string, move by sentences instead of statements.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a program, this function takes 3 optional args: the<br/>
repetition count, a buffer position limit which is the farthest back<br/>
to search for the syntactic context, and a flag saying whether to do<br/>
sentence motion in or near comments and multiline strings.<br/>
<br/>
Note that for use in programs, `c-beginning-of-statement-1' is<br/>
usually better.  It has much better defined semantics than this one,<br/>
which is intended for interactive use, and might therefore change to<br/>
be more "DWIM:ey".
