<strong>c-collect-line-comments</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-collect-line-comments RANGE)<br/>
<br/>
If the argument is a cons of two buffer positions (such as returned by<br/>
`c-literal-limits'), and that range contains a C++ style line comment,<br/>
then an extended range is returned that contains all adjacent line<br/>
comments (i.e. all comments that starts in the same column with no<br/>
empty lines or non-whitespace characters between them).  Otherwise the<br/>
argument is returned.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
