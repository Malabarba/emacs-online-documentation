<strong>c-comment-line-break-function</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="c-indent-new-comment-line.html">c-indent-new-comment-line</a></strong>' in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-comment-line-break-function &optional <u>SOFT</u> <u>ALLOW-AUTO-FILL</u>)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 21.1;</br>
use `c-indent-new-comment-line' instead.</br>
</br>
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment or macro if within one.</br>
If inside a comment and `comment-multi-line' is non-nil, the</br>
indentation and line prefix are preserved (see the</br>
`c-comment-prefix-regexp' and `c-block-comment-prefix' variables for</br>
details).  If inside a single line comment and `comment-multi-line' is</br>
nil, a new comment of the same type is started on the next line and</br>
indented as appropriate for comments.  If inside a macro, a line</br>
continuation backslash is inserted and aligned as appropriate, and the</br>
new line is indented according to `c-syntactic-indentation'.</br>
</br>
If a fill prefix is specified, it overrides all the above.
