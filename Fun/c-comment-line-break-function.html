If inside a single line comment and `comment-multi-line' is<br/>nil, a new comment of the same type is started on the next line and<br/>indented as appropriate for comments.  If inside a macro, a line<br/>continuation backslash is inserted and aligned as appropriate, and the<br/>new line is indented according to `c-syntactic-indentation'.<br/><br/>If a fill prefix is specified, it overrides all the above.
