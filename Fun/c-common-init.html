c-common-init is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(c-common-init &optional MODE)<br/><br/>Common initialization for all CC Mode modes.<br/>In addition to the work done by `c-basic-common-init' and<br/>`c-font-lock-init', this function sets up various other things as<br/>customary in CC Mode modes but which aren't strictly necessary for CC<br/>Mode to operate correctly.<br/><br/>MODE is the symbol for the mode to initialize, like 'c-mode.  See<br/>`c-basic-common-init' for details.  It's only optional to be<br/>compatible with old code; callers should always specify it.
