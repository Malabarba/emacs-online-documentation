<strong>c-context-line-break</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-context-line-break)</br>
</br>
Do a line break suitable to the context.</br>
</br>
When point is outside a comment or macro, insert a newline and indent</br>
according to the syntactic context, unless `c-syntactic-indentation'</br>
is nil, in which case the new line is indented as the previous</br>
non-empty line instead.</br>
</br>
When point is inside the content of a preprocessor directive, a line</br>
continuation backslash is inserted before the line break and aligned</br>
appropriately.  The end of the cpp directive doesn't count as inside</br>
it.</br>
</br>
When point is inside a comment, continue it with the appropriate</br>
comment prefix (see the `c-comment-prefix-regexp' and</br>
`c-block-comment-prefix' variables for details).  The end of a</br>
C++-style line comment doesn't count as inside it.</br>
</br>
When point is inside a string, only insert a backslash when it is also</br>
inside a preprocessor directive.
