<strong>c-crosses-statement-barrier-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-crosses-statement-barrier-p FROM TO)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if buffer positions FROM to TO cross one or more<br/>
statement or declaration boundaries.  The returned value is actually<br/>
the position of the earliest boundary char.  FROM must not be within<br/>
a string or comment.<br/>
<br/>
The variable `c-maybe-labelp' is set to the position of the first `:' that<br/>
might start a label (i.e. not part of `::' and not preceded by `?').  If a<br/>
single `?' is found, then `c-maybe-labelp' is cleared.<br/>
<br/>
For AWK, a statement which is terminated by an EOL (not a ; or a }) is<br/>
regarded as having a "virtual semicolon" immediately after the last token on<br/>
the line.  If this virtual semicolon is _at_ from, the function recognizes it.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
