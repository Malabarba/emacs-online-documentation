<strong>c-down-conditional</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-down-conditional <u>COUNT</u>)</br>
</br>
Move forward into the next preprocessor conditional, leaving mark behind.</br>
A prefix argument acts as a repeat count.  With a negative argument,</br>
move backward into the previous preprocessor conditional.</br>
</br>
"#elif" is treated like "#else" followed by "#if", so the</br>
function stops at them when going forward, but not when going</br>
backward.
