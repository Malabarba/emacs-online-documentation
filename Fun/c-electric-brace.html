c-electric-brace is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `cc-cmds.el'.<br/><br/>(c-electric-brace ARG)<br/><br/>Insert a brace.<br/><br/>If `c-electric-flag' is non-nil, the brace is not inside a literal and a<br/>numeric ARG hasn't been supplied, the command performs several electric<br/>actions:<br/><br/>(a) If the auto-newline feature is turned on (indicated by "/la" on<br/>the mode line) newlines are inserted before and after the brace as<br/>directed by the settings in `c-hanging-braces-alist'.<br/><br/>(b) Any auto-newlines are indented.  The original line is also<br/>reindented unless `c-syntactic-indentation' is nil.<br/><br/>(c) If auto-newline is turned on, various newline cleanups based on the<br/>settings of `c-cleanup-list' are done.
