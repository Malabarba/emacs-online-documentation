<strong>c-electric-colon</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-electric-colon <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert a colon.</br>
</br>
If `c-electric-flag' is non-nil, the colon is not inside a literal and a</br>
numeric <u>ARG</u> hasn't been supplied, the command performs several electric</br>
actions:</br>
</br>
<code>(a) If the auto-newline feature is turned on (indicated by "/la" o</code>n</br>
the mode line) newlines are inserted before and after the colon based on</br>
the settings in `c-hanging-colons-alist'.</br>
</br>
(b) Any auto-newlines are indented.  The original line is also</br>
reindented unless `c-syntactic-indentation' is nil.</br>
</br>
(c) If auto-newline is turned on, whitespace between two colons will be</br>
"cleaned up" leaving a scope operator, if this action is set in</br>
`c-cleanup-list'.
