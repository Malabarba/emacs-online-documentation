<strong>c-electric-colon</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-electric-colon ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Insert a colon.<br/>
<br/>
If `c-electric-flag' is non-nil, the colon is not inside a literal and a<br/>
numeric ARG hasn't been supplied, the command performs several electric<br/>
actions:<br/>
<br/>
(a) If the auto-newline feature is turned on (indicated by "/la" on<br/>
the mode line) newlines are inserted before and after the colon based on<br/>
the settings in `c-hanging-colons-alist'.<br/>
<br/>
(b) Any auto-newlines are indented.  The original line is also<br/>
reindented unless `c-syntactic-indentation' is nil.<br/>
<br/>
(c) If auto-newline is turned on, whitespace between two colons will be<br/>
"cleaned up" leaving a scope operator, if this action is set in<br/>
`c-cleanup-list'.
