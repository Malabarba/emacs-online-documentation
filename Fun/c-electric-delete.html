<strong>c-electric-delete</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-electric-delete ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Deletes preceding or following character or whitespace.<br/>
This function either deletes forward as `c-electric-delete-forward' or<br/>
backward as `c-electric-backspace', depending on the configuration: If<br/>
the function `delete-forward-p' is defined and returns non-nil, it<br/>
deletes forward.  Otherwise it deletes backward.<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is the way in XEmacs to choose the correct action for the<br/>
[delete] key, whichever key that means.  Other flavors don't use this<br/>
function to control that.
