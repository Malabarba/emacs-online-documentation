<strong>c-electric-semi&comma</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-electric-semi&comma <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert a comma or semicolon.</br>
</br>
If `c-electric-flag' is non-nil, point isn't inside a literal and a</br>
numeric <u>ARG</u> hasn't been supplied, the command performs several electric</br>
actions:</br>
</br>
<code>(a) When the auto-newline feature is turned on (indicated by "/la" o</code>n</br>
the mode line) a newline might be inserted.  See the variable</br>
`c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria' for how newline insertion is determined.</br>
</br>
(b) Any auto-newlines are indented.  The original line is also</br>
reindented unless `c-syntactic-indentation' is nil.</br>
</br>
(c) If auto-newline is turned on, a comma following a brace list or a</br>
semicolon following a defun might be cleaned up, depending on the</br>
settings of `c-cleanup-list'.
