c-electric-slash is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `cc-cmds.el'.<br/><br/>(c-electric-slash ARG)<br/><br/>Insert a slash character.<br/><br/>If the slash is inserted immediately after the comment prefix in a c-style<br/>comment, the comment might get closed by removing whitespace and possibly<br/>inserting a "*".  See the variable `c-cleanup-list'.<br/><br/>Indent the line as a comment, if:<br/><br/>  1. The slash is second of a "//" line oriented comment introducing<br/>     token and we are on a comment-only-line, or<br/><br/>  2. The slash is part of a "*/" token that closes a block oriented<br/>     comment.<br/><br/>If a numeric ARG is supplied, point is inside a literal, or<br/>`c-syntactic-indentation' is nil or `c-electric-flag' is nil, indentation<br/>is inhibited.
