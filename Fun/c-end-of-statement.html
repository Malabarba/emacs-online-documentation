<strong>c-end-of-statement</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-end-of-statement &optional COUNT LIM SENTENCE-FLAG)<br/>
<br/>
Go to the end of the innermost C statement.<br/>
With prefix arg, go forward N - 1 statements.  Move forward to the end<br/>
of the next statement if already at end, and move into nested blocks<br/>
(use C-M-f to skip over a block).  If within or next to a<br/>
comment or multiline string, move by sentences instead of statements.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a program, this function takes 3 optional args: the<br/>
repetition count, a buffer position limit which is the farthest back<br/>
to search for the syntactic context, and a flag saying whether to do<br/>
sentence motion in or near comments and multiline strings.
