<strong>c-fill-paragraph</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-fill-paragraph &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Like M-q but handles C and C++ style comments.</br>
If any of the current line is a comment or within a comment, fill the</br>
comment or the paragraph of it that point is in, preserving the</br>
comment indentation or line-starting decorations (see the</br>
`c-comment-prefix-regexp' and `c-block-comment-prefix' variables for</br>
details).</br>
</br>
If point is inside multiline string literal, fill it.  This currently</br>
does not respect escaped newlines, except for the special case when it</br>
is the very first thing in the string.  The intended use for this rule</br>
is in situations like the following:</br>
</br>
char description[] = "\</br>
A very long description of something that you want to fill to make</br>
nicely formatted output.";</br>
</br>
If point is in any other situation, i.e. in normal code, do nothing.</br>
</br>
Optional prefix <u>ARG</u> means justify paragraph as well.
