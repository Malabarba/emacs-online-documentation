<strong>c-forward-conditional</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-forward-conditional <u>COUNT</u> &optional <u>TARGET-DEPTH</u> <u>WITH-ELSE</u>)</br>
</br>
Move forward across a preprocessor conditional, leaving mark behind.</br>
A prefix argument acts as a repeat count.  With a negative argument,</br>
move backward across a preprocessor conditional.</br>
</br>
If there aren't enough conditionals after (or before) point, an</br>
error is signaled.</br>
</br>
"#elif" is treated like "#else" followed by "#if", except that</br>
the nesting level isn't changed when tracking subconditionals.</br>
</br>
The optional arguments <u>TARGET-DEPTH</u> and <u>WITH-ELSE</u> are historical,</br>
and have the same meanings as in `c-scan-conditionals'.  If you</br>
are calling c-forward-conditional from a program, you might want</br>
to call `c-scan-conditionals' directly instead.
