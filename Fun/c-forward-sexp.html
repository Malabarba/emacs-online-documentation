<strong>c-forward-sexp</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-forward-sexp &optional <u>COUNT</u>)</br>
</br>
Move forward across <u>COUNT</u> balanced expressions.</br>
A negative <u>COUNT</u> means move backward.  Signal an error if the move</br>
fails for any reason.</br>
</br>
This is like `forward-sexp' except that it isn't interactive and does</br>
not do any user friendly adjustments of the point and that it isn't</br>
susceptible to user configurations such as disabling of signals in</br>
certain situations.
