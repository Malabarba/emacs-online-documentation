</br>
(c-forward-single-comment)</br>
</br>
Move forward past whitespace and the closest following comment, if any.</br>
Return t if a comment was found, nil otherwise.  In either case, the</br>
point is moved past the following whitespace.  Line continuations,</br>
i.e. a backslashes followed by line breaks, are treated as whitespace.</br>

comment enders, so the point will be put on the beginning of the next</br>
line if it moved past a line comment.</br>

This function does not do any hidden buffer changes.
