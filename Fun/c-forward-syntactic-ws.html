c-forward-syntactic-ws is a Lisp macro in `cc-defs.el'.<br/><br/>(c-forward-syntactic-ws &optional LIMIT)<br/><br/>Forward skip over syntactic whitespace.<br/>Syntactic whitespace is defined as whitespace characters, comments,<br/>and preprocessor directives.  However if point starts inside a comment<br/>or preprocessor directive, the content of it is not treated as<br/>whitespace.<br/><br/>LIMIT sets an upper limit of the forward movement, if specified.  If<br/>LIMIT or the end of the buffer is reached inside a comment or<br/>preprocessor directive, the point will be left there.<br/><br/>Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
