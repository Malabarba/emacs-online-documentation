<strong>c-forward-token-1</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-forward-token-1 &optional COUNT BALANCED LIMIT)<br/>
<br/>
Like `c-forward-token-2' but doesn't treat multicharacter operator<br/>
tokens like "==" as single tokens, i.e. all sequences of symbol<br/>
characters are jumped over character by character.  This function is<br/>
for compatibility only; it's only a wrapper over `c-forward-token-2'.
