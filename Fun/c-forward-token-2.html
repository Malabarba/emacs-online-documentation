c-forward-token-2 is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-engine.el'.<br/><br/>(c-forward-token-2 &optional COUNT BALANCED LIMIT)<br/><br/>Move forward by tokens.<br/>A token is defined as all symbols and identifiers which aren't<br/>syntactic whitespace (note that multicharacter tokens like "==" are<br/>treated properly).  Point is always either left at the beginning of a<br/>token or not moved at all.  COUNT specifies the number of tokens to<br/>move; a negative COUNT moves in the opposite direction.  A COUNT of 0<br/>moves to the next token beginning only if not already at one.  If<br/>BALANCED is true, move over balanced parens, otherwise move into them.<br/>Also, if BALANCED is true, never move out of an enclosing paren.<br/><br/>LIMIT sets the limit for the movement and defaults to the point limit.<br/>The case when LIMIT is set in the middle of a token, comment or macro<br/>is handled correctly, i.e. the point won't be left there.<br/><br/>Return the number of tokens left to move (positive or negative).  If<br/>BALANCED is true, a move over a balanced paren counts as one.  Note<br/>that if COUNT is 0 and no appropriate token beginning is found, 1 will<br/>be returned.  Thus, a return value of 0 guarantees that point is at<br/>the requested position and a return value less (without signs) than<br/>COUNT guarantees that point is at the beginning of some token.<br/><br/>Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
