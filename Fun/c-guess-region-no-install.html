c-guess-region-no-install is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `cc-guess.el'.<br/><br/>(c-guess-region-no-install START END &optional ACCUMULATE)<br/><br/>Guess the style on the region; don't install it.<br/><br/>Every line of code in the region is examined and values for the following two<br/>variables are guessed:<br/><br/>* `c-basic-offset', and<br/>* the indentation values of the various syntactic symbols in<br/>  `c-offsets-alist'.<br/><br/>The guessed values are put into `c-guess-guessed-basic-offset' and<br/>`c-guess-guessed-offsets-alist'.<br/><br/>Frequencies of use are taken into account when guessing, so minor<br/>inconsistencies in the indentation style shouldn't produce wrong guesses.<br/><br/>If given a prefix argument (or if the optional argument ACCUMULATE is<br/>non-nil) then the previous examination is extended, otherwise a new<br/>guess is made from scratch.<br/><br/>Note that the larger the region to guess in, the slower the guessing.<br/>So you can limit the region with `c-guess-region-max'.
