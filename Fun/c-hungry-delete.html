<strong>c-hungry-delete</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-hungry-delete)</br>
</br>
Delete a non-whitespace char, or all whitespace up to the next non-whitespace char.</br>
The direction of deletion depends on the configuration: If the</br>
function `delete-forward-p' is defined and returns non-nil, it deletes</br>
forward using `c-hungry-delete-forward'.  Otherwise it deletes</br>
backward using `c-hungry-backspace'.</br>
</br>
Note: This is the way in XEmacs to choose the correct action for the</br>
[delete] key, whichever key that means.  Other flavors don't use this</br>
function to control that.
