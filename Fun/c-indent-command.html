<strong>c-indent-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-indent-command &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Indent current line as C code, and/or insert some whitespace.</br>
</br>
If `c-tab-always-indent' is t, always just indent the current line.</br>
If nil, indent the current line only if point is at the left margin or</br>
in the line's indentation; otherwise insert some whitespace[*].  If</br>
other than nil or t, then some whitespace[*] is inserted only within</br>
literals (comments and strings), but the line is always reindented.</br>
</br>
If `c-syntactic-indentation' is t, indentation is done according to</br>
the syntactic context.  A numeric argument, regardless of its value,</br>
means indent rigidly all the lines of the expression starting after</br>
point so that this line becomes properly indented.  The relative</br>
indentation among the lines of the expression is preserved.</br>
</br>
If `c-syntactic-indentation' is nil, the line is just indented one</br>
step according to `c-basic-offset'.  In this mode, a numeric argument</br>
indents a number of such steps, positive or negative, and an empty</br>
prefix argument is equivalent to -1.</br>
</br>
  [*] The amount and kind of whitespace inserted is controlled by the</br>
  variable `c-insert-tab-function', which is called to do the actual</br>
  insertion of whitespace.  Normally the function in this variable</br>
  just inserts a tab character, or the equivalent number of spaces,</br>
  depending on the variable `indent-tabs-mode'.
