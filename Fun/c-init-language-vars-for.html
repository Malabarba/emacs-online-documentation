<strong>c-init-language-vars-for</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-init-language-vars-for <u>MODE</u>)</br>
</br>
Initialize the language variables for one of the language modes</br>
directly supported by CC Mode.  This can be used instead of the</br>
`c-init-language-vars' macro if the language you want to use is one of</br>
those, rather than a derived language defined through the language</br>
variable system (see "cc-langs.el").
