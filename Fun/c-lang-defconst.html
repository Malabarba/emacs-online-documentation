</br>
(c-lang-defconst <u>NAME</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the language specific values of the language constant <u>NAME</u>.</br>
The second argument can optionally be a docstring.  The rest of the</br>
arguments are one or more repetitions of LANG VAL where LANG specifies</br>
the language(s) that VAL applies to.  LANG is the name of the</br>
language, i.e. the mode name without the "-mode" suffix, or a list</br>
of such language names, or `t' for all languages.  VAL is a form to</br>
evaluate to get the value.</br>
</br>
If LANG isn't `t' or one of the core languages in CC Mode, it must</br>
have been declared with `c-add-language'.</br>
</br>
Neither <u>NAME</u>, LANG nor VAL are evaluated directly - they should not be</br>
quoted.  `c-lang-defconst-eval-immediately' can however be used inside</br>
VAL to evaluate parts of it directly.</br>
</br>
When VAL is evaluated for some language, that language is temporarily</br>
made current so that `c-lang-const' without an explicit language can</br>
be used inside VAL to refer to the value of a language constant in the</br>
same language.  That is particularly useful if LANG is `t'.</br>
</br>
VAL is not evaluated right away but rather when the value is requested</br>
with `c-lang-const'.  Thus it's possible to use `c-lang-const' inside</br>
VAL to refer to language constants that haven't been defined yet.</br>
However, if the definition of a language constant is in another file</br>
then that file must be loaded (at compile time) before it's safe to</br>
reference the constant.</br>
</br>
The assignments in <u>ARGS</u> are processed in sequence like `setq', so</br>
(c-lang-const <u>NAME</u>) may be used inside a VAL to refer to the last</br>
assigned value to this language constant, or a value that it has</br>
gotten in another earlier loaded file.</br>
</br>
To work well with repeated loads and interactive reevaluation, only</br>
one `c-lang-defconst' for each <u>NAME</u> is permitted per file.  If there</br>
already is one it will be completely replaced; the value in the</br>
earlier definition will not affect `c-lang-const' on the same</br>
constant.  A file is identified by its base name.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
