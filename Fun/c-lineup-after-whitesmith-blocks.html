c-lineup-after-whitesmith-blocks is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-align.el'.<br/><br/>(c-lineup-after-whitesmith-blocks LANGELEM)<br/><br/>Compensate for Whitesmith style indentation of blocks.<br/>Due to the way CC Mode calculates anchor positions for normal lines<br/>inside blocks, this function is necessary for those lines to get<br/>correct Whitesmith style indentation.  Consider the following<br/>examples:<br/><br/>                    int foo()<br/>                        {<br/>int foo()                   {<br/>    {                       a;<br/>    a;                      }<br/>    x;       <->        x;        <- c-lineup-after-whitesmith-blocks<br/><br/>The fact that the line with "x" is preceded by a Whitesmith style<br/>indented block in one case and not the other should not affect its<br/>indentation.  But since CC Mode in cases like this uses the<br/>indentation of the preceding statement as anchor position, the "x"<br/>would in the rightmost case be indented too much if the offset for<br/>`statement' was set simply to zero.<br/><br/>This lineup function corrects for this situation by detecting if the<br/>anchor position is at an open paren character.  In that case, it<br/>instead indents relative to the surrounding block just like<br/>`c-lineup-whitesmith-in-block'.<br/><br/>Works with: brace-list-entry, brace-entry-open, statement,<br/>arglist-cont.
