c-lineup-arglist is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-align.el'.<br/><br/>(c-lineup-arglist LANGELEM)<br/><br/>Line up the current argument line under the first argument.<br/><br/>As a special case, if the indented line is inside a brace block<br/>construct, the indentation is `c-basic-offset' only.  This is intended<br/>as a "DWIM" measure in cases like macros that contains statement<br/>blocks, e.g.:<br/><br/>A_VERY_LONG_MACRO_NAME ({<br/>        some (code, with + long, lines * in[it]);<br/>    });<br/><--> c-basic-offset<br/><br/>This is motivated partly because it's more in line with how code<br/>blocks are handled, and partly since it approximates the behavior of<br/>earlier CC Mode versions, which due to inaccurate analysis tended to<br/>indent such cases this way.<br/><br/>Works with: arglist-cont-nonempty, arglist-close.
