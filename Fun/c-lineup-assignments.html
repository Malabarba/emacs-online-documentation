<strong>c-lineup-assignments</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-lineup-assignments <u>LANGELEM</u>)</br>
</br>
Line up the current line after the assignment operator on the first</br>
line in the statement.  If there isn't any, return nil to allow</br>
stacking with other line-up functions.  If the current line contains</br>
an assignment operator too, try to align it with the first one.</br>

arglist-cont-nonempty.
