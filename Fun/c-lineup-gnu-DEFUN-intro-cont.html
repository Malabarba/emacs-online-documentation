c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-intro-cont is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-align.el'.<br/><br/>(c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-intro-cont LANGELEM)<br/><br/>Line up the continuation lines of a DEFUN macro in the Emacs C source.<br/>These lines are indented as though they were `knr-argdecl-intro' lines.<br/>Return nil when we're not in such a construct.<br/><br/>This function is for historical compatibility with how previous CC Modes (5.28<br/>and earlier) indented such lines.<br/><br/>Here is an example:<br/><br/>DEFUN ("forward-char", Fforward_char, Sforward_char, 0, 1, "p",<br/>       doc: /* Move point right N characters (left if N is negative).<br/>On reaching end of buffer, stop and signal error.  */)<br/>     (n)                      <- c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-into-cont<br/>     Lisp_Object n;           <- c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-into-cont<br/><br/>Works with: topmost-intro-cont.
