<strong>c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-intro-cont</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-intro-cont <u>LANGELEM</u>)</br>
</br>
Line up the continuation lines of a DEFUN macro in the Emacs C source.</br>
These lines are indented as though they were `knr-argdecl-intro' lines.</br>
Return nil when we're not in such a construct.</br>
</br>
This function is for historical compatibility with how previous CC Modes (5.28</br>
and earlier) indented such lines.</br>
</br>
Here is an example:</br>
</br>
DEFUN ("forward-char", Fforward_char, Sforward_char, 0, 1, "p",</br>
       doc: /* Move point right N characters (left if N is negative).</br>
On reaching end of buffer, stop and signal error.  */)</br>
     (n)                      &lt;- c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-into-cont</br>
     Lisp_Object n;           &lt;- c-lineup-gnu-DEFUN-into-cont</br>
</br>
Works with: topmost-intro-cont.
