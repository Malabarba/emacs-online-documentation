<strong>c-literal-limits-fast</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="c-literal-limits.html">c-literal-limits</a></strong>' in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-literal-limits-fast &optional <u>LIM</u> <u>NEAR</u> <u>NOT-IN-DELIMITER</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a cons of the beginning and end positions of the comment or</br>
string surrounding point (including both delimiters), or nil if point</br>
isn't in one.  If <u>LIM</u> is non-nil, it's used as the "safe" position</br>
to start parsing from.  If <u>NEAR</u> is non-nil, then the limits of any</br>
literal next to point is returned.  "Next to" means there's only</br>
spaces and tabs between point and the literal.  The search for such a</br>
literal is done first in forward direction.  If <u>NOT-IN-DELIMITER</u> is</br>
non-nil, the case when point is inside a starting delimiter won't be</br>
recognized.  This only has effect for comments which have starting</br>
delimiters with more than one character.</br>
</br>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
