<strong>c-literal-limits-fast</strong> is an alias for `c-literal-limits' in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-literal-limits-fast &optional LIM NEAR NOT-IN-DELIMITER)<br/>
<br/>
Return a cons of the beginning and end positions of the comment or<br/>
string surrounding point (including both delimiters), or nil if point<br/>
isn't in one.  If LIM is non-nil, it's used as the "safe" position<br/>
to start parsing from.  If NEAR is non-nil, then the limits of any<br/>
literal next to point is returned.  "Next to" means there's only<br/>
spaces and tabs between point and the literal.  The search for such a<br/>
literal is done first in forward direction.  If NOT-IN-DELIMITER is<br/>
non-nil, the case when point is inside a starting delimiter won't be<br/>
recognized.  This only has effect for comments which have starting<br/>
delimiters with more than one character.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
