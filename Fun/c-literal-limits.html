</br>
(c-literal-limits &optional <u>LIM</u> <u>NEAR</u> <u>NOT-IN-DELIMITER</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a cons of the beginning and end positions of the comment or</br>
string surrounding point (including both delimiters), or nil if point</br>
isn't in one.  If <u>LIM</u> is non-nil, it's used as the "safe" position</br>
to start parsing from.  If <u>NEAR</u> is non-nil, then the limits of any</br>
literal next to point is returned.  "Next to" means there's only</br>
spaces and tabs between point and the literal.  The search for such a</br>
literal is done first in forward direction.  If <u>NOT-IN-DELIMITER</u> is</br>
non-nil, the case when point is inside a starting delimiter won't be</br>
recognized.  This only has effect for comments which have starting</br>
delimiters with more than one character.</br>
</br>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
