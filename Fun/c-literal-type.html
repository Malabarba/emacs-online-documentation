<strong>c-literal-type</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-literal-type <u>RANGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Convenience function that given the result of `c-literal-limits',</br>
returns nil or the type of literal that the range surrounds, one</br>
of the symbols 'c, 'c++ or 'string.  It's much faster than using</br>
`c-in-literal' and is intended to be used when you need both the</br>
type of a literal and its limits.</br>
</br>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
