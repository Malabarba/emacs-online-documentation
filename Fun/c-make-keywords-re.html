c-make-keywords-re is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-defs.el'.<br/><br/>(c-make-keywords-re ADORN LIST &optional MODE)<br/><br/>Make a regexp that matches all the strings the list.<br/>Duplicates and nil elements in the list are removed.  The resulting<br/>regexp may contain zero or more submatch expressions.<br/><br/>If ADORN is t there will be at least one submatch and the first<br/>surrounds the matched alternative, and the regexp will also not match<br/>a prefix of any identifier.  Adorned regexps cannot be appended.  The<br/>language variable `c-nonsymbol-key' is used to make the adornment.<br/><br/>A value 'appendable for ADORN is like above, but all alternatives in<br/>the list that end with a word constituent char will have \> appended<br/>instead, so that the regexp remains appendable.  Note that this<br/>variant doesn't always guarantee that an identifier prefix isn't<br/>matched since the symbol constituent '_' is normally considered a<br/>nonword token by \>.<br/><br/>The optional MODE specifies the language to get `c-nonsymbol-key' from<br/>when it's needed.  The default is the current language taken from<br/>`c-buffer-is-cc-mode'.
