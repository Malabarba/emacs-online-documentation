<strong>c-make-keywords-re</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-make-keywords-re <u>ADORN</u> <u>LIST</u> &optional <u>MODE</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a regexp that matches all the strings the list.</br>
Duplicates and nil elements in the list are removed.  The</br>
resulting regexp may contain zero or more submatch expressions.</br>
</br>
If <u>ADORN</u> is t there will be at least one submatch and the first</br>
surrounds the matched alternative, and the regexp will also not match</br>
a prefix of any identifier.  Adorned regexps cannot be appended.  The</br>
language variable `c-nonsymbol-key' is used to make the adornment.</br>
</br>
A value 'appendable for <u>ADORN</u> is like above, but all alternatives in</br>
the list that end with a word constituent char will have \> appended</br>
instead, so that the regexp remains appendable.  Note that this</br>
variant doesn't always guarantee that an identifier prefix isn't</br>
matched since the symbol constituent '_' is normally considered a</br>
nonword token by \>.</br>
</br>
The optional <u>MODE</u> specifies the language to get `c-nonsymbol-key' from</br>
when it's needed.  The default is the current language taken from</br>
`c-buffer-is-cc-mode'.
