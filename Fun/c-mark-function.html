<strong>c-mark-function</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(c-mark-function)</br>
</br>
Put mark at end of the current top-level declaration or macro, point at beginning.</br>
If point is not inside any then the closest following one is</br>
chosen.  Each successive call of this command extends the marked</br>
region by one function.</br>
</br>
A mark is left where the command started, unless the region is already active</br>
(in Transient Mark mode).</br>
</br>
As opposed to M-x c-beginning-of-defun and M-x c-end-of-defun, this</br>
function does not require the declaration to contain a brace block.
