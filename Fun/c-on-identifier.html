<strong>c-on-identifier</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-on-identifier)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if the point is on or directly after an identifier.</br>
Keywords are recognized and not considered identifiers.  If an</br>
identifier is detected, the returned value is its starting position.</br>
If an identifier ends at the point and another begins at it (can only</br>
happen in Pike) then the point for the preceding one is returned.</br>

Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the</br>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
