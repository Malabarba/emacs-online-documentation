<strong>c-safe-scan-lists</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-safe-scan-lists FROM COUNT DEPTH &optional LIMIT)<br/>
<br/>
Like `scan-lists' but returns nil instead of signaling errors<br/>
for unbalanced parens.<br/>
<br/>
A limit for the search may be given.  FROM is assumed to be on the<br/>
right side of it.
