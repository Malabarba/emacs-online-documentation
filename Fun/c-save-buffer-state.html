<strong>c-save-buffer-state</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-save-buffer-state <u>VARLIST</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Bind variables according to <u>VARLIST</u> (in `let*' style) and eval <u>BODY</u>,</br>
then restore the buffer state under the assumption that no significant</br>
modification has been made in <u>BODY</u>.  A change is considered</br>
significant if it affects the buffer text in any way that isn't</br>
completely restored again.  Changes in text properties like `face' or</br>
`syntax-table' are considered insignificant.  This macro allows text</br>
properties to be changed, even in a read-only buffer.</br>
</br>
This macro should be placed around all calculations which set</br>
"insignificant" text properties in a buffer, even when the buffer is</br>
known to be writable.  That way, these text properties remain set</br>
even if the user undoes the command which set them.</br>
</br>
This macro should ALWAYS be placed around "temporary" internal buffer</br>
changes (like adding a newline to calculate a text-property then</br>
deleting it again), so that the user never sees them on his</br>
`buffer-undo-list'.  See also `c-tentative-buffer-changes'.</br>
</br>
However, any user-visible changes to the buffer (like auto-newlines)</br>
must not be within a `c-save-buffer-state', since the user then</br>
wouldn't be able to undo them.</br>
</br>
The return value is the value of the last form in <u>BODY</u>.
