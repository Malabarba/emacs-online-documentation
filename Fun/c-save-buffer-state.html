c-save-buffer-state is a Lisp macro in `cc-defs.el'.<br/><br/>(c-save-buffer-state VARLIST &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Bind variables according to VARLIST (in `let*' style) and eval BODY,<br/>then restore the buffer state under the assumption that no significant<br/>modification has been made in BODY.  A change is considered<br/>significant if it affects the buffer text in any way that isn't<br/>completely restored again.  Changes in text properties like `face' or<br/>`syntax-table' are considered insignificant.  This macro allows text<br/>properties to be changed, even in a read-only buffer.<br/><br/>This macro should be placed around all calculations which set<br/>"insignificant" text properties in a buffer, even when the buffer is<br/>known to be writable.  That way, these text properties remain set<br/>even if the user undoes the command which set them.<br/><br/>This macro should ALWAYS be placed around "temporary" internal buffer<br/>changes (like adding a newline to calculate a text-property then<br/>deleting it again), so that the user never sees them on his<br/>`buffer-undo-list'.  See also `c-tentative-buffer-changes'.<br/><br/>However, any user-visible changes to the buffer (like auto-newlines)<br/>must not be within a `c-save-buffer-state', since the user then<br/>wouldn't be able to undo them.<br/><br/>The return value is the value of the last form in BODY.
