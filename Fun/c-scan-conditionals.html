<strong>c-scan-conditionals</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-scan-conditionals <u>COUNT</u> &optional <u>TARGET-DEPTH</u> <u>WITH-ELSE</u>)</br>
</br>
Scan forward across <u>COUNT</u> preprocessor conditionals.</br>
With a negative argument, scan backward across preprocessor</br>
conditionals.  Return the end position.  Point is not moved.</br>
</br>
If there aren't enough preprocessor conditionals, throw an error.</br>
</br>
"#elif" is treated like "#else" followed by "#if", except that</br>
the nesting level isn't changed when tracking subconditionals.</br>
</br>
The optional argument <u>TARGET-DEPTH</u> specifies the wanted nesting depth</br>
after each scan.  E.g. if <u>TARGET-DEPTH</u> is -1, the end position will be</br>
outside the enclosing conditional.  A non-integer non-nil <u>TARGET-DEPTH</u></br>
counts as -1.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>WITH-ELSE</u> is non-nil, "#else" directives</br>
are treated as conditional clause limits.  Normally they are ignored.
