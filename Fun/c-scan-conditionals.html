<strong>c-scan-conditionals</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-scan-conditionals COUNT &optional TARGET-DEPTH WITH-ELSE)<br/>
<br/>
Scan forward across COUNT preprocessor conditionals.<br/>
With a negative argument, scan backward across preprocessor<br/>
conditionals.  Return the end position.  Point is not moved.<br/>
<br/>
If there aren't enough preprocessor conditionals, throw an error.<br/>
<br/>
"#elif" is treated like "#else" followed by "#if", except that<br/>
the nesting level isn't changed when tracking subconditionals.<br/>
<br/>
The optional argument TARGET-DEPTH specifies the wanted nesting depth<br/>
after each scan.  E.g. if TARGET-DEPTH is -1, the end position will be<br/>
outside the enclosing conditional.  A non-integer non-nil TARGET-DEPTH<br/>
counts as -1.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional argument WITH-ELSE is non-nil, "#else" directives<br/>
are treated as conditional clause limits.  Normally they are ignored.
