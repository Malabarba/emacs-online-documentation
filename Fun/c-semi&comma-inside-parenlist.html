c-semi&comma-inside-parenlist is a compiled Lisp function in `cc-align.el'.<br/><br/>(c-semi&comma-inside-parenlist)<br/><br/>Controls newline insertion after semicolons in parenthesis lists.<br/>If a comma was inserted, no determination is made.  If a semicolon was<br/>inserted inside a parenthesis list, no newline is added otherwise a<br/>newline is added.  In either case, checking is stopped.  This supports<br/>exactly the old newline insertion behavior.
