<strong>c-semi&comma-inside-parenlist</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-align.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-semi&comma-inside-parenlist)</br>
</br>
Controls newline insertion after semicolons in parenthesis lists.</br>
If a comma was inserted, no determination is made.  If a semicolon was</br>
inserted inside a parenthesis list, no newline is added otherwise a</br>
newline is added.  In either case, checking is stopped.  This supports</br>
exactly the old newline insertion behavior.
