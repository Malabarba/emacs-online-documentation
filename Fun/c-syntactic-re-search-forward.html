<strong>c-syntactic-re-search-forward</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-syntactic-re-search-forward REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR PAREN-LEVEL NOT-INSIDE-TOKEN LOOKBEHIND-SUBMATCH)<br/>
<br/>
Like `re-search-forward', but only report matches that are found<br/>
in syntactically significant text.  I.e. matches in comments, macros<br/>
or string literals are ignored.  The start point is assumed to be<br/>
outside any comment, macro or string literal, or else the content of<br/>
that region is taken as syntactically significant text.<br/>
<br/>
If PAREN-LEVEL is non-nil, an additional restriction is added to<br/>
ignore matches in nested paren sexps.  The search will also not go<br/>
outside the current list sexp, which has the effect that if the point<br/>
should be moved to BOUND when no match is found (i.e. NOERROR is<br/>
neither nil nor t), then it will be at the closing paren if the end of<br/>
the current list sexp is encountered first.<br/>
<br/>
If NOT-INSIDE-TOKEN is non-nil, matches in the middle of tokens are<br/>
ignored.  Things like multicharacter operators and special symbols<br/>
(e.g. "`()" in Pike) are handled but currently not floating point<br/>
constants.<br/>
<br/>
If LOOKBEHIND-SUBMATCH is non-nil, it's taken as a number of a<br/>
subexpression in REGEXP.  The end of that submatch is used as the<br/>
position to check for syntactic significance.  If LOOKBEHIND-SUBMATCH<br/>
isn't used or if that subexpression didn't match then the start<br/>
position of the whole match is used instead.  The "look behind"<br/>
subexpression is never tested before the starting position, so it<br/>
might be a good idea to include \= as a match alternative in it.<br/>
<br/>
Optimization note: Matches might be missed if the "look behind"<br/>
subexpression can match the end of nonwhite syntactic whitespace,<br/>
i.e. the end of comments or cpp directives.  This since the function<br/>
skips over such things before resuming the search.  It's on the other<br/>
hand not safe to assume that the "look behind" subexpression never<br/>
matches syntactic whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
Bug: Unbalanced parens inside cpp directives are currently not handled<br/>
correctly (i.e. they don't get ignored as they should) when<br/>
PAREN-LEVEL is set.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function might do hidden buffer changes.  See the<br/>
comment at the start of cc-engine.el for more info.
