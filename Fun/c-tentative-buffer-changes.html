<strong>c-tentative-buffer-changes</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(c-tentative-buffer-changes &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Eval <u>BODY</u> and optionally restore the buffer contents to the state it</br>
was in before <u>BODY</u>.  Any changes are kept if the last form in <u>BODY</u></br>
returns non-nil.  Otherwise it's undone using the undo facility, and</br>
various other buffer state that might be affected by the changes is</br>
restored.  That includes the current buffer, point, mark, mark</br>
activation (similar to `save-excursion'), and the modified state.</br>
The state is also restored if <u>BODY</u> exits nonlocally.</br>
</br>
If <u>BODY</u> makes a change that unconditionally is undone then wrap this</br>
macro inside `c-save-buffer-state'.  That way the change can be done</br>
even when the buffer is read-only, and without interference from</br>
various buffer change hooks.
