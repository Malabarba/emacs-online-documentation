<strong>c-toggle-syntactic-indentation</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cc-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(c-toggle-syntactic-indentation &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle syntactic indentation.<br/>
Optional numeric ARG, if supplied, turns on syntactic indentation when<br/>
positive, turns it off when negative, and just toggles it when zero or<br/>
left out.<br/>
<br/>
When syntactic indentation is turned on (the default), the indentation<br/>
functions and the electric keys indent according to the syntactic<br/>
context keys, when applicable.<br/>
<br/>
When it's turned off, the electric keys don't reindent, the indentation<br/>
functions indents every new line to the same level as the previous<br/>
nonempty line, and M-x c-indent-command adjusts the indentation in steps<br/>
specified by `c-basic-offset'.  The indentation style has no effect in<br/>
this mode, nor any of the indentation associated variables,<br/>
e.g. `c-special-indent-hook'.<br/>
<br/>
This command sets the variable `c-syntactic-indentation'.
