<br/>
(cal-tex-cursor-week &optional N EVENT)<br/>
<br/>
Make a one page LaTeX calendar for one week, showing hours of the day.<br/>
There are two columns; with 8-12am in the first and 1-5pm in the second.<br/>
It shows holidays if `cal-tex-holidays' is non-nil.<br/>
It does not show diary entries.<br/>
<br/>
The optional prefix argument N specifies a number of weeks (default 1).<br/>
<br/>
By default, the calendar is for the week at point; the optional<br/>
