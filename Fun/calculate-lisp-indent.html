<strong>calculate-lisp-indent</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>lisp-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(calculate-lisp-indent &optional <u>PARSE-START</u>)</br>
</br>
Return appropriate indentation for current line as Lisp code.</br>
In usual case returns an integer: the column to indent to.</br>
If the value is nil, that means don't change the indentation</br>
because the line starts inside a string.</br>
</br>
The value can also be a list of the form (COLUMN CONTAINING-SEXP-START).</br>
This means that following lines at the same level of indentation</br>
should not necessarily be indented the same as this line.</br>
Then COLUMN is the column to indent to, and CONTAINING-SEXP-START</br>
is the buffer position of the start of the containing expression.
