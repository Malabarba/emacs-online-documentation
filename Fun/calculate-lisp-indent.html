calculate-lisp-indent is a compiled Lisp function in `lisp-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(calculate-lisp-indent &optional PARSE-START)<br/><br/>Return appropriate indentation for current line as Lisp code.<br/>In usual case returns an integer: the column to indent to.<br/>If the value is nil, that means don't change the indentation<br/>because the line starts inside a string.<br/><br/>The value can also be a list of the form (COLUMN CONTAINING-SEXP-START).<br/>This means that following lines at the same level of indentation<br/>should not necessarily be indented the same as this line.<br/>Then COLUMN is the column to indent to, and CONTAINING-SEXP-START<br/>is the buffer position of the start of the containing expression.
