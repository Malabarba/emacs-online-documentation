(calendar-iso-from-absolute <u>DATE</u>)</br>
</br>
Compute the `ISO commercial date' corresponding to the absolute <u>DATE</u>.</br>
The ISO year corresponds approximately to the Gregorian year, but weeks</br>
start on Monday and end on Sunday.  The first week of the ISO year is the</br>
first such week in which at least 4 days are in a year.  The ISO commercial</br>
date has the form (week day year) in which week is in the range 1..52 and</br>
day is in the range 0..6 (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 0 = Sunday).  The</br>
absolute date is the number of days elapsed since the (imaginary) Gregorian</br>
date Sunday, December 31, 1 BC.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
