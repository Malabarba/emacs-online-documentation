(calendar-iso-from-absolute DATE)<br/>
<br/>
Compute the `ISO commercial date' corresponding to the absolute DATE.<br/>
The ISO year corresponds approximately to the Gregorian year, but weeks<br/>
start on Monday and end on Sunday.  The first week of the ISO year is the<br/>
first such week in which at least 4 days are in a year.  The ISO commercial<br/>
date has the form (week day year) in which week is in the range 1..52 and<br/>
day is in the range 0..6 (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 0 = Sunday).  The<br/>
absolute date is the number of days elapsed since the (imaginary) Gregorian<br/>
date Sunday, December 31, 1 BC.
