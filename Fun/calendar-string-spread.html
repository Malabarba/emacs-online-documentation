calendar-string-spread is a compiled Lisp function in `calendar.el'.<br/><br/>(calendar-string-spread STRINGS CHAR LENGTH)<br/><br/>Concatenate list of STRINGS separated with copies of CHAR to fill LENGTH.<br/>The effect is like mapconcat but the separating pieces are as balanced as<br/>possible.  Each item of STRINGS is evaluated before concatenation so it can<br/>actually be an expression that evaluates to a string.  If LENGTH is too short,<br/>the STRINGS are just concatenated and the result truncated.
