<strong>calendar</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>calendar.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <tools> <calendar>.<br/>
<br/>
(calendar &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Display a three-month Gregorian calendar.<br/>
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in<br/>
the middle surrounded by the previous and next months.  The<br/>
cursor is put on today's date.  If optional prefix argument ARG<br/>
is non-nil, prompts for the central month and year.<br/>
<br/>
Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved<br/>
into view.  Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar<br/>
can be scrolled forward or backward.  The cursor can be moved<br/>
forward or backward by one day, one week, one month, or one year.<br/>
All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,<br/>
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the<br/>
digit keys and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  Use<br/>
C-h m for details of the key bindings in the calendar<br/>
window.<br/>
<br/>
Displays the calendar in a separate window, or optionally in a<br/>
separate frame, depending on the value of `calendar-setup'.<br/>
<br/>
If `calendar-view-diary-initially-flag' is non-nil, also displays the<br/>
diary entries for the current date (or however many days<br/>
`diary-number-of-entries' specifies).  This variable can be<br/>
overridden by `calendar-setup'.  As well as being displayed,<br/>
diary entries can also be marked on the calendar (see<br/>
`calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag').<br/>
<br/>
Runs the following hooks:<br/>
<br/>
`calendar-load-hook' - after loading calendar.el<br/>
`calendar-today-visible-hook', `calendar-today-invisible-hook' - after<br/>
   generating a calendar, if today's date is visible or not, respectively<br/>
`calendar-initial-window-hook' - after first creating a calendar<br/>
<br/>
This function is suitable for execution in an init file.
