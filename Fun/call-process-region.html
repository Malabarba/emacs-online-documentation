<strong>call-process-region</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(call-process-region START END PROGRAM &optional DELETE BUFFER DISPLAY &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Send text from START to END to a synchronous process running PROGRAM.<br/>
The remaining arguments are optional.<br/>
Delete the text if fourth arg DELETE is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer; nil for<br/>
 BUFFER means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait; and `(:file<br/>
 FILE)', where FILE is a file name string, means that it should be<br/>
 written to that file (if the file already exists it is overwritten).<br/>
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,<br/>
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,<br/>
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.<br/>
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),<br/>
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.<br/>
<br/>
Sixth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.<br/>
Remaining args are passed to PROGRAM at startup as command args.<br/>
<br/>
If BUFFER is 0, `call-process-region' returns immediately with value nil.<br/>
Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate<br/>
and returns a numeric exit status or a signal description string.<br/>
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.
