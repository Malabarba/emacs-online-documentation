<strong>call-process-shell-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(call-process-shell-command COMMAND &optional INFILE BUFFER DISPLAY &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Execute the shell command COMMAND synchronously in separate process.<br/>
The remaining arguments are optional.<br/>
The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').<br/>
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer;<br/>
 nil for BUFFER means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait.<br/>
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,<br/>
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,<br/>
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.<br/>
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),<br/>
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.<br/>
Remaining arguments are strings passed as additional arguments for COMMAND.<br/>
Wildcards and redirection are handled as usual in the shell.<br/>
<br/>
If BUFFER is 0, `call-process-shell-command' returns immediately with value nil.<br/>
Otherwise it waits for COMMAND to terminate and returns a numeric exit<br/>
status or a signal description string.<br/>
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.
