call-process is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(call-process PROGRAM &optional INFILE BUFFER DISPLAY &rest ARGS)<br/><br/>Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.<br/>The remaining arguments are optional.<br/>The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').<br/>Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer; nil for BUFFER<br/> means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait; and `(:file FILE)', where<br/> FILE is a file name string, means that it should be written to that file<br/> (if the file already exists it is overwritten).<br/>BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,<br/>REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,<br/>while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.<br/>STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),<br/>t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.<br/><br/>Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.<br/>Remaining arguments are strings passed as command arguments to PROGRAM.<br/><br/>If executable PROGRAM can't be found as an executable, `call-process'<br/>signals a Lisp error.  `call-process' reports errors in execution of<br/>the program only through its return and output.<br/><br/>If BUFFER is 0, `call-process' returns immediately with value nil.<br/>Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate<br/>and returns a numeric exit status or a signal description string.<br/>If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.
