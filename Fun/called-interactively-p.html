<strong>called-interactively-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(called-interactively-p <u>KIND</u>)</br>
</br>
Return t if the containing function was called by `call-interactively'.</br>
If <u>KIND</u> is `interactive', then only return t if the call was made</br>
interactively by the user, i.e. not in `noninteractive' mode nor</br>
when `executing-kbd-macro'.</br>
If <u>KIND</u> is `any', on the other hand, it will return t for any kind of</br>
interactive call, including being called as the binding of a key or</br>
from a keyboard macro, even in `noninteractive' mode.</br>
</br>
This function is very brittle, it may fail to return the intended result when</br>
the code is debugged, advised, or instrumented in some form.  Some macros and</br>
special forms (such as `condition-case') may also sometimes wrap their bodies</br>
in a `lambda', so any call to `called-interactively-p' from those bodies will</br>
indicate whether that lambda (rather than the surrounding function) was called</br>
interactively.</br>
</br>
Instead of using this function, it is cleaner and more reliable to give your</br>
function an extra optional argument whose `interactive' spec specifies</br>
non-nil unconditionally ("p" is a good way to do this), or via</br>
(not (or executing-kbd-macro noninteractive)).</br>
</br>
The only known proper use of `interactive' for <u>KIND</u> is in deciding</br>
whether to display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're</br>
thinking of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that</br>
you're making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the</br>
command is called from a keyboard macro?
