<strong>called-interactively-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(called-interactively-p KIND)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if the containing function was called by `call-interactively'.<br/>
If KIND is `interactive', then only return t if the call was made<br/>
interactively by the user, i.e. not in `noninteractive' mode nor<br/>
when `executing-kbd-macro'.<br/>
If KIND is `any', on the other hand, it will return t for any kind of<br/>
interactive call, including being called as the binding of a key, or<br/>
from a keyboard macro, or in `noninteractive' mode.<br/>
<br/>
The only known proper use of `interactive' for KIND is in deciding<br/>
whether to display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're<br/>
thinking of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that<br/>
you're making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the<br/>
command is called from a keyboard macro?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of using this function, it is sometimes cleaner to give your<br/>
function an extra optional argument whose `interactive' spec specifies<br/>
non-nil unconditionally ("p" is a good way to do this), or via<br/>
(not (or executing-kbd-macro noninteractive)).
