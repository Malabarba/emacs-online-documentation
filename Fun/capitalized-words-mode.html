<strong>capitalized-words-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>cap-words.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(capitalized-words-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle Capitalized Words mode.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable Capitalized Words mode if <u>ARG</u></br>
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,</br>
enable the mode if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.</br>
</br>
Capitalized Words mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When</br>
enabled, a word boundary occurs immediately before an uppercase</br>
letter in a symbol.  This is in addition to all the normal</br>
boundaries given by the syntax and category tables.  There is no</br>
restriction to ASCII.</br>
</br>
E.g. the beginning of words in the following identifier are as marked:</br>
</br>
  capitalizedWorDD</br>
  ^          ^  ^^</br>
</br>
Note that these word boundaries only apply for word motion and</br>
marking commands such as M-f.  This mode does not affect word</br>
boundaries found by regexp matching (`\>', `\w' &c).</br>
</br>
This style of identifiers is common in environments like Java ones,</br>
where underscores aren't trendy enough.  Capitalization rules are</br>
sometimes part of the language, e.g. Haskell, which may thus encourage</br>
such a style.  It is appropriate to add `capitalized-words-mode' to</br>
the mode hook for programming language modes in which you encounter</br>
variables like this, e.g. `java-mode-hook'.  It's unlikely to cause</br>
trouble if such identifiers aren't used.</br>
