<strong>case</strong> is an alias for `cl-case' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(case EXPR (KEYLIST BODY...)...)<br/>
<br/>
Eval EXPR and choose among clauses on that value.<br/>
Each clause looks like (KEYLIST BODY...).  EXPR is evaluated and compared<br/>
against each key in each KEYLIST; the corresponding BODY is evaluated.<br/>
If no clause succeeds, cl-case returns nil.  A single atom may be used in<br/>
place of a KEYLIST of one atom.  A KEYLIST of t or `otherwise' is<br/>
allowed only in the final clause, and matches if no other keys match.<br/>
Key values are compared by `eql'.
