<strong>cc-eval-when-compile</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cc-eval-when-compile &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `progn', but evaluates the body at compile time.</br>
The result of the body appears to the compiler as a quoted constant.</br>
</br>
This variant works around bugs in `eval-when-compile' in various</br>
(X)Emacs versions.  See cc-defs.el for details.
