<strong>ccl-execute-on-string</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ccl-execute-on-string CCL-PROGRAM STATUS STRING &optional CONTINUE UNIBYTE-P)<br/>
<br/>
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with initial STATUS on STRING.<br/>
<br/>
CCL-PROGRAM is a symbol registered by `register-ccl-program',<br/>
or a compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility,<br/>
in this case, the execution is slower).<br/>
<br/>
Read buffer is set to STRING, and write buffer is allocated automatically.<br/>
<br/>
STATUS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7 IC], where<br/>
 R0..R7 are initial values of corresponding registers,<br/>
 IC is the instruction counter specifying from where to start the program.<br/>
If R0..R7 are nil, they are initialized to 0.<br/>
If IC is nil, it is initialized to head of the CCL program.<br/>
<br/>
If optional 4th arg CONTINUE is non-nil, keep IC on read operation<br/>
when read buffer is exhausted, else, IC is always set to the end of<br/>
CCL-PROGRAM on exit.<br/>
<br/>
It returns the contents of write buffer as a string,<br/>
 and as side effect, STATUS is updated.<br/>
If the optional 5th arg UNIBYTE-P is non-nil, the returned string<br/>
is a unibyte string.  By default it is a multibyte string.<br/>
<br/>
See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for the detail of CCL program.
