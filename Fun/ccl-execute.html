<strong>ccl-execute</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ccl-execute CCL-PROG REG)<br/>
<br/>
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with registers initialized by REGISTERS.<br/>
<br/>
CCL-PROGRAM is a CCL program name (symbol)<br/>
or compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility.<br/>
In the latter case, the execution overhead is bigger than in the former).<br/>
No I/O commands should appear in CCL-PROGRAM.<br/>
<br/>
REGISTERS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7] where RN is an initial value<br/>
for the Nth register.<br/>
<br/>
As side effect, each element of REGISTERS holds the value of<br/>
the corresponding register after the execution.<br/>
<br/>
See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for a definition of CCL<br/>
programs.
