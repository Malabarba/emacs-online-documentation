<strong>cconv-convert</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cconv.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cconv-convert <u>FORM</u> <u>ENV</u> <u>EXTEND</u>)</br>
</br>
Return <u>FORM</u> with all its lambdas changed so they are closed.</br>
<u>ENV</u> is a lexical environment mapping variables to the expression</br>
used to get its value.  This is used for variables that are copied into</br>
closures, moved into cons cells, ...</br>
<u>ENV</u> is a list where each entry takes the shape either:</br>
 (VAR . (car-safe EXP)): VAR has been moved into the car of a cons-cell, and EXP</br>
    is an expression that evaluates to this cons-cell.</br>
 (VAR . (internal-get-closed-var N)): VAR has been copied into the closure</br>
    environment's Nth slot.</br>
 (VAR . (apply-partially F ARG1 ARG2 ..)): VAR has been Î»-lifted and takes</br>
    additional arguments ARGs.</br>
<u>EXTEND</u> is a list of variables which might need to be accessed even from places</br>
where they are shadowed, because some part of <u>ENV</u> causes them to be used at</br>
places where they originally did not directly appear.
