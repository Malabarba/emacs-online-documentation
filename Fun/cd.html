</br>
</br>
(cd <u>DIR</u>)</br>
</br>
Make <u>DIR</u> become the current buffer's default directory.</br>
If your environment includes a `CDPATH' variable, try each one of</br>
that list of directories (separated by occurrences of</br>
`path-separator') when resolving a relative directory name.</br>
The path separator is colon in GNU and GNU-like systems.
