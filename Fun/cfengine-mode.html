<strong>cfengine-mode</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/cfengine3-mode.html">cfengine3-mode</a></strong>' in `<code>cfengine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(cfengine-mode)</br>
</br>
Major mode for editing CFEngine3 input.</br>
There are no special keybindings by default.</br>
</br>
Action blocks are treated as defuns, i.e. C-M-a moves</br>
to the action header.</br>
</br>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `prog-mode' might have run,</br>
this mode runs the hook `cfengine3-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.
