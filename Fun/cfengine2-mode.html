<strong>cfengine2-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>cfengine.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(cfengine2-mode)</br>
</br>
Parent mode: `prog-mode'.</br>
</br>
Major mode for editing CFEngine2 input.</br>
There are no special keybindings by default.</br>
</br>
Action blocks are treated as defuns, i.e. C-M-a moves</br>
to the action header.</br>
</br>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `prog-mode' might have run,</br>
this mode runs the hook `cfengine2-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.
