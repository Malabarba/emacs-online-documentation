<strong>change-log-merge</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>add-log.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(change-log-merge OTHER-LOG)<br/>
<br/>
Merge the contents of change log file OTHER-LOG with this buffer.<br/>
Both must be found in Change Log mode (since the merging depends on<br/>
the appropriate motion commands).  OTHER-LOG can be either a file name<br/>
or a buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Entries are inserted in chronological order.  Both the current and<br/>
old-style time formats for entries are supported.
