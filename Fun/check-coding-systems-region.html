<strong>check-coding-systems-region</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(check-coding-systems-region START END CODING-SYSTEM-LIST)<br/>
<br/>
Check if the region is encodable by coding systems.<br/>
<br/>
START and END are buffer positions specifying the region.<br/>
CODING-SYSTEM-LIST is a list of coding systems to check.<br/>
<br/>
The value is an alist ((CODING-SYSTEM POS0 POS1 ...) ...), where<br/>
CODING-SYSTEM is a member of CODING-SYSTEM-LIST and can't encode the<br/>
whole region, POS0, POS1, ... are buffer positions where non-encodable<br/>
characters are found.<br/>
<br/>
If all coding systems in CODING-SYSTEM-LIST can encode the region, the<br/>
value is nil.<br/>
<br/>
START may be a string.  In that case, check if the string is<br/>
encodable, and the value contains indices to the string instead of<br/>
buffer positions.  END is ignored.<br/>
<br/>
If the current buffer (or START if it is a string) is unibyte, the value<br/>
is nil.
