<strong>check-declare-scan</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>check-declare.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(check-declare-scan <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Scan <u>FILE</u> for `declare-function' calls.</br>
Return a list with elements of the form (FNFILE FN ARGLIST FILEONLY),</br>
where only the first two elements need be present.  This claims that FNFILE</br>
defines FN, with ARGLIST.  FILEONLY non-nil means only check that FNFILE</br>
exists, not that it defines FN.  This is for function definitions that we</br>
don't know how to recognize (e.g. some macros).
