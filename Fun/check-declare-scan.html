<strong>check-declare-scan</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>check-declare.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(check-declare-scan FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Scan FILE for `declare-function' calls.<br/>
Return a list with elements of the form (FNFILE FN ARGLIST FILEONLY),<br/>
where only the first two elements need be present.  This claims that FNFILE<br/>
defines FN, with ARGLIST.  FILEONLY non-nil means only check that FNFILE<br/>
exists, not that it defines FN.  This is for function definitions that we<br/>
don't know how to recognize (e.g. some macros).
