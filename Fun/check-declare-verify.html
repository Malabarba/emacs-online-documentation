<strong>check-declare-verify</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>check-declare.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(check-declare-verify <u>FNFILE</u> <u>FNLIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Check that <u>FNFILE</u> contains function definitions matching <u>FNLIST</u>.</br>
Each element of <u>FNLIST</u> has the form (FILE FN ARGLIST FILEONLY), where</br>
only the first two elements need be present.  This means FILE claimed FN</br>
was defined in <u>FNFILE</u> with the specified ARGLIST.  FILEONLY non-nil means</br>
to only check that <u>FNFILE</u> exists, not that it actually defines FN.</br>
</br>
Returns nil if all claims are found to be true, otherwise a list</br>
of errors with elements of the form (FILE FN TYPE), where TYPE</br>
is a string giving details of the error.
