<strong>check-declare-verify</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>check-declare.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(check-declare-verify FNFILE FNLIST)<br/>
<br/>
Check that FNFILE contains function definitions matching FNLIST.<br/>
Each element of FNLIST has the form (FILE FN ARGLIST FILEONLY), where<br/>
only the first two elements need be present.  This means FILE claimed FN<br/>
was defined in FNFILE with the specified ARGLIST.  FILEONLY non-nil means<br/>
to only check that FNFILE exists, not that it actually defines FN.<br/>
<br/>
Returns nil if all claims are found to be true, otherwise a list<br/>
of errors with elements of the form (FILE FN TYPE), where TYPE<br/>
is a string giving details of the error.
