(check-parens)</br>
</br>
Check for unbalanced parentheses in the current buffer.</br>
More accurately, check the narrowed part of the buffer for unbalanced</br>
expressions ("sexps") in general.  This is done according to the</br>
current syntax table and will find unbalanced brackets or quotes as</br>
appropriate.  (See Info node `(emacs)Parentheses'.)  If imbalance is</br>
found, an error is signaled and point is left at the first unbalanced</br>
character.
