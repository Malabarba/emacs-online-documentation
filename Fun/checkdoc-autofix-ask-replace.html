<strong>checkdoc-autofix-ask-replace</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>checkdoc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(checkdoc-autofix-ask-replace START END QUESTION REPLACEWITH &optional COMPLEX)<br/>
<br/>
Highlight between START and END and queries the user with QUESTION.<br/>
If the user says yes, or if `checkdoc-autofix-flag' permits, replace<br/>
the region marked by START and END with REPLACEWITH.  If optional flag<br/>
COMPLEX is non-nil, then we may ask the user a question.  See the<br/>
documentation for `checkdoc-autofix-flag' for details.<br/>
<br/>
If a section is auto-replaced without asking the user, this function<br/>
will pause near the fixed code so the user will briefly see what<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
This function returns non-nil if the text was replaced.<br/>
<br/>
This function will not modify `match-data'.
