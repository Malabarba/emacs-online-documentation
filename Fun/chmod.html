<strong>chmod</strong> is an alias for `set-file-modes' in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(chmod FILENAME MODE)<br/>
<br/>
Set mode bits of file named FILENAME to MODE (an integer).<br/>
Only the 12 low bits of MODE are used.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, mode bits are read by `read-file-modes', which accepts<br/>
symbolic notation, like the `chmod' command from GNU Coreutils.
