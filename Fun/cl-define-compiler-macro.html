<strong>cl-define-compiler-macro</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>cl-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cl-define-compiler-macro <u>FUNC</u> <u>ARGS</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Define a compiler-only macro.</br>
This is like `defmacro', but macro expansion occurs only if the call to</br>
<u>FUNC</u> is compiled (i.e., not interpreted).  Compiler macros should be used</br>
for optimizing the way calls to <u>FUNC</u> are compiled; the form returned by</br>
<u>BODY</u> should do the same thing as a call to the normal function called</br>
<u>FUNC</u>, though possibly more efficiently.  Note that, like regular macros,</br>
compiler macros are expanded repeatedly until no further expansions are</br>
possible.  Unlike regular macros, <u>BODY</u> can decide to "punt" and leave the</br>
original function call alone by declaring an initial `&whole foo' parameter</br>
and then returning foo.
