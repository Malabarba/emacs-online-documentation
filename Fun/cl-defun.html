<strong>cl-defun</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>cl-macs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cl-defun NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...)<br/>
<br/>
Define NAME as a function.<br/>
Like normal `defun', except ARGLIST allows full Common Lisp conventions,<br/>
and BODY is implicitly surrounded by (cl-block NAME ...).
