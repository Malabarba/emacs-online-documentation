<strong>cl-letf</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>cl-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cl-letf ((<u>PLACE</u> <u>VALUE</u>) ...) <u>BODY</u>...)</br>
</br>
Temporarily bind to <u>PLACE</u>s.</br>
This is the analogue of `let', but with generalized variables (in the</br>
sense of `setf') for the <u>PLACE</u>s.  Each <u>PLACE</u> is set to the corresponding</br>
<u>VALUE</u>, then the <u>BODY</u> forms are executed.  On exit, either normally or</br>
because of a `throw' or error, the <u>PLACE</u>s are set back to their original</br>
values.  Note that this macro is *not* available in Common Lisp.</br>
As a special case, if `(<u>PLACE</u>)' is used instead of `(<u>PLACE</u> <u>VALUE</u>)',</br>
the <u>PLACE</u> is not modified before executing <u>BODY</u>.
