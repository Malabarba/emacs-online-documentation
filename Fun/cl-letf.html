cl-letf is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `cl-macs.el'.<br/><br/>(cl-letf ((PLACE VALUE) ...) BODY...)<br/><br/>Temporarily bind to PLACEs.<br/>This is the analogue of `let', but with generalized variables (in the<br/>sense of `setf') for the PLACEs.  Each PLACE is set to the corresponding<br/>VALUE, then the BODY forms are executed.  On exit, either normally or<br/>because of a `throw' or error, the PLACEs are set back to their original<br/>values.  Note that this macro is *not* available in Common Lisp.<br/>As a special case, if `(PLACE)' is used instead of `(PLACE VALUE)',<br/>the PLACE is not modified before executing BODY.
