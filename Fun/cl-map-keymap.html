<strong>cl-map-keymap</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="map-keymap">map-keymap</a></strong>' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cl-map-keymap <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>KEYMAP</u>)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 24.3;</br>
use `map-keymap' instead.</br>
</br>
Call <u>FUNCTION</u> once for each event binding in <u>KEYMAP</u>.</br>
<u>FUNCTION</u> is called with two arguments: the event that is bound, and</br>
the definition it is bound to.  The event may be a character range.</br>
</br>
If <u>KEYMAP</u> has a parent, the parent's bindings are included as well.</br>
This works recursively: if the parent has itself a parent, then the</br>
grandparent's bindings are also included and so on.
