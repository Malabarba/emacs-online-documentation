<strong>cl-map-keymap</strong> is an alias for `map-keymap' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cl-map-keymap FUNCTION KEYMAP)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 24.3;<br/>
use `map-keymap' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Call FUNCTION once for each event binding in KEYMAP.<br/>
FUNCTION is called with two arguments: the event that is bound, and<br/>
the definition it is bound to.  The event may be a character range.<br/>
<br/>
If KEYMAP has a parent, the parent's bindings are included as well.<br/>
This works recursively: if the parent has itself a parent, then the<br/>
grandparent's bindings are also included and so on.
