<strong>cl-mapcar</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cl-lib.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cl-mapcar <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>SEQ</u>...)</br>
</br>
Apply <u>FUNCTION</u> to each element of <u>SEQ</u>, and make a list of the results.</br>
If there are several <u>SEQ</u>s, <u>FUNCTION</u> is called with that many arguments,</br>
and mapping stops as soon as the shortest list runs out.  With just one</br>
<u>SEQ</u>, this is like `mapcar'.  With several, it is like the Common Lisp</br>
`mapcar' function extended to arbitrary sequence types.
