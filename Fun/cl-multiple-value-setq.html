<strong>cl-multiple-value-setq</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>cl-macs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cl-multiple-value-setq (SYM...) FORM)<br/>
<br/>
Collect multiple return values.<br/>
FORM must return a list; the first N elements of this list are stored in<br/>
each of the symbols SYM in turn.  This is analogous to the Common Lisp<br/>
`cl-multiple-value-setq' macro, using lists to simulate true multiple return<br/>
values.  For compatibility, (cl-values A B C) is a synonym for (list A B C).
