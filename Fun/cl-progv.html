cl-progv is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `cl-macs.el'.<br/><br/>(cl-progv SYMBOLS VALUES &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Bind SYMBOLS to VALUES dynamically in BODY.<br/>The forms SYMBOLS and VALUES are evaluated, and must evaluate to lists.<br/>Each symbol in the first list is bound to the corresponding value in the<br/>second list (or to nil if VALUES is shorter than SYMBOLS); then the<br/>BODY forms are executed and their result is returned.  This is much like<br/>a `let' form, except that the list of symbols can be computed at run-time.
