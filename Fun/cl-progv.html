<strong>cl-progv</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>cl-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cl-progv <u>SYMBOLS</u> <u>VALUES</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Bind <u>SYMBOLS</u> to <u>VALUES</u> dynamically in <u>BODY</u>.</br>
The forms <u>SYMBOLS</u> and <u>VALUES</u> are evaluated, and must evaluate to lists.</br>
Each symbol in the first list is bound to the corresponding value in the</br>
second list (or to nil if <u>VALUES</u> is shorter than <u>SYMBOLS</u>); then the</br>
<u>BODY</u> forms are executed and their result is returned.  This is much like</br>
a `let' form, except that the list of symbols can be computed at run-time.
