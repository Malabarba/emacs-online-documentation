<strong>cl-return-from</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>cl-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cl-return-from <u>NAME</u> &optional <u>RESULT</u>)</br>
</br>
Return from the block named <u>NAME</u>.</br>
This jumps out to the innermost enclosing `(cl-block <u>NAME</u> ...)' form,</br>
returning <u>RESULT</u> from that form (or nil if <u>RESULT</u> is omitted).</br>
This is compatible with Common Lisp, but note that `defun' and</br>
`defmacro' do not create implicit blocks as they do in Common Lisp.
