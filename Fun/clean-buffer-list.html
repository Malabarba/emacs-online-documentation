clean-buffer-list is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `midnight.el'.<br/><br/>(clean-buffer-list)<br/><br/>Kill old buffers that have not been displayed recently.<br/>The relevant variables are `clean-buffer-list-delay-general',<br/>`clean-buffer-list-delay-special', `clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names',<br/>`clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names',<br/>`clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps' and<br/>`clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps'.<br/>While processing buffers, this procedure displays messages containing<br/>the current date/time, buffer name, how many seconds ago it was<br/>displayed (can be nil if the buffer was never displayed) and its<br/>lifetime, i.e., its "age" when it will be purged.
