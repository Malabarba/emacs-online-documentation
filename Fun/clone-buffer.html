<strong>clone-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(clone-buffer &optional <u>NEWNAME</u> <u>DISPLAY-FLAG</u>)</br>
</br>
Create and return a twin copy of the current buffer.</br>
Unlike an indirect buffer, the new buffer can be edited</br>
independently of the old one (if it is not read-only).</br>
<u>NEWNAME</u> is the name of the new buffer.  It may be modified by</br>
adding or incrementing &lt;N> at the end as necessary to create a</br>
unique buffer name.  If nil, it defaults to the name of the</br>
current buffer, with the proper suffix.  If <u>DISPLAY-FLAG</u> is</br>
non-nil, the new buffer is shown with `pop-to-buffer'.  Trying to</br>
clone a file-visiting buffer, or a buffer whose major mode symbol</br>
has a non-nil `no-clone' property, results in an error.</br>
</br>
Interactively, <u>DISPLAY-FLAG</u> is t and <u>NEWNAME</u> is the name of the</br>
current buffer with appropriate suffix.  However, if a prefix</br>
argument is given, then the command prompts for <u>NEWNAME</u> in the</br>
minibuffer.</br>
</br>
This runs the normal hook `clone-buffer-hook' in the new buffer</br>
after it has been set up properly in other respects.
