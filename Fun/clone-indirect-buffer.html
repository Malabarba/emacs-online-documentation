<strong>clone-indirect-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(clone-indirect-buffer NEWNAME DISPLAY-FLAG &optional NORECORD)<br/>
<br/>
Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Give the indirect buffer name NEWNAME.  Interactively, read NEWNAME<br/>
from the minibuffer when invoked with a prefix arg.  If NEWNAME is nil<br/>
or if not called with a prefix arg, NEWNAME defaults to the current<br/>
buffer's name.  The name is modified by adding a `<N>' suffix to it<br/>
or by incrementing the N in an existing suffix.  Trying to clone a<br/>
buffer whose major mode symbol has a non-nil `no-clone-indirect'<br/>
property results in an error.<br/>
<br/>
DISPLAY-FLAG non-nil means show the new buffer with `pop-to-buffer'.<br/>
This is always done when called interactively.<br/>
<br/>
Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at the<br/>
front of the list of recently selected ones.
