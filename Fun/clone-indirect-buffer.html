<strong>clone-indirect-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(clone-indirect-buffer <u>NEWNAME</u> <u>DISPLAY-FLAG</u> &optional <u>NORECORD</u>)</br>
</br>
Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer.</br>
</br>
Give the indirect buffer name <u>NEWNAME</u>.  Interactively, read <u>NEWNAME</u></br>
from the minibuffer when invoked with a prefix arg.  If <u>NEWNAME</u> is nil</br>
or if not called with a prefix arg, <u>NEWNAME</u> defaults to the current</br>
buffer's name.  The name is modified by adding a `&lt;N>' suffix to it</br>
or by incrementing the N in an existing suffix.  Trying to clone a</br>
buffer whose major mode symbol has a non-nil `no-clone-indirect'</br>
property results in an error.</br>
</br>
<u>DISPLAY-FLAG</u> non-nil means show the new buffer with `pop-to-buffer'.</br>
This is always done when called interactively.</br>
</br>
Optional third arg <u>NORECORD</u> non-nil means do not put this buffer at the</br>
front of the list of recently selected ones.
