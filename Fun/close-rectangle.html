<strong>close-rectangle</strong> is an alias for `delete-whitespace-rectangle' in `<code>rect.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(close-rectangle START END &optional FILL)<br/>
<br/>
Delete all whitespace following a specified column in each line.<br/>
The left edge of the rectangle specifies the position in each line<br/>
at which whitespace deletion should begin.  On each line in the<br/>
rectangle, all continuous whitespace starting at that column is deleted.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a program the rectangle's corners are START and END.<br/>
With a prefix (or a FILL) argument, also fill too short lines.
