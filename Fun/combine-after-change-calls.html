<strong>combine-after-change-calls</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(combine-after-change-calls &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute <u>BODY</u>, but don't call the after-change functions till the end.</br>
If <u>BODY</u> makes changes in the buffer, they are recorded</br>
and the functions on `after-change-functions' are called several times</br>
when <u>BODY</u> is finished.</br>
The return value is the value of the last form in <u>BODY</u>.</br>
</br>
If `before-change-functions' is non-nil, then calls to the after-change</br>
functions can't be deferred, so in that case this macro has no effect.</br>
</br>
Do not alter `after-change-functions' or `before-change-functions'</br>
in <u>BODY</u>.
