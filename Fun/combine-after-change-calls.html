combine-after-change-calls is a Lisp macro in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(combine-after-change-calls &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Execute BODY, but don't call the after-change functions till the end.<br/>If BODY makes changes in the buffer, they are recorded<br/>and the functions on `after-change-functions' are called several times<br/>when BODY is finished.<br/>The return value is the value of the last form in BODY.<br/><br/>If `before-change-functions' is non-nil, then calls to the after-change<br/>functions can't be deferred, so in that case this macro has no effect.<br/><br/>Do not alter `after-change-functions' or `before-change-functions'<br/>in BODY.
