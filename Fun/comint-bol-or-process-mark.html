comint-bol-or-process-mark is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `comint.el'.<br/><br/>(comint-bol-or-process-mark)<br/><br/>Move point to beginning of line (after prompt) or to the process mark.<br/>The first time you use this command, it moves to the beginning of the line<br/>(but after the prompt, if any).  If you repeat it again immediately,<br/>it moves point to the process mark.<br/><br/>The process mark separates the process output, along with input already sent,<br/>from input that has not yet been sent.  Ordinarily, the process mark<br/>is at the beginning of the current input line; but if you have<br/>used M-x comint-accumulate to send multiple lines at once,<br/>the process mark is at the beginning of the accumulated input.
