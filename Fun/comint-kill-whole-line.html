comint-kill-whole-line is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `comint.el'.<br/><br/>(comint-kill-whole-line &optional COUNT)<br/><br/>Kill current line, ignoring read-only and field properties.<br/>With prefix arg COUNT, kill that many lines starting from the current line.<br/>If COUNT is negative, kill backward.  Also kill the preceding newline,<br/>instead of the trailing one.  (This is meant to make C-x z work well<br/>with negative arguments.)<br/>If COUNT is zero, kill current line but exclude the trailing newline.<br/>The read-only status of newlines is updated with `comint-update-fence',<br/>if necessary.
