<strong>comint-read-input-ring</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>comint.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(comint-read-input-ring &optional SILENT)<br/>
<br/>
Set the buffer's `comint-input-ring' from a history file.<br/>
The name of the file is given by the variable `comint-input-ring-file-name'.<br/>
The history ring is of size `comint-input-ring-size', regardless of file size.<br/>
If `comint-input-ring-file-name' is nil this function does nothing.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional argument SILENT is non-nil, we say nothing about a<br/>
failure to read the history file.<br/>
<br/>
This function is useful for major mode commands and mode hooks.<br/>
<br/>
The commands stored in the history file are separated by the<br/>
`comint-input-ring-separator', and entries that match<br/>
`comint-input-history-ignore' are ignored.  The most recent command<br/>
comes last.<br/>
<br/>
