<strong>comint-stop-subjob</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>comint.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(comint-stop-subjob)</br>
</br>
Stop the current subjob.</br>
This command also kills the pending input</br>
between the process mark and point.</br>
</br>
WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending</br>
the top-level process running in the buffer.  If you accidentally do</br>
this, use M-x comint-continue-subjob to resume the process.  (This</br>
is not a problem with most shells, since they ignore this signal.)
