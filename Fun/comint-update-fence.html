comint-update-fence is a compiled Lisp function in `comint.el'.<br/><br/>(comint-update-fence)<br/><br/>Update read-only status of newline before point.<br/>The `fence' read-only property is used to indicate that a newline<br/>is read-only for no other reason than to "fence off" a<br/>following front-sticky read-only region.  This is used to<br/>implement comint read-only prompts.  If the text after a newline<br/>changes, the read-only status of that newline may need updating.<br/>That is what this function does.<br/><br/>This function does nothing if point is not at the beginning of a<br/>line, or is at the beginning of the accessible portion of the buffer.<br/>Otherwise, if the character after point has a front-sticky<br/>read-only property, then the preceding newline is given a<br/>read-only property of `fence', unless it already is read-only.<br/>If the character after point does not have a front-sticky<br/>read-only property, any read-only property of `fence' on the<br/>preceding newline is removed.
