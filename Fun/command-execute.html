<strong>command-execute</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(command-execute CMD &optional RECORD-FLAG KEYS SPECIAL)<br/>
<br/>
Execute CMD as an editor command.<br/>
CMD must be a symbol that satisfies the `commandp' predicate.<br/>
Optional second arg RECORD-FLAG non-nil<br/>
means unconditionally put this command in `command-history'.<br/>
Otherwise, that is done only if an arg is read using the minibuffer.<br/>
The argument KEYS specifies the value to use instead of (this-command-keys)<br/>
when reading the arguments; if it is nil, (this-command-keys) is used.<br/>
The argument SPECIAL, if non-nil, means that this command is executing<br/>
a special event, so ignore the prefix argument and don't clear it.
