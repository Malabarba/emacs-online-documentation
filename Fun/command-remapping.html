<strong>command-remapping</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(command-remapping <u>COMMAND</u> &optional <u>POSITION</u> <u>KEYMAPS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the remapping for command <u>COMMAND</u>.</br>
Returns nil if <u>COMMAND</u> is not remapped (or not a symbol).</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>POSITION</u> is non-nil, it specifies a mouse</br>
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the</br>
remapping occurs in the keymaps associated with it.  It can also be a</br>
number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the specified</br>
buffer position instead of point are used.  The <u>KEYMAPS</u> argument is</br>
ignored if <u>POSITION</u> is non-nil.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>KEYMAPS</u> is non-nil, it should be a list of</br>
keymaps to search for command remapping.  Otherwise, search for the</br>
remapping in all currently active keymaps.
