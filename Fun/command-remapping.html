<strong>command-remapping</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(command-remapping COMMAND &optional POSITION KEYMAPS)<br/>
<br/>
Return the remapping for command COMMAND.<br/>
Returns nil if COMMAND is not remapped (or not a symbol).<br/>
<br/>
If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse<br/>
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the<br/>
remapping occurs in the keymaps associated with it.  It can also be a<br/>
number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the specified<br/>
buffer position instead of point are used.  The KEYMAPS argument is<br/>
ignored if POSITION is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional argument KEYMAPS is non-nil, it should be a list of<br/>
keymaps to search for command remapping.  Otherwise, search for the<br/>
remapping in all currently active keymaps.
