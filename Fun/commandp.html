<strong>commandp</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(commandp <u>FUNCTION</u> &optional <u>FOR-CALL-INTERACTIVELY</u>)</br>
</br>
Non-nil if <u>FUNCTION</u> makes provisions for interactive calling.</br>
This means it contains a description for how to read arguments to give it.</br>
The value is nil for an invalid function or a symbol with no function</br>
definition.</br>
</br>
Interactively callable functions include strings and vectors (treated</br>
as keyboard macros), lambda-expressions that contain a top-level call</br>
to `interactive', autoload definitions made by `autoload' with non-nil</br>
fourth argument, and some of the built-in functions of Lisp.</br>
</br>
Also, a symbol satisfies `commandp' if its function definition does so.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>FOR-CALL-INTERACTIVELY</u> is non-nil,</br>
then strings and vectors are not accepted.
