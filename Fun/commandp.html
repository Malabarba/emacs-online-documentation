<strong>commandp</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(commandp FUNCTION &optional FOR-CALL-INTERACTIVELY)<br/>
<br/>
Non-nil if FUNCTION makes provisions for interactive calling.<br/>
This means it contains a description for how to read arguments to give it.<br/>
The value is nil for an invalid function or a symbol with no function<br/>
definition.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively callable functions include strings and vectors (treated<br/>
as keyboard macros), lambda-expressions that contain a top-level call<br/>
to `interactive', autoload definitions made by `autoload' with non-nil<br/>
fourth argument, and some of the built-in functions of Lisp.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a symbol satisfies `commandp' if its function definition does so.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional argument FOR-CALL-INTERACTIVELY is non-nil,<br/>
then strings and vectors are not accepted.
