<strong>comment-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(comment-region BEG END &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Comment or uncomment each line in the region.<br/>
With just C-u prefix arg, uncomment each line in region BEG .. END.<br/>
Numeric prefix ARG means use ARG comment characters.<br/>
If ARG is negative, delete that many comment characters instead.<br/>
<br/>
The strings used as comment starts are built from `comment-start'<br/>
and `comment-padding'; the strings used as comment ends are built<br/>
from `comment-end' and `comment-padding'.<br/>
<br/>
By default, the `comment-start' markers are inserted at the<br/>
current indentation of the region, and comments are terminated on<br/>
each line (even for syntaxes in which newline does not end the<br/>
comment and blank lines do not get comments).  This can be<br/>
changed with `comment-style'.
