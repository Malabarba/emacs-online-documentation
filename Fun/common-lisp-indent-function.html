<strong>common-lisp-indent-function</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>cl-indent.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(common-lisp-indent-function INDENT-POINT STATE)<br/>
<br/>
Function to indent the arguments of a Lisp function call.<br/>
This is suitable for use as the value of the variable<br/>
`lisp-indent-function'.  INDENT-POINT is the point at which the<br/>
indentation function is called, and STATE is the<br/>
`parse-partial-sexp' state at that position.  Browse the<br/>
`lisp-indent' customize group for options affecting the behavior<br/>
of this function.<br/>
<br/>
If the indentation point is in a call to a Lisp function, that<br/>
function's `common-lisp-indent-function' property specifies how<br/>
this function should indent it.  Possible values for this<br/>
property are:<br/>
<br/>
* defun, meaning indent according to `lisp-indent-defun-method';<br/>
  i.e., like (4 &lambda &body), as explained below.<br/>
<br/>
* any other symbol, meaning a function to call.  The function should<br/>
  take the arguments: PATH STATE INDENT-POINT SEXP-COLUMN NORMAL-INDENT.<br/>
  PATH is a list of integers describing the position of point in terms of<br/>
  list-structure with respect to the containing lists.  For example, in<br/>
  ((a b c (d foo) f) g), foo has a path of (0 3 1).  In other words,<br/>
  to reach foo take the 0th element of the outermost list, then<br/>
  the 3rd element of the next list, and finally the 1st element.<br/>
  STATE and INDENT-POINT are as in the arguments to<br/>
  `common-lisp-indent-function'.  SEXP-COLUMN is the column of<br/>
  the open parenthesis of the innermost containing list.<br/>
  NORMAL-INDENT is the column the indentation point was<br/>
  originally in.  This function should behave like `lisp-indent-259'.<br/>
<br/>
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments like<br/>
  function arguments, and any further arguments like a body.<br/>
  This is equivalent to (4 4 ... &body).<br/>
<br/>
* a list.  The list element in position M specifies how to indent the Mth<br/>
  function argument.  If there are fewer elements than function arguments,<br/>
  the last list element applies to all remaining arguments.  The accepted<br/>
  list elements are:<br/>
<br/>
  * nil, meaning the default indentation.<br/>
<br/>
  * an integer, specifying an explicit indentation.<br/>
<br/>
  * &lambda.  Indent the argument (which may be a list) by 4.<br/>
<br/>
  * &rest.  When used, this must be the penultimate element.  The<br/>
    element after this one applies to all remaining arguments.<br/>
<br/>
  * &body.  This is equivalent to &rest lisp-body-indent, i.e., indent<br/>
    all remaining elements by `lisp-body-indent'.<br/>
<br/>
  * &whole.  This must be followed by nil, an integer, or a<br/>
    function symbol.  This indentation is applied to the<br/>
    associated argument, and as a base indent for all remaining<br/>
    arguments.  For example, an integer P means indent this<br/>
    argument by P, and all remaining arguments by P, plus the<br/>
    value specified by their associated list element.<br/>
<br/>
  * a symbol.  A function to call, with the 6 arguments specified above.<br/>
<br/>
  * a list, with elements as described above.  This applies when the<br/>
    associated function argument is itself a list.  Each element of the list<br/>
    specifies how to indent the associated argument.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the function `case' has an indent property<br/>
(4 &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1)), meaning:<br/>
  * indent the first argument by 4.<br/>
  * arguments after the first should be lists, and there may be any number<br/>
    of them.  The first list element has an offset of 2, all the rest<br/>
    have an offset of 2+1=3.
