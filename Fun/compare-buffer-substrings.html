<strong>compare-buffer-substrings</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(compare-buffer-substrings <u>BUFFER1</u> <u>START1</u> <u>END1</u> <u>BUFFER2</u> <u>START2</u> <u>END2</u>)</br>
</br>
Compare two substrings of two buffers; return result as number.</br>
Return -N if first string is less after N-1 chars, +N if first string is</br>
greater after N-1 chars, or 0 if strings match.  Each substring is</br>
represented as three arguments: BUFFER, START and END.  That makes six</br>
args in all, three for each substring.</br>
</br>
The value of `case-fold-search' in the current buffer</br>
determines whether case is significant or ignored.
