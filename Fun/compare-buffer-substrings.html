<strong>compare-buffer-substrings</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(compare-buffer-substrings BUFFER1 START1 END1 BUFFER2 START2 END2)<br/>
<br/>
Compare two substrings of two buffers; return result as number.<br/>
Return -N if first string is less after N-1 chars, +N if first string is<br/>
greater after N-1 chars, or 0 if strings match.  Each substring is<br/>
represented as three arguments: BUFFER, START and END.  That makes six<br/>
args in all, three for each substring.<br/>
<br/>
The value of `case-fold-search' in the current buffer<br/>
determines whether case is significant or ignored.
