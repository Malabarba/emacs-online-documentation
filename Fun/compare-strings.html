<strong>compare-strings</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(compare-strings <u>STR1</u> <u>START1</u> <u>END1</u> <u>STR2</u> <u>START2</u> <u>END2</u> &optional <u>IGNORE-CASE</u>)</br>
</br>
Compare the contents of two strings, converting to multibyte if needed.</br>
The arguments <u>START1</u>, <u>END1</u>, <u>START2</u>, and <u>END2</u>, if non-nil, are</br>
positions specifying which parts of <u>STR1</u> or <u>STR2</u> to compare.  In</br>
string <u>STR1</u>, compare the part between <u>START1</u> (inclusive) and <u>END1</u></br>
(exclusive).  If <u>START1</u> is nil, it defaults to 0, the beginning of</br>
the string; if <u>END1</u> is nil, it defaults to the length of the string.</br>
Likewise, in string <u>STR2</u>, compare the part between <u>START2</u> and <u>END2</u>.</br>
Like in `substring', negative values are counted from the end.</br>
</br>
The strings are compared by the numeric values of their characters.</br>
For instance, <u>STR1</u> is "less than" <u>STR2</u> if its first differing</br>
character has a smaller numeric value.  If <u>IGNORE-CASE</u> is non-nil,</br>
characters are converted to lower-case before comparing them.  Unibyte</br>
strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.</br>
</br>
The value is t if the strings (or specified portions) match.</br>
If string <u>STR1</u> is less, the value is a negative number N;</br>
  - 1 - N is the number of characters that match at the beginning.</br>
If string <u>STR1</u> is greater, the value is a positive number N;</br>
  N - 1 is the number of characters that match at the beginning.
