compare-strings is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(compare-strings STR1 START1 END1 STR2 START2 END2 &optional IGNORE-CASE)<br/><br/>Compare the contents of two strings, converting to multibyte if needed.<br/>The arguments START1, END1, START2, and END2, if non-nil, are<br/>positions specifying which parts of STR1 or STR2 to compare.  In<br/>string STR1, compare the part between START1 (inclusive) and END1<br/>(exclusive).  If START1 is nil, it defaults to 0, the beginning of<br/>the string; if END1 is nil, it defaults to the length of the string.<br/>Likewise, in string STR2, compare the part between START2 and END2.<br/><br/>The strings are compared by the numeric values of their characters.<br/>For instance, STR1 is "less than" STR2 if its first differing<br/>character has a smaller numeric value.  If IGNORE-CASE is non-nil,<br/>characters are converted to lower-case before comparing them.  Unibyte<br/>strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.<br/><br/>The value is t if the strings (or specified portions) match.<br/>If string STR1 is less, the value is a negative number N;<br/>  - 1 - N is the number of characters that match at the beginning.<br/>If string STR1 is greater, the value is a positive number N;<br/>  N - 1 is the number of characters that match at the beginning.
