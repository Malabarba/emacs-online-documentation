compare-windows is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `compare-w.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <menu-bar> <tools> <compare> <window>.<br/><br/>(compare-windows IGNORE-WHITESPACE)<br/><br/>Compare text in current window with text in next window.<br/>Compares the text starting at point in each window,<br/>moving over text in each one as far as they match.<br/><br/>This command pushes the mark in each window<br/>at the prior location of point in that window.<br/>If both windows display the same buffer,<br/>the mark is pushed twice in that buffer:<br/>first in the other window, then in the selected window.<br/><br/>A prefix arg means reverse the value of variable<br/>`compare-ignore-whitespace'.  If `compare-ignore-whitespace' is<br/>nil, then a prefix arg means ignore changes in whitespace.  If<br/>`compare-ignore-whitespace' is non-nil, then a prefix arg means<br/>don't ignore changes in whitespace.  The variable<br/>`compare-windows-whitespace' controls how whitespace is skipped.<br/>If `compare-ignore-case' is non-nil, changes in case are also<br/>ignored.<br/><br/>If `compare-windows-sync' is non-nil, then successive calls of<br/>this command work in interlaced mode:<br/>on first call it advances points to the next difference,<br/>on second call it synchronizes points by skipping the difference,<br/>on third call it again advances points to the next difference and so on.
