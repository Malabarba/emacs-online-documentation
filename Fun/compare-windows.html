<strong>compare-windows</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>compare-w.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;menu-bar> &lt;tools> &lt;compare> &lt;window>.</br>
</br>
<code>(compare-windows <u>IGNORE-WHITESPACE</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Compare text in current window with text in another window.</br>
The option `compare-windows-get-window-function' defines how</br>
to get another window.</br>
</br>
Compares the text starting at point in each window,</br>
moving over text in each one as far as they match.</br>
</br>
This command pushes the mark in each window</br>
at the prior location of point in that window.</br>
If both windows display the same buffer,</br>
the mark is pushed twice in that buffer:</br>
first in the other window, then in the selected window.</br>
</br>
A prefix arg means reverse the value of variable</br>
`compare-ignore-whitespace'.  If `compare-ignore-whitespace' is</br>
nil, then a prefix arg means ignore changes in whitespace.  If</br>
`compare-ignore-whitespace' is non-nil, then a prefix arg means</br>
don't ignore changes in whitespace.  The variable</br>
`compare-windows-whitespace' controls how whitespace is skipped.</br>
If `compare-ignore-case' is non-nil, changes in case are also</br>
ignored.</br>
</br>
If `compare-windows-sync' is non-nil, then successive calls of</br>
this command work in interlaced mode:</br>
on first call it advances points to the next difference,</br>
on second call it synchronizes points by skipping the difference,</br>
on third call it again advances points to the next difference and so on.
