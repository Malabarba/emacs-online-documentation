<strong>compilation-fake-loc</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>compile.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(compilation-fake-loc <u>MARKER</u> <u>FILE</u> &optional <u>LINE</u> <u>COL</u>)</br>
</br>
Preassociate <u>MARKER</u> with <u>FILE</u>.</br>
<u>FILE</u> should be ABSOLUTE-FILENAME or (RELATIVE-FILENAME . DIRNAME).</br>
This is useful when you compile temporary files, but want</br>
automatic translation of the messages to the real buffer from</br>
which the temporary file came.  This may also affect previous messages</br>
about <u>FILE</u>.</br>
</br>
Optional args <u>LINE</u> and <u>COL</u> default to 1 and beginning of</br>
indentation respectively.  The marker is expected to reflect</br>
this.  In the simplest case the marker points to the first line</br>
of the region that was saved to the temp file.</br>
</br>
If you concatenate several regions into the temp file (e.g. a</br>
header with variable assignments and a code region), you must</br>
call this several times, once each for the last line of one</br>
region and the first line of the next region.
