<strong>compilation-fake-loc</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>compile.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(compilation-fake-loc MARKER FILE &optional LINE COL)<br/>
<br/>
Preassociate MARKER with FILE.<br/>
FILE should be ABSOLUTE-FILENAME or (RELATIVE-FILENAME . DIRNAME).<br/>
This is useful when you compile temporary files, but want<br/>
automatic translation of the messages to the real buffer from<br/>
which the temporary file came.  This may also affect previous messages<br/>
about FILE.<br/>
<br/>
Optional args LINE and COL default to 1 and beginning of<br/>
indentation respectively.  The marker is expected to reflect<br/>
this.  In the simplest case the marker points to the first line<br/>
of the region that was saved to the temp file.<br/>
<br/>
If you concatenate several regions into the temp file (e.g. a<br/>
header with variable assignments and a code region), you must<br/>
call this several times, once each for the last line of one<br/>
region and the first line of the next region.
