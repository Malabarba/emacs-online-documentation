<strong>compilation-find-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>compile.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(compilation-find-file <u>MARKER</u> <u>FILENAME</u> <u>DIRECTORY</u> &rest <u>FORMATS</u>)</br>
</br>
Find a buffer for file <u>FILENAME</u>.</br>
If <u>FILENAME</u> is not found at all, ask the user where to find it.</br>
Pop up the buffer containing <u>MARKER</u> and scroll to <u>MARKER</u> if we ask</br>
the user where to find the file.</br>
Search the directories in `compilation-search-path'.</br>
A nil in `compilation-search-path' means to try the</br>
"current" directory, which is passed in <u>DIRECTORY</u>.</br>
If <u>DIRECTORY</u> is relative, it is combined with `default-directory'.</br>
If <u>DIRECTORY</u> is nil, that means use `default-directory'.</br>
<u>FORMATS</u>, if given, is a list of formats to reformat <u>FILENAME</u> when</br>
looking for it: for each element FMT in <u>FORMATS</u>, this function</br>
attempts to find a file whose name is produced by (format FMT <u>FILENAME</u>).
