<strong>compilation-find-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>compile.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(compilation-find-file MARKER FILENAME DIRECTORY &rest FORMATS)<br/>
<br/>
Find a buffer for file FILENAME.<br/>
If FILENAME is not found at all, ask the user where to find it.<br/>
Pop up the buffer containing MARKER and scroll to MARKER if we ask<br/>
the user where to find the file.<br/>
Search the directories in `compilation-search-path'.<br/>
A nil in `compilation-search-path' means to try the<br/>
"current" directory, which is passed in DIRECTORY.<br/>
If DIRECTORY is relative, it is combined with `default-directory'.<br/>
If DIRECTORY is nil, that means use `default-directory'.<br/>
FORMATS, if given, is a list of formats to reformat FILENAME when<br/>
looking for it: for each element FMT in FORMATS, this function<br/>
attempts to find a file whose name is produced by (format FMT FILENAME).
