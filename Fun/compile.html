<strong>compile</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>compile.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <tools> <compile>.<br/>
<br/>
(compile COMMAND &optional COMINT)<br/>
<br/>
Compile the program including the current buffer.  Default: run `make'.<br/>
Runs COMMAND, a shell command, in a separate process asynchronously<br/>
with output going to the buffer `*compilation*'.<br/>
<br/>
You can then use the command C-x ` to find the next error message<br/>
and move to the source code that caused it.<br/>
<br/>
If optional second arg COMINT is t the buffer will be in Comint mode with<br/>
`compilation-shell-minor-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, prompts for the command if `compilation-read-command' is<br/>
non-nil; otherwise uses `compile-command'.  With prefix arg, always prompts.<br/>
Additionally, with universal prefix arg, compilation buffer will be in<br/>
comint mode, i.e. interactive.<br/>
<br/>
To run more than one compilation at once, start one then rename<br/>
the `*compilation*' buffer to some other name with<br/>
M-x rename-buffer.  Then _switch buffers_ and start the new compilation.<br/>
It will create a new `*compilation*' buffer.<br/>
<br/>
On most systems, termination of the main compilation process<br/>
kills its subprocesses.<br/>
<br/>
The name used for the buffer is actually whatever is returned by<br/>
the function in `compilation-buffer-name-function', so you can set that<br/>
to a function that generates a unique name.
