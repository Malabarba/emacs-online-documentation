<strong>completion-boundaries</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(completion-boundaries <u>STRING</u> <u>TABLE</u> <u>PRED</u> <u>SUFFIX</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the boundaries of the completions returned by <u>TABLE</u> for <u>STRING</u>.</br>
<u>STRING</u> is the string on which completion will be performed.</br>
<u>SUFFIX</u> is the string after point.</br>
The result is of the form (START . END) where START is the position</br>
in <u>STRING</u> of the beginning of the completion field and END is the position</br>
in <u>SUFFIX</u> of the end of the completion field.</br>
E.g. for simple completion tables, the result is always (0 . (length <u>SUFFIX</u>))</br>
and for file names the result is the positions delimited by</br>
the closest directory separators.
