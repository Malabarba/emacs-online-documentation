</br>
</br>
(completion-kill-region &optional <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Kill between point and mark.</br>
The text is deleted but saved in the kill ring.</br>
The command C-y can retrieve it from there.</br>
/(If you want to kill and then yank immediately, use M-x copy-region-as-kill.)</br>
</br>
This is the primitive for programs to kill text (as opposed to deleting it).</br>
Supply two arguments, character positions indicating the stretch of text</br>
 to be killed.</br>
Any command that calls this function is a "kill command".</br>
If the previous command was also a kill command,</br>
the text killed this time appends to the text killed last time</br>
to make one entry in the kill ring.</br>
