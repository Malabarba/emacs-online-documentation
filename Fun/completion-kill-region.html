<strong>completion-kill-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>completion.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(completion-kill-region &optional BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Kill between point and mark.<br/>
The text is deleted but saved in the kill ring.<br/>
The command C-y can retrieve it from there.<br/>
/(If you want to kill and then yank immediately, use M-x copy-region-as-kill.)<br/>
<br/>
This is the primitive for programs to kill text (as opposed to deleting it).<br/>
Supply two arguments, character positions indicating the stretch of text<br/>
 to be killed.<br/>
Any command that calls this function is a "kill command".<br/>
If the previous command was also a kill command,<br/>
the text killed this time appends to the text killed last time<br/>
to make one entry in the kill ring.<br/>
Patched to remove the most recent completion.
