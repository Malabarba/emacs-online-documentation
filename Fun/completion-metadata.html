completion-metadata is a compiled Lisp function in `minibuffer.el'.<br/><br/>(completion-metadata STRING TABLE PRED)<br/><br/>Return the metadata of elements to complete at the end of STRING.<br/>This metadata is an alist.  Currently understood keys are:<br/>- `category': the kind of objects returned by `all-completions'.<br/>   Used by `completion-category-overrides'.<br/>- `annotation-function': function to add annotations in *Completions*.<br/>   Takes one argument (STRING), which is a possible completion and<br/>   returns a string to append to STRING.<br/>- `display-sort-function': function to sort entries in *Completions*.<br/>   Takes one argument (COMPLETIONS) and should return a new list<br/>   of completions.  Can operate destructively.<br/>- `cycle-sort-function': function to sort entries when cycling.<br/>   Works like `display-sort-function'.<br/>The metadata of a completion table should be constant between two boundaries.
