<strong>completion-pcm--merge-completions</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(completion-pcm--merge-completions STRS PATTERN)<br/>
<br/>
Extract the commonality in STRS, with the help of PATTERN.<br/>
PATTERN can contain strings and symbols chosen among `star', `any', `point',<br/>
and `prefix'.  They all match anything (aka ".*") but are merged differently:<br/>
`any' only grows from the left (when matching "a1b" and "a2b" it gets<br/>
  completed to just "a").<br/>
`prefix' only grows from the right (when matching "a1b" and "a2b" it gets<br/>
  completed to just "b").<br/>
`star' grows from both ends and is reified into a "*"  (when matching "a1b"<br/>
  and "a2b" it gets completed to "a*b").<br/>
`point' is like `star' except that it gets reified as the position of point<br/>
  instead of being reified as a "*" character.<br/>
The underlying idea is that we should return a string which still matches<br/>
the same set of elements.
