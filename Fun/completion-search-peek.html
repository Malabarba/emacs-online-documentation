<strong>completion-search-peek</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>completion.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(completion-search-peek <u>USE-CDABBREV</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the next completion entry without actually moving the pointers.</br>
Calling this again or calling `completion-search-next' results in the same</br>
string being returned.  Depends on `case-fold-search'.</br>
If there are no more entries, try cdabbrev and then return only a string.
