<br/>
(completion-table-with-quoting TABLE UNQUOTE REQUOTE)<br/>
<br/>
Return a new completion table operating on quoted text.<br/>

UNQUOTE is a function that takes a string and returns a new unquoted string.<br/>
REQUOTE is a function of 2 args (UPOS QSTR) where<br/>
  QSTR is a string entered by the user (and hence indicating<br/>
  the user's preferred form of quoting); and<br/>
  UPOS is a position within the unquoted form of QSTR.<br/>
REQUOTE should return a pair (QPOS . QFUN) such that QPOS is the<br/>
position corresponding to UPOS but in QSTR, and QFUN is a function<br/>
of one argument (a string) which returns that argument appropriately quoted<br/>
for use at QPOS.
