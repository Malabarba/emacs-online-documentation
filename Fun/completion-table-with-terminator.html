<strong>completion-table-with-terminator</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(completion-table-with-terminator <u>TERMINATOR</u> <u>TABLE</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>PRED</u> <u>ACTION</u>)</br>
</br>
Construct a completion table like <u>TABLE</u> but with an extra <u>TERMINATOR</u>.</br>
This is meant to be called in a curried way by first passing <u>TERMINATOR</u></br>
and <u>TABLE</u> only (via `apply-partially').</br>
<u>TABLE</u> is a completion table, and <u>TERMINATOR</u> is a string appended to <u>TABLE</u>'s</br>
completion if it is complete.  <u>TERMINATOR</u> is also used to determine the</br>
completion suffix's boundary.</br>
<u>TERMINATOR</u> can also be a cons cell (<u>TERMINATOR</u> . TERMINATOR-REGEXP)</br>
in which case TERMINATOR-REGEXP is a regular expression whose submatch</br>
number 1 should match <u>TERMINATOR</u>.  This is used when there is a need to</br>
distinguish occurrences of the <u>TERMINATOR</u> strings which are really terminators</br>
from others (e.g. escaped).  In this form, the car of <u>TERMINATOR</u> can also be,</br>
instead of a string, a function that takes the completion and returns the</br>
"terminated" string.
