<strong>completion-table-with-terminator</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(completion-table-with-terminator TERMINATOR TABLE STRING PRED ACTION)<br/>
<br/>
Construct a completion table like TABLE but with an extra TERMINATOR.<br/>
This is meant to be called in a curried way by first passing TERMINATOR<br/>
and TABLE only (via `apply-partially').<br/>
TABLE is a completion table, and TERMINATOR is a string appended to TABLE's<br/>
completion if it is complete.  TERMINATOR is also used to determine the<br/>
completion suffix's boundary.<br/>
TERMINATOR can also be a cons cell (TERMINATOR . TERMINATOR-REGEXP)<br/>
in which case TERMINATOR-REGEXP is a regular expression whose submatch<br/>
number 1 should match TERMINATOR.  This is used when there is a need to<br/>
distinguish occurrences of the TERMINATOR strings which are really terminators<br/>
from others (e.g. escaped).  In this form, the car of TERMINATOR can also be,<br/>
instead of a string, a function that takes the completion and returns the<br/>
"terminated" string.
