<strong>compose-last-chars</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>composite.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;compose-last-chars>.</br>
</br>
<code>(compose-last-chars <u>ARGS</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Compose last characters.</br>
The argument is a parameterized event of the form</br>
	(compose-last-chars N COMPONENTS),</br>
where N is the number of characters before point to compose,</br>
COMPONENTS, if non-nil, is the same as the argument to `compose-region'</br>
(which see).  If it is nil, `compose-chars-after' is called,</br>
and that function finds a proper rule to compose the target characters.</br>
This function is intended to be used from input methods.</br>
The global keymap binds special event `compose-last-chars' to this</br>
function.  Input method may generate an event (compose-last-chars N COMPONENTS)</br>
after a sequence of character events.
