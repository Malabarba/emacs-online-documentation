<strong>compose-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>composite.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(compose-region <u>START</u> <u>END</u> &optional <u>COMPONENTS</u> <u>MODIFICATION-FUNC</u>)</br>
</br>
Compose characters in the current region.</br>
</br>
Characters are composed relatively, i.e. composed by overstriking</br>
or stacking depending on ascent, descent and other metrics of</br>
glyphs.</br>
</br>
For instance, if the region has three characters "XYZ", X is</br>
regarded as BASE glyph, and Y is displayed:</br>
  (1) above BASE if Y's descent value is not positive</br>
  (2) below BASE if Y's ascent value is not positive</br>
  (3) on BASE (i.e. at the BASE position) otherwise</br>
and Z is displayed with the same rule while regarding the whole</br>
XY glyphs as BASE.</br>
</br>
When called from a program, expects these four arguments.</br>
</br>
First two arguments <u>START</u> and <u>END</u> are positions (integers or markers)</br>
specifying the region.</br>
</br>
Optional 3rd argument <u>COMPONENTS</u>, if non-nil, is a character, a string</br>
or a vector or list of integers and rules.</br>
</br>
If it is a character, it is an alternate character to display instead</br>
of the text in the region.</br>
</br>
If it is a string, the elements are alternate characters.  In</br>
this case, TAB element has a special meaning.  If the first</br>
character is TAB, the glyphs are displayed with left padding space</br>
so that no pixel overlaps with the previous column.  If the last</br>
character is TAB, the glyphs are displayed with right padding</br>
space so that no pixel overlaps with the following column.</br>
</br>
If it is a vector or list, it is a sequence of alternate characters and</br>
composition rules, where (2N)th elements are characters and (2N+1)th</br>
elements are composition rules to specify how to compose (2N+2)th</br>
elements with previously composed N glyphs.</br>
</br>
A composition rule is a cons of global and new glyph reference point</br>
symbols.  See the documentation of `reference-point-alist' for more</br>
details.</br>
</br>
Optional 4th argument <u>MODIFICATION-FUNC</u> is a function to call to</br>
adjust the composition when it gets invalid because of a change of</br>
text in the composition.
