composition-get-gstring is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(composition-get-gstring FROM TO FONT-OBJECT STRING)<br/><br/>Return a glyph-string for characters between FROM and TO.<br/>If the glyph string is for graphic display, FONT-OBJECT must be<br/>a font-object to use for those characters.<br/>Otherwise (for terminal display), FONT-OBJECT must be a terminal ID, a<br/>frame, or nil for the selected frame's terminal device.<br/><br/>If the optional 4th argument STRING is not nil, it is a string<br/>containing the target characters between indices FROM and TO.<br/><br/>A glyph-string is a vector containing information about how to display<br/>a specific character sequence.  The format is:<br/>   [HEADER ID GLYPH ...]<br/><br/>HEADER is a vector of this form:<br/>    [FONT-OBJECT CHAR ...]<br/>where<br/>    FONT-OBJECT is a font-object for all glyphs in the glyph-string,<br/>    or the terminal coding system of the specified terminal.<br/>    CHARs are characters to be composed by GLYPHs.<br/><br/>ID is an identification number of the glyph-string.  It may be nil if<br/>not yet shaped.<br/><br/>GLYPH is a vector whose elements have this form:<br/>    [ FROM-IDX TO-IDX C CODE WIDTH LBEARING RBEARING ASCENT DESCENT<br/>      [ [X-OFF Y-OFF WADJUST] | nil] ]<br/>where<br/>    FROM-IDX and TO-IDX are used internally and should not be touched.<br/>    C is the character of the glyph.<br/>    CODE is the glyph-code of C in FONT-OBJECT.<br/>    WIDTH thru DESCENT are the metrics (in pixels) of the glyph.<br/>    X-OFF and Y-OFF are offsets to the base position for the glyph.<br/>    WADJUST is the adjustment to the normal width of the glyph.<br/><br/>If GLYPH is nil, the remaining elements of the glyph-string vector<br/>should be ignored.
