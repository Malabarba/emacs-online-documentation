</br>
(compute-motion <u>FROM</u> <u>FROMPOS</u> <u>TO</u> <u>TOPOS</u> <u>WIDTH</u> <u>OFFSETS</u> <u>WINDOW</u>)</br>
</br>
Scan through the current buffer, calculating screen position.</br>
Scan the current buffer forward from offset <u>FROM</u>,</br>
assuming it is at position <u>FROMPOS</u>--a cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--</br>
to position <u>TO</u> or position <u>TOPOS</u>--another cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--</br>
and return the ending buffer position and screen location.</br>
</br>
If <u>TOPOS</u> is nil, the actual width and height of the window's</br>
text area are used.</br>
</br>
There are three additional arguments:</br>
</br>
<u>WIDTH</u> is the number of columns available to display text;</br>
this affects handling of continuation lines.  A value of nil</br>
corresponds to the actual number of available text columns.</br>
</br>
<u>OFFSETS</u> is either nil or a cons cell (HSCROLL . TAB-OFFSET).</br>
HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left</br>
margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.</br>
TAB-OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't</br>
being displayed, perhaps because the line was continued within it.</br>
If <u>OFFSETS</u> is nil, HSCROLL and TAB-OFFSET are assumed to be zero.</br>
</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> is the window to operate on.  It is used to choose the display table;</br>
if it is showing the current buffer, it is used also for</br>
deciding which overlay properties apply.</br>
Note that `compute-motion' always operates on the current buffer.</br>
</br>
The value is a list of five elements:</br>
  (POS HPOS VPOS PREVHPOS CONTIN)</br>
POS is the buffer position where the scan stopped.</br>
VPOS is the vertical position where the scan stopped.</br>
HPOS is the horizontal position where the scan stopped.</br>
</br>
PREVHPOS is the horizontal position one character back from POS.</br>
CONTIN is t if a line was continued after (or within) the previous character.</br>
</br>
For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE</br>
of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as <u>FROM</u></br>
and the window's upper-left coordinates as <u>FROMPOS</u>.</br>
Pass the buffer's (point-max) as <u>TO</u>, to limit the scan to the end of the</br>
visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as <u>TOPOS</u>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
