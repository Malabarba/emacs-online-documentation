cond is a special form in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(cond CLAUSES...)<br/><br/>Try each clause until one succeeds.<br/>Each clause looks like (CONDITION BODY...).  CONDITION is evaluated<br/>and, if the value is non-nil, this clause succeeds:<br/>then the expressions in BODY are evaluated and the last one's<br/>value is the value of the cond-form.<br/>If no clause succeeds, cond returns nil.<br/>If a clause has one element, as in (CONDITION),<br/>CONDITION's value if non-nil is returned from the cond-form.
