<strong>conf-quote-normal</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>conf-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(conf-quote-normal ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Set the syntax of ' and " to punctuation.<br/>
With prefix arg, only do it for ' if 1, or only for " if 2.<br/>
This only affects the current buffer.  Some conf files use quotes<br/>
to delimit strings, while others allow quotes as simple parts of<br/>
the assigned value.  In those files font locking will be wrong,<br/>
and you can correct it with this command.  (Some files even do<br/>
both, i.e. quotes delimit strings, except when they are<br/>
unbalanced, but hey...)
