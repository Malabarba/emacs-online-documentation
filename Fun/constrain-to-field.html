<strong>constrain-to-field</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(constrain-to-field <u>NEW-POS</u> <u>OLD-POS</u> &optional <u>ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE</u> <u>ONLY-IN-LINE</u> <u>INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the position closest to <u>NEW-POS</u> that is in the same field as <u>OLD-POS</u>.</br>
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.</br>
</br>
If <u>NEW-POS</u> is nil, then use the current point instead, and move point</br>
to the resulting constrained position, in addition to returning that</br>
position.</br>
</br>
If <u>OLD-POS</u> is at the boundary of two fields, then the allowable</br>
positions for <u>NEW-POS</u> depends on the value of the optional argument</br>
<u>ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE</u>: If <u>ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE</u> is nil, then <u>NEW-POS</u> is</br>
constrained to the field that has the same `field' char-property</br>
as any new characters inserted at <u>OLD-POS</u>, whereas if <u>ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE</u></br>
is non-nil, <u>NEW-POS</u> is constrained to the union of the two adjacent</br>
fields.  Additionally, if two fields are separated by another field with</br>
the special value `boundary', then any point within this special field is</br>
also considered to be `on the boundary'.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>ONLY-IN-LINE</u> is non-nil and constraining</br>
<u>NEW-POS</u> would move it to a different line, <u>NEW-POS</u> is returned</br>
unconstrained.  This is useful for commands that move by line, like</br>
C-n or M-x beginning-of-line, which should generally respect field boundaries</br>
only in the case where they can still move to the right line.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY</u> is non-nil, and <u>OLD-POS</u> has</br>
a non-nil property of that name, then any field boundaries are ignored.</br>
</br>
Field boundaries are not noticed if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.
