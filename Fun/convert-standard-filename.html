convert-standard-filename is a compiled Lisp function in `files.el'.<br/><br/>(convert-standard-filename FILENAME)<br/><br/>Convert a standard file's name to something suitable for the OS.<br/>This means to guarantee valid names and perhaps to canonicalize<br/>certain patterns.<br/><br/>FILENAME should be an absolute file name since the conversion rules<br/>sometimes vary depending on the position in the file name.  E.g. c:/foo<br/>is a valid DOS file name, but c:/bar/c:/foo is not.<br/><br/>This function's standard definition is trivial; it just returns<br/>the argument.  However, on Windows and DOS, replace invalid<br/>characters.  On DOS, make sure to obey the 8.3 limitations.<br/>In the native Windows build, turn Cygwin names into native names,<br/>and also turn slashes into backslashes if the shell requires it (see<br/>`w32-shell-dos-semantics').<br/><br/>See Info node `(elisp)Standard File Names' for more details.
