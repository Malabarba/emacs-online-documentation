copy-directory is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `files.el'.<br/><br/>(copy-directory DIRECTORY NEWNAME &optional KEEP-TIME PARENTS COPY-CONTENTS)<br/><br/>Copy DIRECTORY to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.<br/>This function always sets the file modes of the output files to match<br/>the corresponding input file.<br/><br/>The third arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the output files the same<br/>last-modified time as the old ones.  (This works on only some systems.)<br/><br/>A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.<br/><br/>Noninteractively, the last argument PARENTS says whether to<br/>create parent directories if they don't exist.  Interactively,<br/>this happens by default.<br/><br/>If NEWNAME names an existing directory, copy DIRECTORY as a<br/>subdirectory there.  However, if called from Lisp with a non-nil<br/>optional argument COPY-CONTENTS, copy the contents of DIRECTORY<br/>directly into NEWNAME instead.
