copy-face is a compiled Lisp function in `faces.el'.<br/><br/>(copy-face OLD-FACE NEW-FACE &optional FRAME NEW-FRAME)<br/><br/>Define a face named NEW-FACE, which is a copy of OLD-FACE.<br/>This function does not copy face customization data, so NEW-FACE<br/>will not be made customizable.  Most Lisp code should not call<br/>this function; use `defface' with :inherit instead.<br/><br/>If NEW-FACE already exists as a face, modify it to be like<br/>OLD-FACE.  If NEW-FACE doesn't already exist, create it.<br/><br/>If the optional argument FRAME is a frame, change NEW-FACE on<br/>FRAME only.  If FRAME is t, copy the frame-independent default<br/>specification for OLD-FACE to NEW-FACE.  If FRAME is nil, copy<br/>the defaults as well as the faces on each existing frame.<br/><br/>If the optional fourth argument NEW-FRAME is given, copy the<br/>information from face OLD-FACE on frame FRAME to NEW-FACE on<br/>frame NEW-FRAME.  In this case, FRAME must not be nil.
