<strong>copy-file</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(copy-file FILE NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS KEEP-TIME PRESERVE-UID-GID PRESERVE-SELINUX-CONTEXT)<br/>
<br/>
Copy FILE to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.<br/>
If NEWNAME names a directory, copy FILE there.<br/>
<br/>
This function always sets the file modes of the output file to match<br/>
the input file.<br/>
<br/>
The optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS specifies what to do<br/>
if file NEWNAME already exists.  If OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is nil, we<br/>
signal a `file-already-exists' error without overwriting.  If<br/>
OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is a number, we request confirmation from the user<br/>
about overwriting; this is what happens in interactive use with M-x.<br/>
Any other value for OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS means to overwrite the<br/>
existing file.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the output file the same<br/>
last-modified time as the old one.  (This works on only some systems.)<br/>
<br/>
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
If PRESERVE-UID-GID is non-nil, we try to transfer the<br/>
uid and gid of FILE to NEWNAME.<br/>
<br/>
If PRESERVE-SELINUX-CONTEXT is non-nil and SELinux is enabled<br/>
on the system, we copy the SELinux context of FILE to NEWNAME.
