<strong>copy-keymap</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(copy-keymap KEYMAP)<br/>
<br/>
Return a copy of the keymap KEYMAP.<br/>
The copy starts out with the same definitions of KEYMAP,<br/>
but changing either the copy or KEYMAP does not affect the other.<br/>
Any key definitions that are subkeymaps are recursively copied.<br/>
However, a key definition which is a symbol whose definition is a keymap<br/>
is not copied.
