<strong>copy-tree</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(copy-tree TREE &optional VECP)<br/>
<br/>
Make a copy of TREE.<br/>
If TREE is a cons cell, this recursively copies both its car and its cdr.<br/>
Contrast to `copy-sequence', which copies only along the cdrs.  With second<br/>
argument VECP, this copies vectors as well as conses.
