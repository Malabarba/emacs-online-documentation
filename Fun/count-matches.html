<strong>count-matches</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="how-many.html">how-many</a></strong>' in `<code>replace.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(count-matches <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>RSTART</u> <u>REND</u> <u>INTERACTIVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Print and return number of matches for <u>REGEXP</u> following point.</br>
When called from Lisp and <u>INTERACTIVE</u> is omitted or nil, just return</br>
the number, do not print it; if <u>INTERACTIVE</u> is t, the function behaves</br>
in all respects as if it had been called interactively.</br>
</br>
If <u>REGEXP</u> contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')</br>
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</br>
</br>
Second and third arg <u>RSTART</u> and <u>REND</u> specify the region to operate on.</br>
</br>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate</br>
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the</br>
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.</br>
</br>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of</br>
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap</br>
a previously found match.
