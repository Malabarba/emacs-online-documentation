<strong>count-matches</strong> is an alias for `how-many' in `<code>replace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(count-matches REGEXP &optional RSTART REND INTERACTIVE)<br/>
<br/>
Print and return number of matches for REGEXP following point.<br/>
When called from Lisp and INTERACTIVE is omitted or nil, just return<br/>
the number, do not print it; if INTERACTIVE is t, the function behaves<br/>
in all respects as if it had been called interactively.<br/>
<br/>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')<br/>
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate<br/>
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the<br/>
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of<br/>
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap<br/>
a previously found match.
