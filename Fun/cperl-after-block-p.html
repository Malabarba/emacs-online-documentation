<br/>
(cperl-after-block-p LIM &optional PRE-BLOCK)<br/>
<br/>
Return true if the preceding } (if PRE-BLOCK, following {) delimits a block.<br/>
Would not look before LIM.  Assumes that LIM is a good place to begin a<br/>
statement.  The kind of block we treat here is one after which a new<br/>
statement would start; thus the block in ${func()} does not count.
