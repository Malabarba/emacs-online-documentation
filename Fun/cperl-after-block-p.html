<strong>cperl-after-block-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cperl-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cperl-after-block-p <u>LIM</u> &optional <u>PRE-BLOCK</u>)</br>
</br>
Return true if the preceding } (if <u>PRE-BLOCK</u>, following {) delimits a block.</br>
Would not look before <u>LIM</u>.  Assumes that <u>LIM</u> is a good place to begin a</br>
statement.  The kind of block we treat here is one after which a new</br>
statement would start; thus the block in ${func()} does not count.
