<strong>create-image</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>image.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(create-image <u>FILE-OR-DATA</u> &optional <u>TYPE</u> <u>DATA-P</u> &rest <u>PROPS</u>)</br>
</br>
Create an image.</br>
<u>FILE-OR-DATA</u> is an image file name or image data.</br>
Optional <u>TYPE</u> is a symbol describing the image type.  If <u>TYPE</u> is omitted</br>
or nil, try to determine the image type from its first few bytes</br>
of image data.  If that doesn't work, and <u>FILE-OR-DATA</u> is a file name,</br>
use its file extension as image type.</br>
Optional <u>DATA-P</u> non-nil means <u>FILE-OR-DATA</u> is a string containing image data.</br>
Optional <u>PROPS</u> are additional image attributes to assign to the image,</br>
like, e.g. `:mask MASK'.</br>
Value is the image created, or nil if images of type <u>TYPE</u> are not supported.</br>
</br>
Images should not be larger than specified by `max-image-size'.</br>
</br>
Image file names that are not absolute are searched for in the</br>
"images" sub-directory of `data-directory' and</br>
`x-bitmap-file-path' (in that order).
