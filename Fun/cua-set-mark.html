<strong>cua-set-mark</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>cua-base.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cua-set-mark &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Set mark at where point is, clear mark, or jump to mark.<br/>
<br/>
With no prefix argument, clear mark if already set.  Otherwise, set<br/>
mark, and push old mark position on local mark ring; also push mark on<br/>
global mark ring if last mark was set in another buffer.<br/>
<br/>
With argument, jump to mark, and pop a new position for mark off<br/>
the local mark ring (this does not affect the global mark ring).<br/>
Use C-x C-@ to jump to a mark off the global mark ring<br/>
(see `pop-global-mark').<br/>
<br/>
If `cua-auto-mark-last-change' is non-nil, this command behaves as if there<br/>
was an implicit mark at the position of the last buffer change.<br/>
<br/>
Repeating the command without the prefix jumps to the next position<br/>
off the local (or global) mark ring.<br/>
<br/>
With a double C-u prefix argument, unconditionally set mark.
