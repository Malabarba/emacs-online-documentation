<strong>current-column</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(current-column)</br>
</br>
Return the horizontal position of point.  Beginning of line is column 0.</br>
This is calculated by adding together the widths of all the displayed</br>
representations of the character between the start of the previous line</br>
and point (e.g., control characters will have a width of 2 or 4, tabs</br>
will have a variable width).</br>
Ignores finite width of frame, which means that this function may return</br>
values greater than (frame-width).</br>
Whether the line is visible (if `selective-display' is t) has no effect;</br>
however, ^M is treated as end of line when `selective-display' is t.</br>
Text that has an invisible property is considered as having width 0, unless</br>
`buffer-invisibility-spec' specifies that it is replaced by an ellipsis.
