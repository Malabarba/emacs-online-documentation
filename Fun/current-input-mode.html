<strong>current-input-mode</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(current-input-mode)</br>
</br>
Return information about the way Emacs currently reads keyboard input.</br>
The value is a list of the form (INTERRUPT FLOW META QUIT), where</br>
  INTERRUPT is non-nil if Emacs is using interrupt-driven input; if</br>
    nil, Emacs is using CBREAK mode.</br>
  FLOW is non-nil if Emacs uses ^S/^Q flow control for output to the</br>
    terminal; this does not apply if Emacs uses interrupt-driven input.</br>
  META is t if accepting 8-bit input with 8th bit as Meta flag.</br>
    META nil means ignoring the top bit, on the assumption it is parity.</br>
    META is neither t nor nil if accepting 8-bit input and using</br>
    all 8 bits as the character code.</br>
  QUIT is the character Emacs currently uses to quit.</br>
The elements of this list correspond to the arguments of</br>
`set-input-mode'.
