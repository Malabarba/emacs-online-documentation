<strong>current-kill</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(current-kill <u>N</u> &optional <u>DO-NOT-MOVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Rotate the yanking point by <u>N</u> places, and then return that kill.</br>
If <u>N</u> is zero and `interprogram-paste-function' is set to a</br>
function that returns a string or a list of strings, and if that</br>
function doesn't return nil, then that string (or list) is added</br>
to the front of the kill ring and the string (or first string in</br>
the list) is returned as the latest kill.</br>
</br>
If <u>N</u> is not zero, and if `yank-pop-change-selection' is</br>
non-nil, use `interprogram-cut-function' to transfer the</br>
kill at the new yank point into the window system selection.</br>
</br>
If optional arg <u>DO-NOT-MOVE</u> is non-nil, then don't actually</br>
move the yanking point; just return the <u>N</u>th kill forward.
