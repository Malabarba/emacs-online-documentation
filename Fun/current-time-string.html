<strong>current-time-string</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(current-time-string &optional <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the current local time, as a human-readable string.</br>
Programs can use this function to decode a time,</br>
since the number of columns in each field is fixed</br>
if the year is in the range 1000-9999.</br>
The format is `Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973'.</br>
However, see also the functions `decode-time' and `format-time-string'</br>
which provide a much more powerful and general facility.</br>
</br>
If <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u> is given, it is a time to format instead of the</br>
current time.  The argument should have the form (HIGH LOW . IGNORED).</br>
Thus, you can use times obtained from `current-time' and from</br>
`file-attributes'.  <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u> can also have the form (HIGH . LOW),</br>
but this is considered obsolete.
