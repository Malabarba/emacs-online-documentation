<strong>current-time-zone</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(current-time-zone &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)<br/>
<br/>
Return the offset and name for the local time zone.<br/>
This returns a list of the form (OFFSET NAME).<br/>
OFFSET is an integer number of seconds ahead of UTC (east of Greenwich).<br/>
    A negative value means west of Greenwich.<br/>
NAME is a string giving the name of the time zone.<br/>
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, the time zone offset is determined from it<br/>
instead of using the current time.  The argument should have the form<br/>
(HIGH LOW . IGNORED).  Thus, you can use times obtained from<br/>
`current-time' and from `file-attributes'.  SPECIFIED-TIME can also<br/>
have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is considered obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
Some operating systems cannot provide all this information to Emacs;<br/>
in this case, `current-time-zone' returns a list containing nil for<br/>
the data it can't find.
