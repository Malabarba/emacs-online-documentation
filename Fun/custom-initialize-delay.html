<strong>custom-initialize-delay</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>custom.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(custom-initialize-delay <u>SYMBOL</u> <u>VALUE</u>)</br>
</br>
Delay initialization of <u>SYMBOL</u> to the next Emacs start.</br>
This is used in files that are preloaded (or for autoloaded</br>
variables), so that the initialization is done in the run-time</br>
context rather than the build-time context.  This also has the</br>
side-effect that the (delayed) initialization is performed with</br>
the :set function.</br>
</br>
For variables in preloaded files, you can simply use this</br>
function for the :initialize property.  For autoloaded variables,</br>
you will also need to add an autoload stanza calling this</br>
function, and another one setting the standard-value property.</br>
Or you can wrap the defcustom in a progn, to force the autoloader</br>
to include all of it.
