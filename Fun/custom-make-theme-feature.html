<strong>custom-make-theme-feature</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>custom.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(custom-make-theme-feature <u>THEME</u>)</br>
</br>
Given a symbol <u>THEME</u>, create a new symbol by appending "-theme".</br>
Store this symbol in the `theme-feature' property of <u>THEME</u>.</br>
Calling `provide-theme' to provide <u>THEME</u> actually puts `<u>THEME</u>-theme'</br>
into `features'.</br>
</br>
This allows for a file-name convention for autoloading themes:</br>
Every theme X has a property `provide-theme' whose value is "X-theme".</br>
(load-theme X) then attempts to load the file `X-theme.el'.
