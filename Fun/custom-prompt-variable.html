<strong>custom-prompt-variable</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cus-edit.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(custom-prompt-variable <u>PROMPT-VAR</u> <u>PROMPT-VAL</u> &optional <u>COMMENT</u>)</br>
</br>
Prompt for a variable and a value and return them as a list.</br>
<u>PROMPT-VAR</u> is the prompt for the variable, and <u>PROMPT-VAL</u> is the</br>
prompt for the value.  The %s escape in <u>PROMPT-VAL</u> is replaced with</br>
the name of the variable.</br>
</br>
If the variable has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if</br>
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.</br>
</br>
If the variable has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the</br>
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.</br>
If the variable also has a `custom-get' property, that is used for finding</br>
the current value of the variable, otherwise `symbol-value' is used.</br>

If optional <u>COMMENT</u> argument is non-nil, also prompt for a comment and return</br>
it as the third element in the list.
