<strong>custom-reevaluate-setting</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>custom.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(custom-reevaluate-setting <u>SYMBOL</u>)</br>
</br>
Reset the value of <u>SYMBOL</u> by re-evaluating its saved or standard value.</br>
Use the :set function to do so.  This is useful for customizable options</br>
that are defined before their standard value can really be computed.</br>
E.g. dumped variables whose default depends on run-time information.
