<strong>custom-theme-set-faces</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cus-face.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(custom-theme-set-faces THEME &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Initialize faces for theme THEME.<br/>
The arguments should be a list where each entry has the form:<br/>
<br/>
  (FACE SPEC [NOW [COMMENT]])<br/>
<br/>
SPEC is stored as the saved value for FACE, as well as the value for the<br/>
`user' theme.  The `user' theme is one of the default themes known to Emacs.<br/>
See `custom-known-themes' for more information on the known themes.<br/>
See `custom-theme-set-faces' for more information on the interplay<br/>
between themes and faces.<br/>
See `defface' for the format of SPEC.<br/>
<br/>
If NOW is present and non-nil, FACE is created now, according to SPEC.<br/>
COMMENT is a string comment about FACE.<br/>
<br/>
Several properties of THEME and FACE are used in the process:<br/>
<br/>
If THEME property `theme-immediate' is non-nil, this is equivalent of<br/>
providing the NOW argument to all faces in the argument list: FACE is<br/>
created now.  The only difference is FACE property `force-face': if NOW<br/>
is non-nil, FACE property `force-face' is set to the symbol `rogue', else<br/>
if THEME property `theme-immediate' is non-nil, FACE property `force-face'<br/>
is set to the symbol `immediate'.<br/>
<br/>
SPEC itself is saved in FACE property `saved-face' and it is stored in<br/>
FACE's list property `theme-face' (using `custom-push-theme').
