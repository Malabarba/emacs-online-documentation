<strong>custom-theme-set-faces</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cus-face.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(custom-theme-set-faces <u>THEME</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Apply a list of face specs associated with theme <u>THEME</u>.</br>
<u>THEME</u> should be a theme name (a symbol).  The special theme named</br>
`user' refers to user settings applied via Customize.</br>
</br>
The remaining <u>ARGS</u> should be a list where each entry is a list of</br>
the form:</br>
</br>
  (FACE SPEC [NOW [COMMENT]])</br>
</br>
FACE should be a face name (a symbol).  If FACE is a face alias,</br>
the setting refers to the parent face.</br>
</br>
SPEC should be a face spec.  For details, see `defface'.</br>
</br>
NOW, if present and non-nil, forces the face settings to take</br>
immediate effect in the Emacs display; in particular, FACE is</br>
initialized as a face if it is not yet one.  If NOW is omitted or</br>
nil, the caller is responsible for making the settings take</br>
effect later, by calling `custom-theme-recalc-face' or</br>
`face-spec-recalc'.</br>
</br>
COMMENT is a string comment about FACE.</br>
</br>
This function works by calling `custom-push-theme' to record each</br>
SPEC in each FACE's `theme-face' property, and in <u>THEME</u>'s</br>
`theme-settings' property.  If FACE has not already been</br>
customized, it also stores SPEC in the `saved-face' property.</br>
</br>
If <u>THEME</u> has a non-nil `theme-immediate' property, this is</br>
equivalent to providing the NOW argument to all faces in the</br>
argument list.
