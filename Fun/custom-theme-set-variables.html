<strong>custom-theme-set-variables</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>custom.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(custom-theme-set-variables <u>THEME</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Initialize variables for theme <u>THEME</u> according to settings in <u>ARGS</u>.</br>
Each of the arguments in <u>ARGS</u> should be a list of this form:</br>
</br>
  (SYMBOL EXP [NOW [REQUEST [COMMENT]]])</br>
</br>
SYMBOL is the variable name, and EXP is an expression which</br>
evaluates to the customized value.  EXP will also be stored,</br>
without evaluating it, in SYMBOL's `saved-value' property, so</br>
that it can be restored via the Customize interface.  It is also</br>
added to the alist in SYMBOL's `theme-value' property (by</br>
calling `custom-push-theme').</br>
</br>
NOW, if present and non-nil, means to install the variable's</br>
value directly now, even if its `defcustom' declaration has not</br>
been executed.  This is for internal use only.</br>
</br>
REQUEST is a list of features to `require' (which are loaded</br>
prior to evaluating EXP).</br>
</br>
COMMENT is a comment string about SYMBOL.
