<br/>
Set VARIABLE to VALUE, and return VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.<br/>

it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.<br/>
<br/>
If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the<br/>
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.<br/>
