<strong>cvs-add-secondary-branch-prefix</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cvs-add-secondary-branch-prefix FLAGS &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Add branch selection argument if the secondary branch prefix was set.<br/>
The argument is added (or not) to the list of FLAGS and is constructed<br/>
by appending the branch to ARG which defaults to "-r".<br/>
Since the `cvs-secondary-branch-prefix' is only active if the primary<br/>
prefix is active, it is important to read the secondary prefix before<br/>
the primary since reading the primary can deactivate it.
