<strong>cvs-add-secondary-branch-prefix</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cvs-add-secondary-branch-prefix <u>FLAGS</u> &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Add branch selection argument if the secondary branch prefix was set.</br>
The argument is added (or not) to the list of <u>FLAGS</u> and is constructed</br>
by appending the branch to <u>ARG</u> which defaults to "-r".</br>
Since the `cvs-secondary-branch-prefix' is only active if the primary</br>
prefix is active, it is important to read the secondary prefix before</br>
the primary since reading the primary can deactivate it.
