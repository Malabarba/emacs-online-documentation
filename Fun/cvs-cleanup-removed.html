<strong>cvs-cleanup-removed</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(cvs-cleanup-removed <u>FI</u>)</br>
</br>
Non-nil if <u>FI</u> has been cvs-removed but still exists.</br>
This is intended for use on `cvs-cleanup-functions' when you have cvs-removed</br>
automatically generated files (which should hence not be under CVS control)</br>
but can't commit the removal because the repository's owner doesn't understand</br>
the problem.
