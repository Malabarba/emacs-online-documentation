<strong>cvs-get-buffer-create</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cvs-get-buffer-create NAME &optional NOREUSE)<br/>
<br/>
Create a buffer NAME unless such a buffer already exists.<br/>
If the NAME looks like an absolute file name, the buffer will be created<br/>
with `create-file-buffer' and will probably get another name than NAME.<br/>
In such a case, the search for another buffer with the same name doesn't<br/>
use the buffer name but the buffer's `list-buffers-directory' variable.<br/>
If NOREUSE is non-nil, always return a new buffer.
