<strong>cvs-mode-do</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cvs-mode-do CMD FLAGS FILTER &key SHOW DONT-CHANGE-DISC CVSARGS POSTPROC)<br/>
<br/>
Generic cvs-mode-<foo> function.<br/>
Executes `cvs CVSARGS CMD FLAGS' on the selected files.<br/>
FILTER is passed to `cvs-applicable-p' to only apply the command to<br/>
  files for which it makes sense.<br/>
SHOW indicates that CMD should be not be run in the default temp buffer and<br/>
  should be shown to the user.  The buffer and mode to be used is determined<br/>
  by `cvs-buffer-name-alist'.<br/>
DONT-CHANGE-DISC non-nil indicates that the command will not change the<br/>
  contents of files.  This is only used by the parser.
