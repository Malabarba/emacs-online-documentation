<strong>cvs-mode-force-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(cvs-mode-force-command <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Force the next cvs command to operate on all the selected files.</br>
By default, cvs commands only operate on files on which the command</br>
"makes sense".  This overrides the safety feature on the next cvs command.</br>
It actually behaves as a toggle.  If prefixed by C-u C-u,</br>
the override will persist until the next toggle.
