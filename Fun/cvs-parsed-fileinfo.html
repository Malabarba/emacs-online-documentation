<strong>cvs-parsed-fileinfo</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcvs-parse.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cvs-parsed-fileinfo TYPE PATH &optional DIRECTORY &rest KEYS)<br/>
<br/>
Create a fileinfo.<br/>
TYPE can either be a type symbol or a cons of the form (TYPE . SUBTYPE).<br/>
PATH is the filename.<br/>
DIRECTORY influences the way PATH is interpreted:<br/>
- if it's a string, it denotes the directory in which PATH (which should then be<br/>
  a plain file name with no directory component) resides.<br/>
- if it's nil, the PATH should not be trusted: if it has a directory<br/>
  component, use it, else, assume it is relative to the current directory.<br/>
- else, the PATH should be trusted to be relative to the root<br/>
  directory (i.e. if there is no directory component, it means the file<br/>
  is inside the main directory).<br/>
The remaining KEYS are passed directly to `cvs-create-fileinfo'.
