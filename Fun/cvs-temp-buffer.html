cvs-temp-buffer is a compiled Lisp function in `pcvs.el'.<br/><br/>(cvs-temp-buffer &optional CMD NORMAL NOSETUP)<br/><br/>Create a temporary buffer to run CMD in.<br/>If CMD is a string, use it to lookup `cvs-buffer-name-alist' to find<br/>the buffer name to be used and its `major-mode'.<br/><br/>The selected window will not be changed.  The new buffer will not maintain undo<br/>information and will be read-only unless NORMAL is non-nil.  It will be emptied<br/>(unless NOSETUP is non-nil) and its `default-directory' will be inherited<br/>from the current buffer.
