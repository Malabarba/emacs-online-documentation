</br>
Print the tree of <u>TAGS</u> where each tag's string is given by <u>PRINTER</u>.</br>
<u>PRINTER</u> should accept both a tag (in which case it should return a string)</br>
or a string (in which case it should simply return its argument).</br>
A tag cannot be a CONS.  The return value can also be a list of strings,</br>
if several nodes where merged into one.</br>
The tree will be printed no closer than column <u>COLUMN</u>.
