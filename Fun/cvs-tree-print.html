<strong>cvs-tree-print</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>cvs-status.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(cvs-tree-print TAGS PRINTER COLUMN)<br/>
<br/>
Print the tree of TAGS where each tag's string is given by PRINTER.<br/>
PRINTER should accept both a tag (in which case it should return a string)<br/>
or a string (in which case it should simply return its argument).<br/>
A tag cannot be a CONS.  The return value can also be a list of strings,<br/>
if several nodes where merged into one.<br/>
The tree will be printed no closer than column COLUMN.
