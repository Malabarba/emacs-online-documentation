<strong>cycle-spacing</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(cycle-spacing &optional <u>N</u> <u>PRESERVE-NL-BACK</u> <u>SINGLE-SHOT</u>)</br>
</br>
Manipulate whitespace around point in a smart way.</br>
In interactive use, this function behaves differently in successive</br>
consecutive calls.</br>
</br>
The first call in a sequence acts like `just-one-space'.</br>
It deletes all spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space</br>
(or <u>N</u> spaces).  <u>N</u> is the prefix argument.  If <u>N</u> is negative,</br>
it deletes newlines as well, leaving -<u>N</u> spaces.</br>
(If <u>PRESERVE-NL-BACK</u> is non-nil, it does not delete newlines before point.)</br>
</br>
The second call in a sequence (or the first call if the above does</br>
not result in any changes) deletes all spaces.</br>
</br>
The third call in a sequence restores the original whitespace (and point).</br>
</br>
If <u>SINGLE-SHOT</u> is non-nil, it only performs the first step in the sequence.
