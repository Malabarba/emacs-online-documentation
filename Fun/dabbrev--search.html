<strong>dabbrev--search</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dabbrev.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dabbrev--search ABBREV REVERSE IGNORE-CASE)<br/>
<br/>
Search for something that could be used to expand ABBREV.<br/>
<br/>
Second arg, REVERSE, is t for reverse search, nil for forward.<br/>
The variable `dabbrev-limit' controls the maximum search region size.<br/>
Third argument IGNORE-CASE non-nil means treat case as insignificant while<br/>
looking for a match and when comparing with previous matches.  Also if<br/>
that's non-nil and the match is found at the beginning of a sentence<br/>
and is in lower case except for the initial then it is converted to<br/>
all lower case for return.<br/>
<br/>
Table of expansions already seen is examined in buffer<br/>
`dabbrev--last-table' so that only distinct possibilities are found<br/>
by dabbrev-re-expand.<br/>
<br/>
Returns the expansion found, or nil if not found.<br/>
Leaves point at the location of the start of the expansion.
