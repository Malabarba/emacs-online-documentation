dabbrev-expand is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `dabbrev.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to M-/.<br/><br/>(dabbrev-expand ARG)<br/><br/>Expand previous word "dynamically".<br/><br/>Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.<br/>If no suitable preceding word is found, words following point are<br/>considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the<br/>buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable<br/>`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'.<br/><br/>A positive prefix argument, N, says to take the Nth backward *distinct*<br/>possibility.  A negative argument says search forward.<br/><br/>If the cursor has not moved from the end of the previous expansion and<br/>no argument is given, replace the previously-made expansion<br/>with the next possible expansion not yet tried.<br/><br/>The variable `dabbrev-backward-only' may be used to limit the<br/>direction of search to backward if set non-nil.<br/><br/>See also `dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp' and C-M-/.
