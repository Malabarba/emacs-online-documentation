</br>
BUS identifies the D-Bus the message is coming from.  It is</br>
either a Lisp symbol, `:system' or `:session', or a string</br>
denoting the bus address.  TYPE is the D-Bus message type which</br>
has caused the event, SERIAL is the serial number of the received</br>
D-Bus message.  SERVICE and PATH are the unique name and the</br>
object path of the D-Bus object emitting the message.  INTERFACE</br>
and MEMBER denote the message which has been sent.  HANDLER is</br>
the function which has been registered for this message.  ARGS</br>
are the arguments passed to HANDLER, when it is called during</br>
event handling in `dbus-handle-event'.</br>
</br>
This function raises a `dbus-error' signal in case the event is</br>
not well formed.
