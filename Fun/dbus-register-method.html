dbus-register-method is a compiled Lisp function in `dbus.el'.<br/><br/>(dbus-register-method BUS SERVICE PATH INTERFACE METHOD HANDLER &optional DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE)<br/><br/>Register for method METHOD on the D-Bus BUS.<br/><br/>BUS is either a Lisp symbol, `:system' or `:session', or a string<br/>denoting the bus address.<br/><br/>SERVICE is the D-Bus service name of the D-Bus object METHOD is<br/>registered for.  It must be a known name (See discussion of<br/>DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE below).<br/><br/>PATH is the D-Bus object path SERVICE is registered (See discussion of<br/>DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE below).  INTERFACE is the interface offered by<br/>SERVICE.  It must provide METHOD.<br/><br/>HANDLER is a Lisp function to be called when a method call is<br/>received.  It must accept the input arguments of METHOD.  The return<br/>value of HANDLER is used for composing the returning D-Bus message.<br/>In case HANDLER shall return a reply message with an empty argument<br/>list, HANDLER must return the symbol `:ignore'.<br/><br/>When DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE is non-nil, the known name SERVICE is not<br/>registered.  This means that other D-Bus clients have no way of<br/>noticing the newly registered method.  When interfaces are constructed<br/>incrementally by adding single methods or properties at a time,<br/>DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE can be used to prevent other clients from<br/>discovering the still incomplete interface.
