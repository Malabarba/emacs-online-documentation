<strong>dbus-register-property</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dbus.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dbus-register-property BUS SERVICE PATH INTERFACE PROPERTY ACCESS VALUE &optional EMITS-SIGNAL DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE)<br/>
<br/>
Register property PROPERTY on the D-Bus BUS.<br/>
<br/>
BUS is either a Lisp symbol, `:system' or `:session', or a string<br/>
denoting the bus address.<br/>
<br/>
SERVICE is the D-Bus service name of the D-Bus.  It must be a<br/>
known name (See discussion of DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE below).<br/>
<br/>
PATH is the D-Bus object path SERVICE is registered (See<br/>
discussion of DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE below).  INTERFACE is the<br/>
name of the interface used at PATH, PROPERTY is the name of the<br/>
property of INTERFACE.  ACCESS indicates, whether the property<br/>
can be changed by other services via D-Bus.  It must be either<br/>
the symbol `:read' or `:readwrite'.  VALUE is the initial value<br/>
of the property, it can be of any valid type (see<br/>
`dbus-call-method' for details).<br/>
<br/>
If PROPERTY already exists on PATH, it will be overwritten.  For<br/>
properties with access type `:read' this is the only way to<br/>
change their values.  Properties with access type `:readwrite'<br/>
can be changed by `dbus-set-property'.<br/>
<br/>
The interface "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" is added to<br/>
PATH, including a default handler for the "Get", "GetAll" and<br/>
"Set" methods of this interface.  When EMITS-SIGNAL is non-nil,<br/>
the signal "PropertiesChanged" is sent when the property is<br/>
changed by `dbus-set-property'.<br/>
<br/>
When DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE is non-nil, the known name SERVICE is<br/>
not registered.  This means that other D-Bus clients have no way<br/>
of noticing the newly registered property.  When interfaces are<br/>
constructed incrementally by adding single methods or properties<br/>
at a time, DONT-REGISTER-SERVICE can be used to prevent other<br/>
clients from discovering the still incomplete interface.
