<strong>debug-on-entry</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>debug.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(debug-on-entry <u>FUNCTION</u>)</br>
</br>
Request <u>FUNCTION</u> to invoke debugger each time it is called.</br>
</br>
When called interactively, prompt for <u>FUNCTION</u> in the minibuffer.</br>
</br>
This works by modifying the definition of <u>FUNCTION</u>.  If you tell the</br>
debugger to continue, <u>FUNCTION</u>'s execution proceeds.  If <u>FUNCTION</u> is a</br>
normal function or a macro written in Lisp, you can also step through</br>
its execution.  <u>FUNCTION</u> can also be a primitive that is not a special</br>
form, in which case stepping is not possible.  Break-on-entry for</br>
primitive functions only works when that function is called from Lisp.</br>
</br>
Use M-x cancel-debug-on-entry to cancel the effect of this command.</br>
Redefining <u>FUNCTION</u> also cancels it.
