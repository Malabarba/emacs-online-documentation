debug-on-entry is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `debug.el'.<br/><br/>(debug-on-entry FUNCTION)<br/><br/>Request FUNCTION to invoke debugger each time it is called.<br/><br/>When called interactively, prompt for FUNCTION in the minibuffer.<br/><br/>This works by modifying the definition of FUNCTION.  If you tell the<br/>debugger to continue, FUNCTION's execution proceeds.  If FUNCTION is a<br/>normal function or a macro written in Lisp, you can also step through<br/>its execution.  FUNCTION can also be a primitive that is not a special<br/>form, in which case stepping is not possible.  Break-on-entry for<br/>primitive functions only works when that function is called from Lisp.<br/><br/>Use M-x cancel-debug-on-entry to cancel the effect of this command.<br/>Redefining FUNCTION also cancels it.
