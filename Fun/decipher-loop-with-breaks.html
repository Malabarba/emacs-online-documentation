<strong>decipher-loop-with-breaks</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>decipher.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(decipher-loop-with-breaks <u>FUNC</u>)</br>
</br>
Loop through ciphertext, calling <u>FUNC</u> once for each letter & word division.</br>
</br>
<u>FUNC</u> is called with no arguments, and its return value is unimportant.</br>
It may examine `decipher-char' to see the current ciphertext</br>
character.  `decipher-char' contains either an uppercase letter or a space.</br>
</br>
<u>FUNC</u> is called exactly once between words, with `decipher-char' set to</br>
a space.</br>

See `decipher-loop-no-breaks' if you do not care about word divisions.
