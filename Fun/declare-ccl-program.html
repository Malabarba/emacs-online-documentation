<strong>declare-ccl-program</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>ccl.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(declare-ccl-program <u>NAME</u> &optional <u>VECTOR</u>)</br>
</br>
Declare <u>NAME</u> as a name of CCL program.</br>
</br>
This macro exists for backward compatibility.  In the old version of</br>
Emacs, to compile a CCL program which calls another CCL program not</br>
yet defined, it must be declared as a CCL program in advance.  But,</br>
now CCL program names are resolved not at compile time but before</br>
execution.</br>
</br>
Optional arg <u>VECTOR</u> is a compiled CCL code of the CCL program.
