<strong>declare-ccl-program</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>ccl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(declare-ccl-program NAME &optional VECTOR)<br/>
<br/>
Declare NAME as a name of CCL program.<br/>
<br/>
This macro exists for backward compatibility.  In the old version of<br/>
Emacs, to compile a CCL program which calls another CCL program not<br/>
yet defined, it must be declared as a CCL program in advance.  But,<br/>
now CCL program names are resolved not at compile time but before<br/>
execution.<br/>
<br/>
Optional arg VECTOR is a compiled CCL code of the CCL program.
