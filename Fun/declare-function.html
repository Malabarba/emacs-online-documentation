<strong>declare-function</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(declare-function FN FILE &optional ARGLIST FILEONLY)<br/>
<br/>
Tell the byte-compiler that function FN is defined, in FILE.<br/>
Optional ARGLIST is the argument list used by the function.  The<br/>
FILE argument is not used by the byte-compiler, but by the<br/>
`check-declare' package, which checks that FILE contains a<br/>
definition for FN.  ARGLIST is used by both the byte-compiler and<br/>
`check-declare' to check for consistency.<br/>
<br/>
FILE can be either a Lisp file (in which case the ".el"<br/>
extension is optional), or a C file.  C files are expanded<br/>
relative to the Emacs "src/" directory.  Lisp files are<br/>
searched for using `locate-library', and if that fails they are<br/>
expanded relative to the location of the file containing the<br/>
declaration.  A FILE with an "ext:" prefix is an external file.<br/>
`check-declare' will check such files if they are found, and skip<br/>
them without error if they are not.<br/>
<br/>
FILEONLY non-nil means that `check-declare' will only check that<br/>
FILE exists, not that it defines FN.  This is intended for<br/>
function-definitions that `check-declare' does not recognize, e.g.<br/>
`defstruct'.<br/>
<br/>
To specify a value for FILEONLY without passing an argument list,<br/>
set ARGLIST to t.  This is necessary because nil means an<br/>
empty argument list, rather than an unspecified one.<br/>
<br/>
Note that for the purposes of `check-declare', this statement<br/>
must be the first non-whitespace on a line.<br/>
