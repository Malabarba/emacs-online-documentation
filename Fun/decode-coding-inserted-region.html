<strong>decode-coding-inserted-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(decode-coding-inserted-region FROM TO FILENAME &optional VISIT BEG END REPLACE)<br/>
<br/>
Decode the region between FROM and TO as if it is read from file FILENAME.<br/>
The idea is that the text between FROM and TO was just inserted somehow.<br/>
Optional arguments VISIT, BEG, END, and REPLACE are the same as those<br/>
of the function `insert-file-contents'.<br/>
Part of the job of this function is setting `buffer-undo-list' appropriately.
