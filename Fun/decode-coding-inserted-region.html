<strong>decode-coding-inserted-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(decode-coding-inserted-region <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u> <u>FILENAME</u> &optional <u>VISIT</u> <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> <u>REPLACE</u>)</br>
</br>
Decode the region between <u>FROM</u> and <u>TO</u> as if it is read from file <u>FILENAME</u>.</br>
The idea is that the text between <u>FROM</u> and <u>TO</u> was just inserted somehow.</br>
Optional arguments <u>VISIT</u>, <u>BEG</u>, <u>END</u>, and <u>REPLACE</u> are the same as those</br>
of the function `insert-file-contents'.</br>
Part of the job of this function is setting `buffer-undo-list' appropriately.
