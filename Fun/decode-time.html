<strong>decode-time</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(decode-time &optional <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u>)</br>
</br>
Decode a time value as (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE).</br>
The optional <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u> should be a list of (HIGH LOW . IGNORED),</br>
as from `current-time' and `file-attributes', or nil to use the</br>
current time.  The obsolete form (HIGH . LOW) is also still accepted.</br>
The list has the following nine members: SEC is an integer between 0</br>
and 60; SEC is 60 for a leap second, which only some operating systems</br>
support.  MINUTE is an integer between 0 and 59.  HOUR is an integer</br>
between 0 and 23.  DAY is an integer between 1 and 31.  MONTH is an</br>
integer between 1 and 12.  YEAR is an integer indicating the</br>
four-digit year.  DOW is the day of week, an integer between 0 and 6,</br>
where 0 is Sunday.  DST is t if daylight saving time is in effect,</br>
otherwise nil.  ZONE is an integer indicating the number of seconds</br>
east of Greenwich.  (Note that Common Lisp has different meanings for</br>
DOW and ZONE.)
