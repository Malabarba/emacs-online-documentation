def-gdb-auto-update-trigger is a Lisp macro in `gdb-mi.el'.<br/><br/>(def-gdb-auto-update-trigger TRIGGER-NAME GDB-COMMAND HANDLER-NAME &optional SIGNAL-LIST)<br/><br/>Define a trigger TRIGGER-NAME which sends GDB-COMMAND and sets<br/>HANDLER-NAME as its handler. HANDLER-NAME is bound to current<br/>buffer with `gdb-bind-function-to-buffer'.<br/><br/>If SIGNAL-LIST is non-nil, GDB-COMMAND is sent only when the<br/>defined trigger is called with an argument from SIGNAL-LIST. It's<br/>not recommended to define triggers with empty SIGNAL-LIST.<br/>Normally triggers should respond at least to 'update signal.<br/><br/>Normally the trigger defined by this command must be called from<br/>the buffer where HANDLER-NAME must work. This should be done so<br/>that buffer-local thread number may be used in GDB-COMMAND (by<br/>calling `gdb-current-context-command').<br/>`gdb-bind-function-to-buffer' is used to achieve this, see<br/>`gdb-get-buffer-create'.<br/><br/>Triggers defined by this command are meant to be used as a<br/>trigger argument when describing buffer types with<br/>`gdb-set-buffer-rules'.
