<strong>def-gdb-auto-update-trigger</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>gdb-mi.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(def-gdb-auto-update-trigger <u>TRIGGER-NAME</u> <u>GDB-COMMAND</u> <u>HANDLER-NAME</u> &optional <u>SIGNAL-LIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Define a trigger <u>TRIGGER-NAME</u> which sends <u>GDB-COMMAND</u> and sets</br>
<u>HANDLER-NAME</u> as its handler.  <u>HANDLER-NAME</u> is bound to current</br>
buffer with `gdb-bind-function-to-buffer'.</br>
</br>
If <u>SIGNAL-LIST</u> is non-nil, <u>GDB-COMMAND</u> is sent only when the</br>
defined trigger is called with an argument from <u>SIGNAL-LIST</u>.  It's</br>
not recommended to define triggers with empty <u>SIGNAL-LIST</u>.</br>
Normally triggers should respond at least to 'update signal.</br>
</br>
Normally the trigger defined by this command must be called from</br>
the buffer where <u>HANDLER-NAME</u> must work.  This should be done so</br>
that buffer-local thread number may be used in <u>GDB-COMMAND</u> (by</br>
calling `gdb-current-context-command').</br>
`gdb-bind-function-to-buffer' is used to achieve this, see</br>
`gdb-get-buffer-create'.</br>
</br>
Triggers defined by this command are meant to be used as a</br>
trigger argument when describing buffer types with</br>
`gdb-set-buffer-rules'.
