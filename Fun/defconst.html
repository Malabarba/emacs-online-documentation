defconst is a special form in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(defconst SYMBOL INITVALUE [DOCSTRING])<br/><br/>Define SYMBOL as a constant variable.<br/>This declares that neither programs nor users should ever change the<br/>value.  This constancy is not actually enforced by Emacs Lisp, but<br/>SYMBOL is marked as a special variable so that it is never lexically<br/>bound.<br/><br/>The `defconst' form always sets the value of SYMBOL to the result of<br/>evalling INITVALUE.  If SYMBOL is buffer-local, its default value is<br/>what is set; buffer-local values are not affected.  If SYMBOL has a<br/>local binding, then this form sets the local binding's value.<br/>However, you should normally not make local bindings for variables<br/>defined with this form.<br/><br/>The optional DOCSTRING specifies the variable's documentation string.
