defcustom is a Lisp macro in `custom.el'.<br/><br/>(defcustom SYMBOL STANDARD DOC &rest ARGS)<br/><br/>Declare SYMBOL as a customizable variable.<br/>SYMBOL is the variable name; it should not be quoted.<br/>STANDARD is an expression specifying the variable's standard<br/>value.  It should not be quoted.  It is evaluated once by<br/>`defcustom', and the value is assigned to SYMBOL if the variable<br/>is unbound.  The expression itself is also stored, so that<br/>Customize can re-evaluate it later to get the standard value.<br/>DOC is the variable documentation.<br/><br/>This macro uses `defvar' as a subroutine, which also marks the<br/>variable as "special", so that it is always dynamically bound<br/>even when `lexical-binding' is t.<br/><br/>The remaining arguments to `defcustom' should have the form<br/><br/>   [KEYWORD VALUE]...<br/><br/>The following keywords are meaningful:<br/><br/>:type	VALUE should be a widget type for editing the symbol's value.<br/>:options VALUE should be a list of valid members of the widget type.<br/>:initialize<br/>	VALUE should be a function used to initialize the<br/>	variable.  It takes two arguments, the symbol and value<br/>	given in the `defcustom' call.  The default is<br/>	`custom-initialize-reset'.<br/>:set	VALUE should be a function to set the value of the symbol<br/>        when using the Customize user interface.<br/>	It takes two arguments, the symbol to set and the value to<br/>	give it.  The default choice of function is `set-default'.<br/>:get	VALUE should be a function to extract the value of symbol.<br/>	The function takes one argument, a symbol, and should return<br/>	the current value for that symbol.  The default choice of function<br/>	is `default-value'.<br/>:require<br/>	VALUE should be a feature symbol.  If you save a value<br/>	for this option, then when your init file loads the value,<br/>	it does (require VALUE) first.<br/>:set-after VARIABLES<br/>	Specifies that SYMBOL should be set after the list of variables<br/>        VARIABLES when both have been customized.<br/>:risky	Set SYMBOL's `risky-local-variable' property to VALUE.<br/>:safe	Set SYMBOL's `safe-local-variable' property to VALUE.<br/>        See Info node `(elisp) File Local Variables'.<br/><br/>The following common keywords are also meaningful.<br/><br/>:group  VALUE should be a customization group.<br/>        Add SYMBOL (or FACE with `defface') to that group.<br/>:link LINK-DATA<br/>        Include an external link after the documentation string for this<br/>        item.  This is a sentence containing an active field which<br/>        references some other documentation.<br/><br/>        There are several alternatives you can use for LINK-DATA:<br/><br/>        (custom-manual INFO-NODE)<br/>             Link to an Info node; INFO-NODE is a string which specifies<br/>             the node name, as in "(emacs)Top".<br/><br/>        (info-link INFO-NODE)<br/>             Like `custom-manual' except that the link appears in the<br/>             customization buffer with the Info node name.<br/><br/>        (url-link URL)<br/>             Link to a web page; URL is a string which specifies the URL.<br/><br/>        (emacs-commentary-link LIBRARY)<br/>             Link to the commentary section of LIBRARY.<br/><br/>        (emacs-library-link LIBRARY)<br/>             Link to an Emacs Lisp LIBRARY file.<br/><br/>        (file-link FILE)<br/>             Link to FILE.<br/><br/>        (function-link FUNCTION)<br/>             Link to the documentation of FUNCTION.<br/><br/>        (variable-link VARIABLE)<br/>             Link to the documentation of VARIABLE.<br/><br/>        (custom-group-link GROUP)<br/>             Link to another customization GROUP.<br/><br/>        You can specify the text to use in the customization buffer by<br/>        adding `:tag NAME' after the first element of the LINK-DATA; for<br/>        example, (info-link :tag "foo" "(emacs)Top") makes a link to the<br/>        Emacs manual which appears in the buffer as `foo'.<br/><br/>        An item can have more than one external link; however, most items<br/>        have none at all.<br/>:version<br/>        VALUE should be a string specifying that the variable was<br/>        first introduced, or its default value was changed, in Emacs<br/>        version VERSION.<br/>:package-version<br/>        VALUE should be a list with the form (PACKAGE . VERSION)<br/>        specifying that the variable was first introduced, or its<br/>        default value was changed, in PACKAGE version VERSION.  This<br/>        keyword takes priority over :version.  The PACKAGE and VERSION<br/>        must appear in the alist `customize-package-emacs-version-alist'.<br/>        Since PACKAGE must be unique and the user might see it in an<br/>        error message, a good choice is the official name of the<br/>        package, such as MH-E or Gnus.<br/>:tag LABEL<br/>        Use LABEL, a string, instead of the item's name, to label the item<br/>        in customization menus and buffers.<br/>:load FILE<br/>        Load file FILE (a string) before displaying this customization<br/>        item.  Loading is done with `load', and only if the file is<br/>        not already loaded.<br/><br/>If SYMBOL has a local binding, then this form affects the local<br/>binding.  This is normally not what you want.  Thus, if you need<br/>to load a file defining variables with this form, or with<br/>`defvar' or `defconst', you should always load that file<br/>_outside_ any bindings for these variables.  (`defvar' and<br/>`defconst' behave similarly in this respect.)<br/><br/>See Info node `(elisp) Customization' in the Emacs Lisp manual<br/>for more information.
