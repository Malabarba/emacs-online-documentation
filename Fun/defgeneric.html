<strong>defgeneric</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>eieio.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(defgeneric <u>METHOD</u> <u>ARGS</u> &optional <u>DOC-STRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Create a generic function <u>METHOD</u>.</br>
<u>DOC-STRING</u> is the base documentation for this class.  A generic</br>
function has no body, as its purpose is to decide which method body</br>
is appropriate to use.  Uses `defmethod' to create methods, and calls</br>
`defgeneric' for you.  With this implementation the <u>ARGS</u> are</br>
currently ignored.  You can use `defgeneric' to apply specialized</br>
top level documentation to a method.
