define-abbrev-table is a compiled Lisp function in `abbrev.el'.<br/><br/>(define-abbrev-table TABLENAME DEFINITIONS &optional DOCSTRING &rest PROPS)<br/><br/>Define TABLENAME (a symbol) as an abbrev table name.<br/>Define abbrevs in it according to DEFINITIONS, which is a list of elements<br/>of the form (ABBREVNAME EXPANSION ...) that are passed to `define-abbrev'.<br/>PROPS is a property list to apply to the table.<br/>Properties with special meaning:<br/>- `:parents' contains a list of abbrev tables from which this table inherits<br/>  abbreviations.<br/>- `:case-fixed' non-nil means that abbreviations are looked up without<br/>  case-folding, and the expansion is not capitalized/upcased.<br/>- `:regexp' is a regular expression that specifies how to extract the<br/>  name of the abbrev before point.  The submatch 1 is treated<br/>  as the potential name of an abbrev.  If :regexp is nil, the default<br/>  behavior uses `backward-word' and `forward-word' to extract the name<br/>  of the abbrev, which can therefore only be a single word.<br/>- `:enable-function' can be set to a function of no argument which returns<br/>  non-nil if and only if the abbrevs in this table should be used for this<br/>  instance of `expand-abbrev'.
