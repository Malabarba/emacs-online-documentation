define-abbrev is a compiled Lisp function in `abbrev.el'.<br/><br/>(define-abbrev TABLE NAME EXPANSION &optional HOOK &rest PROPS)<br/><br/>Define an abbrev in TABLE named NAME, to expand to EXPANSION and call HOOK.<br/>NAME must be a string, and should be lower-case.<br/>EXPANSION should usually be a string.<br/>To undefine an abbrev, define it with EXPANSION = nil.<br/>If HOOK is non-nil, it should be a function of no arguments;<br/>it is called after EXPANSION is inserted.<br/>If EXPANSION is not a string (and not nil), the abbrev is a<br/> special one, which does not expand in the usual way but only<br/> runs HOOK.<br/><br/>If HOOK is a non-nil symbol with a non-nil `no-self-insert' property,<br/>it can control whether the character that triggered abbrev expansion<br/>is inserted.  If such a HOOK returns non-nil, the character is not<br/>inserted.  If such a HOOK returns nil, then so does `abbrev-insert'<br/>(and `expand-abbrev'), as if no abbrev expansion had taken place.<br/><br/>PROPS is a property list.  The following properties are special:<br/>- `:count': the value for the abbrev's usage-count, which is incremented each<br/>  time the abbrev is used (the default is zero).<br/>- `:system': if non-nil, says that this is a "system" abbreviation<br/>  which should not be saved in the user's abbreviation file.<br/>  Unless `:system' is `force', a system abbreviation will not<br/>  overwrite a non-system abbreviation of the same name.<br/>- `:case-fixed': non-nil means that abbreviations are looked up without<br/>  case-folding, and the expansion is not capitalized/upcased.<br/>- `:enable-function': a function of no argument which returns non-nil if the<br/>  abbrev should be used for a particular call of `expand-abbrev'.<br/><br/>An obsolete but still supported calling form is:<br/><br/>(define-abbrev TABLE NAME EXPANSION &optional HOOK COUNT SYSTEM).
