<br/>
Define a compiler-only macro.<br/>
This is like `defmacro', but macro expansion occurs only if the call to<br/>
FUNC is compiled (i.e., not interpreted).  Compiler macros should be used<br/>
for optimizing the way calls to FUNC are compiled; the form returned by<br/>
BODY should do the same thing as a call to the normal function called<br/>
FUNC, though possibly more efficiently.  Note that, like regular macros,<br/>
compiler macros are expanded repeatedly until no further expansions are<br/>
possible.  Unlike regular macros, BODY can decide to "punt" and leave the<br/>
original function call alone by declaring an initial `&whole foo' parameter<br/>
and then returning foo.
