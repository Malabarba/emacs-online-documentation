<strong>define-derived-mode</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>derived.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-derived-mode CHILD PARENT NAME &optional DOCSTRING &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Create a new mode as a variant of an existing mode.<br/>
<br/>
The arguments to this command are as follow:<br/>
<br/>
CHILD:     the name of the command for the derived mode.<br/>
PARENT:    the name of the command for the parent mode (e.g. `text-mode')<br/>
           or nil if there is no parent.<br/>
NAME:      a string which will appear in the status line (e.g. "Hypertext")<br/>
DOCSTRING: an optional documentation string--if you do not supply one,<br/>
           the function will attempt to invent something useful.<br/>
BODY:      forms to execute just before running the<br/>
           hooks for the new mode.  Do not use `interactive' here.<br/>
<br/>
BODY can start with a bunch of keyword arguments.  The following keyword<br/>
  arguments are currently understood:<br/>
:group GROUP<br/>
	Declare the customization group that corresponds to this mode.<br/>
	The command `customize-mode' uses this.<br/>
:syntax-table TABLE<br/>
	Use TABLE instead of the default (CHILD-syntax-table).<br/>
	A nil value means to simply use the same syntax-table as the parent.<br/>
:abbrev-table TABLE<br/>
	Use TABLE instead of the default (CHILD-abbrev-table).<br/>
	A nil value means to simply use the same abbrev-table as the parent.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how you could define LaTeX-Thesis mode as a variant of LaTeX mode:<br/>
<br/>
  (define-derived-mode LaTeX-thesis-mode LaTeX-mode "LaTeX-Thesis")<br/>
<br/>
You could then make new key bindings for `LaTeX-thesis-mode-map'<br/>
without changing regular LaTeX mode.  In this example, BODY is empty,<br/>
and DOCSTRING is generated by default.<br/>
<br/>
On a more complicated level, the following command uses `sgml-mode' as<br/>
the parent, and then sets the variable `case-fold-search' to nil:<br/>
<br/>
  (define-derived-mode article-mode sgml-mode "Article"<br/>
    "Major mode for editing technical articles."<br/>
    (setq case-fold-search nil))<br/>
<br/>
Note that if the documentation string had been left out, it would have<br/>
been generated automatically, with a reference to the keymap.<br/>
<br/>
The new mode runs the hook constructed by the function<br/>
`derived-mode-hook-name'.<br/>
