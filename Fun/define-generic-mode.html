<strong>define-generic-mode</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>generic.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-generic-mode MODE COMMENT-LIST KEYWORD-LIST FONT-LOCK-LIST AUTO-MODE-LIST FUNCTION-LIST &optional DOCSTRING)<br/>
<br/>
Create a new generic mode MODE.<br/>
<br/>
MODE is the name of the command for the generic mode; don't quote it.<br/>
The optional DOCSTRING is the documentation for the mode command.  If<br/>
you do not supply it, `define-generic-mode' uses a default<br/>
documentation string instead.<br/>
<br/>
COMMENT-LIST is a list in which each element is either a character, a<br/>
string of one or two characters, or a cons cell.  A character or a<br/>
string is set up in the mode's syntax table as a "comment starter".<br/>
If the entry is a cons cell, the `car' is set up as a "comment<br/>
starter" and the `cdr' as a "comment ender".  (Use nil for the<br/>
latter if you want comments to end at the end of the line.)  Note that<br/>
the syntax table has limitations about what comment starters and<br/>
enders are actually possible.<br/>
<br/>
KEYWORD-LIST is a list of keywords to highlight with<br/>
`font-lock-keyword-face'.  Each keyword should be a string.<br/>
<br/>
FONT-LOCK-LIST is a list of additional expressions to highlight.  Each<br/>
element of this list should have the same form as an element of<br/>
`font-lock-keywords'.<br/>
<br/>
AUTO-MODE-LIST is a list of regular expressions to add to<br/>
`auto-mode-alist'.  These regular expressions are added when Emacs<br/>
runs the macro expansion.<br/>
<br/>
FUNCTION-LIST is a list of functions to call to do some additional<br/>
setup.  The mode command calls these functions just before it runs the<br/>
mode hook `MODE-hook'.<br/>

See the file generic-x.el for some examples of `define-generic-mode'.
