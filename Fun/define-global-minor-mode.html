<strong>define-global-minor-mode</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/define-globalized-minor-mode.html">define-globalized-minor-mode</a></strong>' in `<code>easy-mmode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(define-global-minor-mode <u>GLOBAL-MODE</u> <u>MODE</u> <u>TURN-ON</u> &rest <u>KEYS</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a global mode <u>GLOBAL-MODE</u> corresponding to buffer-local minor <u>MODE</u>.</br>
<u>TURN-ON</u> is a function that will be called with no args in every buffer</br>
  and that should try to turn <u>MODE</u> on if applicable for that buffer.</br>
<u>KEYS</u> is a list of CL-style keyword arguments.  As the minor mode</br>
  defined by this function is always global, any :global keyword is</br>
  ignored.  Other keywords have the same meaning as in `define-minor-mode',</br>
  which see.  In particular, :group specifies the custom group.</br>
  The most useful keywords are those that are passed on to the</br>
  `defcustom'.  It normally makes no sense to pass the :lighter</br>
  or :keymap keywords to `define-globalized-minor-mode', since these</br>
  are usually passed to the buffer-local version of the minor mode.</br>
</br>
If <u>MODE</u>'s set-up depends on the major mode in effect when it was</br>
enabled, then disabling and reenabling <u>MODE</u> should make <u>MODE</u> work</br>
correctly with the current major mode.  This is important to</br>
prevent problems with derived modes, that is, major modes that</br>
call another major mode in their body.</br>
</br>
When a major mode is initialized, <u>MODE</u> is actually turned on just</br>
after running the major mode's hook.  However, <u>MODE</u> is not turned</br>
on if the hook has explicitly disabled it.
