define-ibuffer-op is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `ibuf-macs.el'.<br/><br/>(define-ibuffer-op OP ARGS DOCUMENTATION (&key INTERACTIVE MARK MODIFIER-P DANGEROUS OPSTRING ACTIVE-OPSTRING COMPLEX) &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Generate a function which operates on a buffer.<br/>OP becomes the name of the function; if it doesn't begin with<br/>`ibuffer-do-', then that is prepended to it.<br/>When an operation is performed, this function will be called once for<br/>each marked buffer, with that buffer current.<br/><br/>ARGS becomes the formal parameters of the function.<br/>DOCUMENTATION becomes the docstring of the function.<br/>INTERACTIVE becomes the interactive specification of the function.<br/>MARK describes which type of mark (:deletion, or nil) this operation<br/>uses.  :deletion means the function operates on buffers marked for<br/>deletion, otherwise it acts on normally marked buffers.<br/>MODIFIER-P describes how the function modifies buffers.  This is used<br/>to set the modification flag of the Ibuffer buffer itself.  Valid<br/>values are:<br/> nil - the function never modifiers buffers<br/> t - the function it always modifies buffers<br/> :maybe - attempt to discover this information by comparing the<br/>  buffer's modification flag.<br/>DANGEROUS is a boolean which should be set if the user should be<br/>prompted before performing this operation.<br/>OPSTRING is a string which will be displayed to the user after the<br/>operation is complete, in the form:<br/> "Operation complete; OPSTRING x buffers"<br/>ACTIVE-OPSTRING is a string which will be displayed to the user in a<br/>confirmation message, in the form:<br/> "Really ACTIVE-OPSTRING x buffers?"<br/>COMPLEX means this function is special; see the source code of this<br/>macro for exactly what it does.
