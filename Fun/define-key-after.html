<strong>define-key-after</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-key-after KEYMAP KEY DEFINITION &optional AFTER)<br/>
<br/>
Add binding in KEYMAP for KEY => DEFINITION, right after AFTER's binding.<br/>
This is like `define-key' except that the binding for KEY is placed<br/>
just after the binding for the event AFTER, instead of at the beginning<br/>
of the map.  Note that AFTER must be an event type (like KEY), NOT a command<br/>
(like DEFINITION).<br/>
<br/>
If AFTER is t or omitted, the new binding goes at the end of the keymap.<br/>
AFTER should be a single event type--a symbol or a character, not a sequence.<br/>
<br/>
Bindings are always added before any inherited map.<br/>
<br/>
The order of bindings in a keymap only matters when it is used as<br/>
a menu, so this function is not useful for non-menu keymaps.
