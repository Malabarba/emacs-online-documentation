<strong>define-key</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-key KEYMAP KEY DEF)<br/>
<br/>
In KEYMAP, define key sequence KEY as DEF.<br/>
KEYMAP is a keymap.<br/>
<br/>
KEY is a string or a vector of symbols and characters, representing a<br/>
sequence of keystrokes and events.  Non-ASCII characters with codes<br/>
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be represented by vectors.<br/>
Two types of vector have special meanings:<br/>
 [remap COMMAND] remaps any key binding for COMMAND.<br/>
 [t] creates a default definition, which applies to any event with no<br/>
    other definition in KEYMAP.<br/>
<br/>
DEF is anything that can be a key's definition:<br/>
 nil (means key is undefined in this keymap),<br/>
 a command (a Lisp function suitable for interactive calling),<br/>
 a string (treated as a keyboard macro),<br/>
 a keymap (to define a prefix key),<br/>
 a symbol (when the key is looked up, the symbol will stand for its<br/>
    function definition, which should at that time be one of the above,<br/>
    or another symbol whose function definition is used, etc.),<br/>
 a cons (STRING . DEFN), meaning that DEFN is the definition<br/>
    (DEFN should be a valid definition in its own right),<br/>
 or a cons (MAP . CHAR), meaning use definition of CHAR in keymap MAP,<br/>
 or an extended menu item definition.<br/>
 (See info node `(elisp)Extended Menu Items'.)<br/>
<br/>
If KEYMAP is a sparse keymap with a binding for KEY, the existing<br/>
binding is altered.  If there is no binding for KEY, the new pair<br/>
binding KEY to DEF is added at the front of KEYMAP.
