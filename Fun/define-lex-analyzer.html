<strong>define-lex-analyzer</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>lex.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-lex-analyzer NAME DOC CONDITION &rest FORMS)<br/>
<br/>
Create a single lexical analyzer NAME with DOC.<br/>
When an analyzer is called, the current buffer and point are<br/>
positioned in a buffer at the location to be analyzed.<br/>
CONDITION is an expression which returns t if FORMS should be run.<br/>
Within the bounds of CONDITION and FORMS, the use of backquote<br/>
can be used to evaluate expressions at compile time.<br/>
While forms are running, the following variables will be locally bound:<br/>
  `semantic-lex-analysis-bounds' - The bounds of the current analysis.<br/>
                  of the form (START . END)<br/>
  `semantic-lex-maximum-depth' - The maximum depth of semantic-list<br/>
                  for the current analysis.<br/>
  `semantic-lex-current-depth' - The current depth of `semantic-list' that has<br/>
                  been descended.<br/>
  `semantic-lex-end-point' - End Point after match.<br/>
                   Analyzers should set this to a buffer location if their<br/>
                   match string does not represent the end of the matched text.<br/>
  `semantic-lex-token-stream' - The token list being collected.<br/>
                   Add new lexical tokens to this list.<br/>
Proper action in FORMS is to move the value of `semantic-lex-end-point' to<br/>
after the location of the analyzed entry, and to add any discovered tokens<br/>
at the beginning of `semantic-lex-token-stream'.<br/>
This can be done by using `semantic-lex-push-token'.
