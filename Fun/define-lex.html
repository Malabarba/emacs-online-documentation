define-lex is a Lisp macro in `lex.el'.<br/><br/>(define-lex NAME DOC &rest ANALYZERS)<br/><br/>Create a new lexical analyzer with NAME.<br/>DOC is a documentation string describing this analyzer.<br/>ANALYZERS are small code snippets of analyzers to use when<br/>building the new NAMED analyzer.  Only use analyzers which<br/>are written to be used in `define-lex'.<br/>Each analyzer should be an analyzer created with `define-lex-analyzer'.<br/>Note: The order in which analyzers are listed is important.<br/>If two analyzers can match the same text, it is important to order the<br/>analyzers so that the one you want to match first occurs first.  For<br/>example, it is good to put a number analyzer in front of a symbol<br/>analyzer which might mistake a number for as a symbol.
