<strong>define-lex</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>lex.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(define-lex <u>NAME</u> <u>DOC</u> &rest <u>ANALYZERS</u>)</br>
</br>
Create a new lexical analyzer with <u>NAME</u>.</br>
<u>DOC</u> is a documentation string describing this analyzer.</br>
<u>ANALYZERS</u> are small code snippets of analyzers to use when</br>
building the new NAMED analyzer.  Only use analyzers which</br>
are written to be used in `define-lex'.</br>
Each analyzer should be an analyzer created with `define-lex-analyzer'.</br>
Note: The order in which analyzers are listed is important.</br>
If two analyzers can match the same text, it is important to order the</br>
analyzers so that the one you want to match first occurs first.  For</br>
example, it is good to put a number analyzer in front of a symbol</br>
analyzer which might mistake a number for as a symbol.
