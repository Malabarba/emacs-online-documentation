<strong>define-mail-alias</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mailalias.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-mail-alias NAME DEFINITION &optional FROM-MAILRC-FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Define NAME as a mail alias that translates to DEFINITION.<br/>
This means that sending a message to NAME will actually send to DEFINITION.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, the addresses in DEFINITION must be separated by commas.<br/>
If FROM-MAILRC-FILE is non-nil, then addresses in DEFINITION<br/>
can be separated by spaces; an address can contain spaces<br/>
if it is quoted with double-quotes.
