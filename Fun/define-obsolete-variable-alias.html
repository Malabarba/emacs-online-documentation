<strong>define-obsolete-variable-alias</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>byte-run.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-obsolete-variable-alias OBSOLETE-NAME CURRENT-NAME WHEN &optional DOCSTRING)<br/>
<br/>
Make OBSOLETE-NAME a variable alias for CURRENT-NAME and mark it obsolete.<br/>
This uses `defvaralias' and `make-obsolete-variable' (which see).<br/>
See the Info node `(elisp)Variable Aliases' for more details.<br/>
<br/>
If CURRENT-NAME is a defcustom (more generally, any variable<br/>
where OBSOLETE-NAME may be set, e.g. in an init file, before the<br/>
alias is defined), then the define-obsolete-variable-alias<br/>
statement should be evaluated before the defcustom, if user<br/>
customizations are to be respected.  The simplest way to achieve<br/>
this is to place the alias statement before the defcustom (this<br/>
is not necessary for aliases that are autoloaded, or in files<br/>
dumped with Emacs).  This is so that any user customizations are<br/>
applied before the defcustom tries to initialize the<br/>
variable (this is due to the way `defvaralias' works).<br/>
<br/>
For the benefit of `custom-set-variables', if OBSOLETE-NAME has<br/>
any of the following properties, they are copied to<br/>
CURRENT-NAME, if it does not already have them:<br/>
'saved-value, 'saved-variable-comment.
