<strong>define-overload</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/define-overloadable-function.html">define-overloadable-function</a></strong>' in `<code>mode-local.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(define-overload <u>NAME</u> <u>ARGS</u> <u>DOCSTRING</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Define a new function, as with `defun', which can be overloaded.</br>
<u>NAME</u> is the name of the function to create.</br>
<u>ARGS</u> are the arguments to the function.</br>
<u>DOCSTRING</u> is a documentation string to describe the function.  The</br>
docstring will automatically have details about its overload symbol</br>
appended to the end.</br>
<u>BODY</u> is code that would be run when there is no override defined.  The</br>
default is to call the function `<u>NAME</u>-default' with the appropriate</br>
arguments.</br>
</br>
<u>BODY</u> can also include an override form that specifies which part of</br>
<u>BODY</u> is specifically overridden.  This permits to specify common code</br>
run for both default and overridden implementations.</br>
An override form is one of:</br>
</br>
  1. (:override [OVERBODY])</br>
  2. (:override-with-args OVERARGS [OVERBODY])</br>
</br>
OVERBODY is the code that would be run when there is no override</br>
defined.  The default is to call the function `<u>NAME</u>-default' with the</br>
appropriate arguments deduced from <u>ARGS</u>.</br>
OVERARGS is a list of arguments passed to the override and</br>
`<u>NAME</u>-default' function, in place of those deduced from <u>ARGS</u>.
