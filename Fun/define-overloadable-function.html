<strong>define-overloadable-function</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>mode-local.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(define-overloadable-function NAME ARGS DOCSTRING &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Define a new function, as with `defun', which can be overloaded.<br/>
NAME is the name of the function to create.<br/>
ARGS are the arguments to the function.<br/>
DOCSTRING is a documentation string to describe the function.  The<br/>
docstring will automatically have details about its overload symbol<br/>
appended to the end.<br/>
BODY is code that would be run when there is no override defined.  The<br/>
default is to call the function `NAME-default' with the appropriate<br/>
arguments.<br/>
<br/>
BODY can also include an override form that specifies which part of<br/>
BODY is specifically overridden.  This permits to specify common code<br/>
run for both default and overridden implementations.<br/>
An override form is one of:<br/>
<br/>
  1. (:override [OVERBODY])<br/>
  2. (:override-with-args OVERARGS [OVERBODY])<br/>
<br/>
OVERBODY is the code that would be run when there is no override<br/>
defined.  The default is to call the function `NAME-default' with the<br/>
appropriate arguments deduced from ARGS.<br/>
OVERARGS is a list of arguments passed to the override and<br/>
`NAME-default' function, in place of those deduced from ARGS.
