define-setf-method is an alias for `define-setf-expander' in `cl.el'.<br/><br/>(define-setf-method NAME ARGLIST &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Define a `setf' method.<br/>This method shows how to handle `setf's to places of the form<br/>(NAME ARGS...).  The argument forms ARGS are bound according to<br/>ARGLIST, as if NAME were going to be expanded as a macro, then<br/>the BODY forms are executed and must return a list of five elements:<br/>a temporary-variables list, a value-forms list, a store-variables list<br/>(of length one), a store-form, and an access- form.<br/><br/>See `gv-define-expander', and `gv-define-setter' for better and<br/>simpler ways to define setf-methods.
