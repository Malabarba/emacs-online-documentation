<strong>defun*</strong> is an alias for `cl-defun' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(defun* NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...)<br/>
<br/>
Define NAME as a function.<br/>
Like normal `defun', except ARGLIST allows full Common Lisp conventions,<br/>
and BODY is implicitly surrounded by (cl-block NAME ...).
