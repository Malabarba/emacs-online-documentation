defun-cvs-mode is a Lisp macro in `pcvs.el'.<br/><br/>(defun-cvs-mode FUN ARGS DOCSTRING INTERACT &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Define a function to be used in a *cvs* buffer.<br/>This will look for a *cvs* buffer and execute BODY in it.<br/>Since the interactive arguments might need to be queried after<br/>switching to the *cvs* buffer, the generic code is rather ugly,<br/>but luckily we can often use simpler alternatives.<br/><br/>FUN can be either a symbol (i.e. STYLE is nil) or a cons (FUN . STYLE).<br/>ARGS and DOCSTRING are the normal argument list.<br/>INTERACT is the interactive specification or nil for non-commands.<br/><br/>STYLE can be either SIMPLE, NOARGS or DOUBLE.  It's an error for it<br/>to have any other value, unless other details of the function make it<br/>clear what alternative to use.<br/>- SIMPLE will get all the interactive arguments from the original buffer.<br/>- NOARGS will get all the arguments from the *cvs* buffer and will<br/>  always behave as if called interactively.<br/>- DOUBLE is the generic case.
