defvar is a special form in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(defvar SYMBOL &optional INITVALUE DOCSTRING)<br/><br/>Define SYMBOL as a variable, and return SYMBOL.<br/>You are not required to define a variable in order to use it, but<br/>defining it lets you supply an initial value and documentation, which<br/>can be referred to by the Emacs help facilities and other programming<br/>tools.  The `defvar' form also declares the variable as "special",<br/>so that it is always dynamically bound even if `lexical-binding' is t.<br/><br/>The optional argument INITVALUE is evaluated, and used to set SYMBOL,<br/>only if SYMBOL's value is void.  If SYMBOL is buffer-local, its<br/>default value is what is set; buffer-local values are not affected.<br/>If INITVALUE is missing, SYMBOL's value is not set.<br/><br/>If SYMBOL has a local binding, then this form affects the local<br/>binding.  This is usually not what you want.  Thus, if you need to<br/>load a file defining variables, with this form or with `defconst' or<br/>`defcustom', you should always load that file _outside_ any bindings<br/>for these variables.  (`defconst' and `defcustom' behave similarly in<br/>this respect.)<br/><br/>The optional argument DOCSTRING is a documentation string for the<br/>variable.<br/><br/>To define a user option, use `defcustom' instead of `defvar'.
