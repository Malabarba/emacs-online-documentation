<strong>delete-backward-char</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-backward-char N &optional KILLFLAG)<br/>
<br/>
Delete the previous N characters (following if N is negative).<br/>
If Transient Mark mode is enabled, the mark is active, and N is 1,<br/>
delete the text in the region and deactivate the mark instead.<br/>
To disable this, set `delete-active-region' to nil.<br/>
<br/>
Optional second arg KILLFLAG, if non-nil, means to kill (save in<br/>
kill ring) instead of delete.  Interactively, N is the prefix<br/>
arg, and KILLFLAG is set if N is explicitly specified.<br/>
<br/>
In Overwrite mode, single character backward deletion may replace<br/>
tabs with spaces so as to back over columns, unless point is at<br/>
the end of the line.
