<strong>delete-directory</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-directory DIRECTORY &optional RECURSIVE TRASH)<br/>
<br/>
Delete the directory named DIRECTORY.  Does not follow symlinks.<br/>
If RECURSIVE is non-nil, all files in DIRECTORY are deleted as well.<br/>
TRASH non-nil means to trash the directory instead, provided<br/>
`delete-by-moving-to-trash' is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
When called interactively, TRASH is t if no prefix argument is<br/>
given.  With a prefix argument, TRASH is nil.
