<strong>delete-forward-char</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <deletechar>.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-forward-char N &optional KILLFLAG)<br/>
<br/>
Delete the following N characters (previous if N is negative).<br/>
If Transient Mark mode is enabled, the mark is active, and N is 1,<br/>
delete the text in the region and deactivate the mark instead.<br/>
To disable this, set `delete-active-region' to nil.<br/>
<br/>
Optional second arg KILLFLAG non-nil means to kill (save in kill<br/>
ring) instead of delete.  Interactively, N is the prefix arg, and<br/>
KILLFLAG is set if N was explicitly specified.
