<strong>delete-matching-lines</strong> is an alias for `flush-lines' in `<code>replace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-matching-lines REGEXP &optional RSTART REND INTERACTIVE)<br/>
<br/>
Delete lines containing matches for REGEXP.<br/>
When called from Lisp (and usually when called interactively as<br/>
well, see below), applies to the part of the buffer after point.<br/>
The line point is in is deleted if and only if it contains a<br/>
match for regexp starting after point.<br/>
<br/>
If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')<br/>
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.<br/>
Lines partially contained in this region are deleted if and only if<br/>
they contain a match entirely contained in it.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate<br/>
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the<br/>
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.  When calling this function<br/>
from Lisp, you can pretend that it was called interactively by passing<br/>
a non-nil INTERACTIVE argument.<br/>
<br/>
If a match is split across lines, all the lines it lies in are deleted.<br/>
They are deleted _before_ looking for the next match.  Hence, a match<br/>
starting on the same line at which another match ended is ignored.
