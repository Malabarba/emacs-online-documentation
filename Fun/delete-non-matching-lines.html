delete-non-matching-lines is an alias for `keep-lines' in `replace.el'.<br/><br/>(delete-non-matching-lines REGEXP &optional RSTART REND INTERACTIVE)<br/><br/>Delete all lines except those containing matches for REGEXP.<br/>A match split across lines preserves all the lines it lies in.<br/>When called from Lisp (and usually interactively as well, see below)<br/>applies to all lines starting after point.<br/><br/>If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')<br/>and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.<br/><br/>Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.<br/>This command operates on (the accessible part of) all lines whose<br/>accessible part is entirely contained in the region determined by RSTART<br/>and REND.  (A newline ending a line counts as part of that line.)<br/><br/>Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate<br/>on all lines whose accessible part is entirely contained in the region.<br/>Otherwise, the command applies to all lines starting after point.<br/>When calling this function from Lisp, you can pretend that it was<br/>called interactively by passing a non-nil INTERACTIVE argument.<br/><br/>This function starts looking for the next match from the end of<br/>the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap<br/>a previously found match.
