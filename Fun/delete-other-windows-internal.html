delete-other-windows-internal is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(delete-other-windows-internal &optional WINDOW ROOT)<br/><br/>Make WINDOW fill its frame.<br/>Only the frame WINDOW is on is affected.  WINDOW must be a valid window<br/>and defaults to the selected one.<br/><br/>Optional argument ROOT, if non-nil, must specify an internal window such<br/>that WINDOW is in its window subtree.  If this is the case, replace ROOT<br/>by WINDOW and leave alone any windows not part of ROOT's subtree.<br/><br/>When WINDOW is live try to reduce display jumps by keeping the text<br/>previously visible in WINDOW in the same place on the frame.  Doing this<br/>depends on the value of (window-start WINDOW), so if calling this<br/>function in a program gives strange scrolling, make sure the<br/>window-start value is reasonable when this function is called.
