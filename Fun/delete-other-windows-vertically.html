<strong>delete-other-windows-vertically</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(delete-other-windows-vertically &optional <u>WINDOW</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete the windows in the same column with <u>WINDOW</u>, but not <u>WINDOW</u> itself.</br>
This may be a useful alternative binding for C-x 1</br>
 if you often split windows horizontally.
