<strong>delete-other-windows</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x 1, <menu-bar> <file> <one-window>.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-other-windows &optional WINDOW)<br/>
<br/>
Make WINDOW fill its frame.<br/>
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
Return nil.<br/>
<br/>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the<br/>
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not<br/>
process any parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the<br/>
`delete-other-windows' parameter of WINDOW specifies a function,<br/>
call that function with WINDOW as its sole argument and return<br/>
the value returned by that function.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call this<br/>
function with the root of the atomic window as its argument.  If<br/>
WINDOW is a non-side window, make WINDOW the only non-side window<br/>
on the frame.  Side windows are not deleted.  If WINDOW is a side<br/>
window signal an error.
