</br>
(delete-selection-helper <u>TYPE</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete selection according to <u>TYPE</u>:</br>
 `yank'</br>
     For commands which do a yank; ensures the region about to be</br>
     deleted isn't yanked.</br>
 `supersede'</br>
     Delete the active region and ignore the current command,</br>
     i.e. the command will just delete the region.</br>
 `kill'</br>
     `kill-region' is used on the selection, rather than</br>
     `delete-region'.  (Text selected with the mouse will typically</br>
     be yankable anyhow.)</br>
 t</br>
     The normal case: delete the active region prior to executing</br>
     the command which will insert replacement text.</br>
 FUNCTION</br>
     For commands which need to dynamically determine this behavior.</br>
     FUNCTION should take no argument and return one of the above values or nil.
