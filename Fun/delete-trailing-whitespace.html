<strong>delete-trailing-whitespace</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(delete-trailing-whitespace &optional <u>START</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete trailing whitespace between <u>START</u> and <u>END</u>.</br>
If called interactively, <u>START</u> and <u>END</u> are the start/end of the</br>
region if the mark is active, or of the buffer's accessible</br>
portion if the mark is inactive.</br>
</br>
This command deletes whitespace characters after the last</br>
non-whitespace character in each line between <u>START</u> and <u>END</u>.  It</br>
does not consider formfeed characters to be whitespace.</br>
</br>
If this command acts on the entire buffer (i.e. if called</br>
interactively with the mark inactive, or called from Lisp with</br>
<u>END</u> nil), it also deletes all trailing lines at the end of the</br>
buffer if the variable `delete-trailing-lines' is non-nil.
