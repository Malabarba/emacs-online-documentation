<strong>delete-trailing-whitespace</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-trailing-whitespace &optional START END)<br/>
<br/>
Delete trailing whitespace between START and END.<br/>
If called interactively, START and END are the start/end of the<br/>
region if the mark is active, or of the buffer's accessible<br/>
portion if the mark is inactive.<br/>
<br/>
This command deletes whitespace characters after the last<br/>
non-whitespace character in each line between START and END.  It<br/>
does not consider formfeed characters to be whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
If this command acts on the entire buffer (i.e. if called<br/>
interactively with the mark inactive, or called from Lisp with<br/>
END nil), it also deletes all trailing lines at the end of the<br/>
buffer if the variable `delete-trailing-lines' is non-nil.
