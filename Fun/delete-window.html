delete-window is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x 0.<br/><br/>(delete-window &optional WINDOW)<br/><br/>Delete WINDOW.<br/>WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>Return nil.<br/><br/>If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the<br/>`delete-window' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not process any<br/>parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the `delete-window'<br/>parameter of WINDOW specifies a function, call that function with<br/>WINDOW as its sole argument and return the value returned by that<br/>function.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call<br/>`delete-window' with the root of the atomic window as its<br/>argument.  Signal an error if WINDOW is either the only window on<br/>its frame, the last non-side window, or part of an atomic window<br/>that is its frame's root window.
