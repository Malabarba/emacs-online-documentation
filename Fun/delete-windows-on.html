<strong>delete-windows-on</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(delete-windows-on &optional BUFFER-OR-NAME FRAME)<br/>
<br/>
Delete all windows showing BUFFER-OR-NAME.<br/>
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer<br/>
and defaults to the current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
The following non-nil values of the optional argument FRAME<br/>
have special meanings:<br/>
<br/>
- t means consider all windows on the selected frame only.<br/>
<br/>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on<br/>
  the current terminal.<br/>
<br/>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible<br/>
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.<br/>
<br/>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.<br/>
<br/>
Any other value of FRAME means consider all windows on all<br/>
frames.<br/>
<br/>
When a window showing BUFFER-OR-NAME is dedicated and the only<br/>
window of its frame, that frame is deleted when there are other<br/>
frames left.
