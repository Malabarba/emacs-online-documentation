<strong>delete</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(delete <u>ELT</u> <u>SEQ</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete members of <u>SEQ</u> which are `equal' to <u>ELT</u>, and return the result.</br>
<u>SEQ</u> must be a sequence (i.e. a list, a vector, or a string).</br>
The return value is a sequence of the same type.</br>
</br>
If <u>SEQ</u> is a list, this behaves like `delq', except that it compares</br>
with `equal' instead of `eq'.  In particular, it may remove elements</br>
by altering the list structure.</br>
</br>
If <u>SEQ</u> is not a list, deletion is never performed destructively;</br>
instead this function creates and returns a new vector or string.</br>
</br>
Write `(setq foo (delete element foo))' to be sure of correctly</br>
changing the value of a sequence `foo'.
