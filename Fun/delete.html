delete is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(delete ELT SEQ)<br/><br/>Delete members of SEQ which are `equal' to ELT, and return the result.<br/>SEQ must be a sequence (i.e. a list, a vector, or a string).<br/>The return value is a sequence of the same type.<br/><br/>If SEQ is a list, this behaves like `delq', except that it compares<br/>with `equal' instead of `eq'.  In particular, it may remove elements<br/>by altering the list structure.<br/><br/>If SEQ is not a list, deletion is never performed destructively;<br/>instead this function creates and returns a new vector or string.<br/><br/>Write `(setq foo (delete element foo))' to be sure of correctly<br/>changing the value of a sequence `foo'.
