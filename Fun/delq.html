<strong>delq</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(delq <u>ELT</u> <u>LIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete members of <u>LIST</u> which are `eq' to <u>ELT</u>, and return the result.</br>
More precisely, this function skips any members `eq' to <u>ELT</u> at the</br>
front of <u>LIST</u>, then removes members `eq' to <u>ELT</u> from the remaining</br>
sublist by modifying its list structure, then returns the resulting</br>
list.</br>
</br>
Write `(setq foo (delq element foo))' to be sure of correctly changing</br>
the value of a list `foo'.
