<strong>derived-mode-class</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>derived.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(derived-mode-class MODE)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>
use `derived-mode-p' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Find the class of a major MODE.<br/>
A mode's class is the first ancestor which is NOT a derived mode.<br/>
Use the `derived-mode-parent' property of the symbol to trace backwards.<br/>
Since major-modes might all derive from `fundamental-mode', this function<br/>
is not very useful.
