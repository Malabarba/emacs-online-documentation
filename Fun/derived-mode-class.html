derived-mode-class is a compiled Lisp function in `derived.el'.<br/><br/>(derived-mode-class MODE)<br/><br/>This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>use `derived-mode-p' instead.<br/><br/>Find the class of a major MODE.<br/>A mode's class is the first ancestor which is NOT a derived mode.<br/>Use the `derived-mode-parent' property of the symbol to trace backwards.<br/>Since major-modes might all derive from `fundamental-mode', this function<br/>is not very useful.
