<strong>desktop-read</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>desktop.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(desktop-read &optional <u>DIRNAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Read and process the desktop file in directory <u>DIRNAME</u>.</br>
Look for a desktop file in <u>DIRNAME</u>, or if <u>DIRNAME</u> is omitted, look in</br>
directories listed in `desktop-path'.  If a desktop file is found, it</br>
is processed and `desktop-after-read-hook' is run.  If no desktop file</br>
is found, clear the desktop and run `desktop-no-desktop-file-hook'.</br>
This function is a no-op when Emacs is running in batch mode.</br>
It returns t if a desktop file was loaded, nil otherwise.
