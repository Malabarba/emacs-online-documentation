<strong>desktop-read</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>desktop.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(desktop-read &optional DIRNAME)<br/>
<br/>
Read and process the desktop file in directory DIRNAME.<br/>
Look for a desktop file in DIRNAME, or if DIRNAME is omitted, look in<br/>
directories listed in `desktop-path'.  If a desktop file is found, it<br/>
is processed and `desktop-after-read-hook' is run.  If no desktop file<br/>
is found, clear the desktop and run `desktop-no-desktop-file-hook'.<br/>
This function is a no-op when Emacs is running in batch mode.<br/>
It returns t if a desktop file was loaded, nil otherwise.
