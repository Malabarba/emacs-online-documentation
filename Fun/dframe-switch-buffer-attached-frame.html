<strong>dframe-switch-buffer-attached-frame</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>dframe.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dframe-switch-buffer-attached-frame &optional BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Switch to BUFFER in the attached frame, and raise that frame.<br/>
This overrides the default behavior of `switch-to-buffer' which is<br/>
broken because of the dedicated frame.
