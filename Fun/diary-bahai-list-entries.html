<strong>diary-bahai-list-entries</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>cal-bahai.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(diary-bahai-list-entries)</br>
</br>
Add any Bahá'í date entries from the diary file to `diary-entries-list'.</br>
Bahá'í date diary entries must be prefaced by `diary-bahai-entry-symbol'</br>
(normally a `B').  The same diary date forms govern the style of the</br>
Bahá'í calendar entries, except that the Bahá'í month names cannot be</br>
abbreviated.  The Bahá'í months are numbered from 1 to 19 with Bahá being</br>
1 and 19 being `Alá.  If a Bahá'í date diary entry begins with</br>
`diary-nonmarking-symbol', the entry will appear in the diary listing, but</br>
will not be marked in the calendar.  This function is provided for use with</br>
`diary-nongregorian-listing-hook'.
