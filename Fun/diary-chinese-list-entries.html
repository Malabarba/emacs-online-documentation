<strong>diary-chinese-list-entries</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>cal-china.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(diary-chinese-list-entries)</br>
</br>
Add any Chinese date entries from the diary file to `diary-entries-list'.</br>
Chinese date diary entries must be prefixed by `diary-chinese-entry-symbol'</br>
(normally a `C').  The same `diary-date-forms' govern the style</br>
of the Chinese calendar entries.  If a Chinese date diary entry begins with</br>
`diary-nonmarking-symbol', the entry will appear in the diary listing,</br>
but will not be marked in the calendar.</br>
</br>
This function is provided for use with `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook'.
