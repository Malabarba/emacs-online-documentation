<strong>diary-from-outlook-gnus</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(diary-from-outlook-gnus &optional <u>NOCONFIRM</u>)</br>
</br>
Maybe snarf diary entry from Outlook-generated message in Gnus.</br>
Unless the optional argument <u>NOCONFIRM</u> is non-nil (which is the case when</br>
this function is called interactively), then if an entry is found the</br>
user is asked to confirm its addition.</br>
Add this function to `gnus-article-prepare-hook' to notice appointments</br>
automatically.
