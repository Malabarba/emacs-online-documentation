diary-hebrew-list-entries is an autoloaded Lisp function in `cal-hebrew.el'.<br/><br/>(diary-hebrew-list-entries)<br/><br/>Add any Hebrew date entries from the diary file to `diary-entries-list'.<br/>Hebrew date diary entries must be prefaced by `diary-hebrew-entry-symbol'<br/>(normally an `H').  The same diary date forms govern the style<br/>of the Hebrew calendar entries, except that the Hebrew month<br/>names cannot be abbreviated.  The Hebrew months are numbered<br/>from 1 to 13 with Nisan being 1, 12 being Adar I and 13 being<br/>Adar II; you must use `Adar I' if you want Adar of a common<br/>Hebrew year.  If a Hebrew date diary entry begins with<br/>`diary-nonmarking-symbol', the entry will appear in the diary<br/>listing, but will not be marked in the calendar.  This function<br/>is provided for use with `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook'.
