<strong>diary-include-files</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(diary-include-files &optional <u>MARK</u>)</br>
</br>
Process diary entries from included diary files.</br>
By default, lists included entries, but if optional argument <u>MARK</u> is non-nil</br>
marks entries instead.</br>
For example, this enables you to share common diary files.</br>
Specify include files using lines matching `diary-include-string', e.g.</br>
    #include "filename"</br>
This is recursive; that is, included files may include other files.
