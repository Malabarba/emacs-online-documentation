<strong>diary-list-entries</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(diary-list-entries <u>DATE</u> <u>NUMBER</u> &optional <u>LIST-ONLY</u>)</br>
</br>
Create and display a buffer containing the relevant lines in `diary-file'.</br>
Selects entries for <u>NUMBER</u> days starting with date <u>DATE</u>.  Hides any</br>
other entries using overlays.  If <u>NUMBER</u> is less than 1, this function</br>
does nothing.</br>
</br>
Returns a list of all relevant diary entries found.</br>
The list entries have the form ((MONTH DAY YEAR) STRING SPECIFIER) where</br>
(MONTH DAY YEAR) is the date of the entry, STRING is the entry text, and</br>
SPECIFIER is the applicability.  If the variable `diary-list-include-blanks'</br>
is non-nil, this list includes a dummy diary entry consisting of the empty</br>
string for a date with no diary entries.</br>
</br>
If producing entries for multiple dates (i.e., <u>NUMBER</u> > 1), then</br>
this function normally returns the entries from any given diary</br>
file in date order.  The entries for any given day are in the</br>
order in which they were found in the file, not necessarily in</br>
time-of-day order.  Note that any functions present on the</br>
hooks (see below) may add entries, or change the order.  For</br>
example, `diary-include-other-diary-files' adds entries from any</br>
include files that it finds to the end of the original list.  The</br>
entries from each file will be in date order, but the overall</br>
list will not be.  If you want the entire list to be in time</br>
order, add `diary-sort-entries' to the end of `diary-list-entries-hook'.</br>
</br>
After preparing the initial list, hooks run in this order:</br>
</br>
  `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook' runs for the main diary file,</br>
      and each included file.  For example, this is the appropriate hook</br>
      to process Islamic entries in all diary files.</br>
</br>
  `diary-list-entries-hook' runs once only, for the main diary file.</br>
      For example, this is appropriate for sorting all the entries.</br>
      If not using include files, there is no difference from the previous</br>
      hook.</br>
</br>
  `diary-hook' runs last, after the diary is displayed.</br>
      This is used e.g. by `appt-check'.</br>
</br>
Functions called by these hooks may use the variables ORIGINAL-DATE</br>
and <u>NUMBER</u>, which are the arguments with which this function was called.</br>
Note that hook functions should _not_ use <u>DATE</u>, but ORIGINAL-DATE.</br>
(Sexp diary entries may use <u>DATE</u> - see `diary-list-sexp-entries'.)</br>
</br>
This function displays the list using `diary-display-function', unless</br>
<u>LIST-ONLY</u> is non-nil, in which case it just returns the list.
