diary-list-entries is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `diary-lib.el'.<br/><br/>(diary-list-entries DATE NUMBER &optional LIST-ONLY)<br/><br/>Create and display a buffer containing the relevant lines in `diary-file'.<br/>Selects entries for NUMBER days starting with date DATE.  Hides any<br/>other entries using overlays.  If NUMBER is less than 1, this function<br/>does nothing.<br/><br/>Returns a list of all relevant diary entries found.<br/>The list entries have the form ((MONTH DAY YEAR) STRING SPECIFIER) where<br/>(MONTH DAY YEAR) is the date of the entry, STRING is the entry text, and<br/>SPECIFIER is the applicability.  If the variable `diary-list-include-blanks'<br/>is non-nil, this list includes a dummy diary entry consisting of the empty<br/>string for a date with no diary entries.<br/><br/>If producing entries for multiple dates (i.e., NUMBER > 1), then<br/>this function normally returns the entries from any given diary<br/>file in date order.  The entries for any given day are in the<br/>order in which they were found in the file, not necessarily in<br/>time-of-day order.  Note that any functions present on the<br/>hooks (see below) may add entries, or change the order.  For<br/>example, `diary-include-other-diary-files' adds entries from any<br/>include files that it finds to the end of the original list.  The<br/>entries from each file will be in date order, but the overall<br/>list will not be.  If you want the entire list to be in time<br/>order, add `diary-sort-entries' to the end of `diary-list-entries-hook'.<br/><br/>After preparing the initial list, hooks run in this order:<br/><br/>  `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook' runs for the main diary file,<br/>      and each included file.  For example, this is the appropriate hook<br/>      to process Islamic entries in all diary files.<br/><br/>  `diary-list-entries-hook' runs once only, for the main diary file.<br/>      For example, this is appropriate for sorting all the entries.<br/>      If not using include files, there is no difference from the previous<br/>      hook.<br/><br/>  `diary-hook' runs last, after the diary is displayed.<br/>      This is used e.g. by `appt-check'.<br/><br/>Functions called by these hooks may use the variables ORIGINAL-DATE<br/>and NUMBER, which are the arguments with which this function was called.<br/>Note that hook functions should _not_ use DATE, but ORIGINAL-DATE.<br/>(Sexp diary entries may use DATE - see `diary-list-sexp-entries'.)<br/><br/>This function displays the list using `diary-display-function', unless<br/>LIST-ONLY is non-nil, in which case it just returns the list.
