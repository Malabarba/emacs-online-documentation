<strong>diary-make-date</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(diary-make-date A B C)<br/>
<br/>
Convert A B C into the internal calendar date form.<br/>
The expected order of the inputs depends on `calendar-date-style',<br/>
e.g. in the European case, A = day, B = month, C = year.  Returns<br/>
a list (MONTH DAY YEAR), i.e. the American style, which is the<br/>
form used internally by the calendar and diary.
