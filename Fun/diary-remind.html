<strong>diary-remind</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(diary-remind SEXP DAYS &optional MARKING)<br/>
<br/>
Provide a reminder of a diary entry.<br/>
SEXP is a diary-sexp.  DAYS is either a single number or a list<br/>
of numbers indicating the number(s) of days before the event that<br/>
the warning(s) should occur on.  A negative number -DAYS has the<br/>
same meaning as a list (1 2 ... DAYS).  If the current date<br/>
is (one of) DAYS before the event indicated by SEXP, then this function<br/>
returns a suitable message (as specified by `diary-remind-message').<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the reminders beforehand, the diary entry also<br/>
appears on the date itself.<br/>
<br/>
A `diary-nonmarking-symbol' at the beginning of the line of the<br/>
`diary-remind' entry specifies that the diary entry (not the<br/>
reminder) is non-marking.  Marking of reminders is independent of<br/>
whether the entry itself is a marking or nonmarking; if optional<br/>
parameter MARKING is non-nil then the reminders are marked on the<br/>
calendar.
