<strong>diary</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(diary &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Generate the diary window for <u>ARG</u> days starting with the current date.</br>
If no argument is provided, the number of days of diary entries is governed</br>
by the variable `diary-number-of-entries'.  A value of <u>ARG</u> less than 1</br>
does nothing.  This function is suitable for execution in an init file.
