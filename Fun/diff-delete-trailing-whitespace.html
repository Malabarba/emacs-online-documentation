<strong>diff-delete-trailing-whitespace</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>diff-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(diff-delete-trailing-whitespace &optional <u>OTHER-FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Remove trailing whitespace from lines modified in this diff.</br>
This edits both the current Diff mode buffer and the patched</br>
source file(s).  If `diff-jump-to-old-file' is non-nil, edit the</br>
original (unpatched) source file instead.  With a prefix argument</br>
<u>OTHER-FILE</u>, flip the choice of which source file to edit.</br>
</br>
If a file referenced in the diff has no buffer and needs to be</br>
fixed, visit it in a buffer.
