diff-merge-strings is a compiled Lisp function in `diff-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(diff-merge-strings ANCESTOR FROM TO)<br/><br/>Merge the diff between ANCESTOR and FROM into TO.<br/>Returns the merged string if successful or nil otherwise.<br/>The strings are assumed not to contain any "\n" (i.e. end of line).<br/>If ANCESTOR = FROM, returns TO.<br/>If ANCESTOR = TO, returns FROM.<br/>The heuristic is simplistic and only really works for cases<br/>like (diff-merge-strings "b/foo" "b/bar" "/a/c/foo").
