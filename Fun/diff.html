<strong>diff</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>diff.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(diff <u>OLD</u> <u>NEW</u> &optional <u>SWITCHES</u> <u>NO-ASYNC</u>)</br>
</br>
Find and display the differences between <u>OLD</u> and <u>NEW</u> files.</br>
When called interactively, read <u>NEW</u>, then <u>OLD</u>, using the</br>
minibuffer.  The default for <u>NEW</u> is the current buffer's file</br>
name, and the default for <u>OLD</u> is a backup file for <u>NEW</u>, if one</br>
exists.  If <u>NO-ASYNC</u> is non-nil, call diff synchronously.</br>
</br>
When called interactively with a prefix argument, prompt</br>
interactively for diff switches.  Otherwise, the switches</br>
specified in the variable `diff-switches' are passed to the diff command.
