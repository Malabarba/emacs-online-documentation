diff is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `diff.el'.<br/><br/>(diff OLD NEW &optional SWITCHES NO-ASYNC)<br/><br/>Find and display the differences between OLD and NEW files.<br/>When called interactively, read NEW, then OLD, using the<br/>minibuffer.  The default for NEW is the current buffer's file<br/>name, and the default for OLD is a backup file for NEW, if one<br/>exists.  If NO-ASYNC is non-nil, call diff synchronously.<br/><br/>When called interactively with a prefix argument, prompt<br/>interactively for diff switches.  Otherwise, the switches<br/>specified in `diff-switches' are passed to the diff command.
