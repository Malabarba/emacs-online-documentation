<strong>dir-locals-find-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(dir-locals-find-file <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Find the directory-local variables for <u>FILE</u>.</br>
This searches upward in the directory tree from <u>FILE</u>.</br>
It stops at the first directory that has been registered in</br>
`dir-locals-directory-cache' or contains a `dir-locals-file'.</br>
If it finds an entry in the cache, it checks that it is valid.</br>
A cache entry with no modification time element (normally, one that</br>
has been assigned directly using `dir-locals-set-directory-class', not</br>
set from a file) is always valid.</br>
A cache entry based on a `dir-locals-file' is valid if the modification</br>
time stored in the cache matches the current file modification time.</br>
If not, the cache entry is cleared so that the file will be re-read.</br>
</br>
This function returns either nil (no directory local variables found),</br>
or the matching entry from `dir-locals-directory-cache' (a list),</br>
or the full path to the `dir-locals-file' (a string) in the case</br>
of no valid cache entry.
