</br>
(dir-locals-set-class-variables <u>CLASS</u> <u>VARIABLES</u>)</br>
</br>
Map the type <u>CLASS</u> to a list of variable settings.</br>
<u>CLASS</u> is the project class, a symbol.  <u>VARIABLES</u> is a list</br>
that declares directory-local variables for the class.</br>
An element in <u>VARIABLES</u> is either of the form:</br>
    (MAJOR-MODE . ALIST)</br>
or</br>
    (DIRECTORY . LIST)</br>
</br>
In the first form, MAJOR-MODE is a symbol, and ALIST is an alist</br>
whose elements are of the form (VARIABLE . VALUE).</br>
</br>
In the second form, DIRECTORY is a directory name (a string), and</br>
LIST is a list of the form accepted by the function.</br>
</br>
When a file is visited, the file's class is found.  A directory</br>
may be assigned a class using `dir-locals-set-directory-class'.</br>
Then variables are set in the file's buffer according to the</br>
<u>VARIABLES</u> list of the class.  The list is processed in order.</br>
</br>
* If the element is of the form (MAJOR-MODE . ALIST), and the</br>
  buffer's major mode is derived from MAJOR-MODE (as determined</br>
  by `derived-mode-p'), then all the variables in ALIST are</br>
  applied.  A MAJOR-MODE of nil may be used to match any buffer.</br>
  `make-local-variable' is called for each variable before it is</br>
  set.</br>
</br>
* If the element is of the form (DIRECTORY . LIST), and DIRECTORY</br>
  is an initial substring of the file's directory, then LIST is</br>
  applied by recursively following these rules.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
