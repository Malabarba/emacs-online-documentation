<strong>dir-locals-set-class-variables</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dir-locals-set-class-variables CLASS VARIABLES)<br/>
<br/>
Map the type CLASS to a list of variable settings.<br/>
CLASS is the project class, a symbol.  VARIABLES is a list<br/>
that declares directory-local variables for the class.<br/>
An element in VARIABLES is either of the form:<br/>
    (MAJOR-MODE . ALIST)<br/>
or<br/>
    (DIRECTORY . LIST)<br/>
<br/>
In the first form, MAJOR-MODE is a symbol, and ALIST is an alist<br/>
whose elements are of the form (VARIABLE . VALUE).<br/>
<br/>
In the second form, DIRECTORY is a directory name (a string), and<br/>
LIST is a list of the form accepted by the function.<br/>
<br/>
When a file is visited, the file's class is found.  A directory<br/>
may be assigned a class using `dir-locals-set-directory-class'.<br/>
Then variables are set in the file's buffer according to the<br/>
VARIABLES list of the class.  The list is processed in order.<br/>
<br/>
* If the element is of the form (MAJOR-MODE . ALIST), and the<br/>
  buffer's major mode is derived from MAJOR-MODE (as determined<br/>
  by `derived-mode-p'), then all the variables in ALIST are<br/>
  applied.  A MAJOR-MODE of nil may be used to match any buffer.<br/>
  `make-local-variable' is called for each variable before it is<br/>
  set.<br/>
<br/>
* If the element is of the form (DIRECTORY . LIST), and DIRECTORY<br/>
  is an initial substring of the file's directory, then LIST is<br/>
  applied by recursively following these rules.
