<strong>directory-files-and-attributes</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(directory-files-and-attributes DIRECTORY &optional FULL MATCH NOSORT ID-FORMAT)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of names of files and their attributes in DIRECTORY.<br/>
There are four optional arguments:<br/>
If FULL is non-nil, return absolute file names.  Otherwise return names<br/>
 that are relative to the specified directory.<br/>
If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.<br/>
If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.<br/>
 NOSORT is useful if you plan to sort the result yourself.<br/>
ID-FORMAT specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid, see<br/>
`file-attributes' for further documentation.<br/>
On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',<br/>
which see.
