dired-diff is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `dired-aux.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-diff FILE &optional SWITCHES)<br/><br/>Compare file at point with file FILE using `diff'.<br/>If called interactively, prompt for FILE.  If the file at point<br/>has a backup file, use that as the default.  If the mark is active<br/>in Transient Mark mode, use the file at the mark as the default.<br/>(That's the mark set by C-SPC, not by Dired's<br/>M-x dired-mark command.)<br/><br/>FILE is the first file given to `diff'.  The file at point<br/>is the second file given to `diff'.<br/><br/>With prefix arg, prompt for second argument SWITCHES, which is<br/>the string of command switches for the third argument of `diff'.
