</br>
</br>
(dired-diff <u>FILE</u> &optional <u>SWITCHES</u>)</br>
</br>
Compare file at point with file <u>FILE</u> using `diff'.</br>
If called interactively, prompt for <u>FILE</u>.  If the file at point</br>
has a backup file, use that as the default.  If the file at point</br>
is a backup file, use its original.  If the mark is active</br>
in Transient Mark mode, use the file at the mark as the default.</br>
(That's the mark set by C-SPC, not by Dired's</br>
M-x dired-mark command.)</br>
</br>
<u>FILE</u> is the first file given to `diff'.  The file at point</br>
is the second file given to `diff'.</br>
</br>
With prefix arg, prompt for second argument <u>SWITCHES</u>, which is</br>
the string of command switches for the third argument of `diff'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
