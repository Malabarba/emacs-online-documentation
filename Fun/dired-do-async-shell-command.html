<strong>dired-do-async-shell-command</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(dired-do-async-shell-command <u>COMMAND</u> &optional <u>ARG</u> <u>FILE-LIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Run a shell command <u>COMMAND</u> on the marked files asynchronously.</br>
</br>
Like `dired-do-shell-command', but adds `&' at the end of <u>COMMAND</u></br>
to execute it asynchronously.</br>
</br>
When operating on multiple files, asynchronous commands</br>
are executed in the background on each file in parallel.</br>
In shell syntax this means separating the individual commands</br>
with `&'.  However, when <u>COMMAND</u> ends in `;' or `;&' then commands</br>
are executed in the background on each file sequentially waiting</br>
for each command to terminate before running the next command.</br>
In shell syntax this means separating the individual commands with `;'.</br>
</br>
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.
