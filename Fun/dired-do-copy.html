<strong>dired-do-copy</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(dired-do-copy &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Copy all marked (or next <u>ARG</u>) files, or copy the current file.</br>
When operating on just the current file, prompt for the new name.</br>
</br>
When operating on multiple or marked files, prompt for a target</br>
directory, and make the new copies in that directory, with the</br>
same names as the original files.  The initial suggestion for the</br>
target directory is the Dired buffer's current directory (or, if</br>
`dired-dwim-target' is non-nil, the current directory of a</br>
neighboring Dired window).</br>
</br>
If `dired-copy-preserve-time' is non-nil, this command preserves</br>
the modification time of each old file in the copy, similar to</br>
the "-p" option for the "cp" shell command.</br>
</br>
This command copies symbolic links by creating new ones, similar</br>
to the "-d" option for the "cp" shell command.
