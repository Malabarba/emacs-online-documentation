dired-do-create-files is a compiled Lisp function in `dired-aux.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-do-create-files OP-SYMBOL FILE-CREATOR OPERATION ARG &optional MARKER-CHAR OP1 HOW-TO)<br/><br/>Create a new file for each marked file.<br/>Prompt user for a target directory in which to create the new<br/>  files.  The target may also be a non-directory file, if only<br/>  one file is marked.  The initial suggestion for target is the<br/>  Dired buffer's current directory (or, if `dired-dwim-target' is<br/>  non-nil, the current directory of a neighboring Dired window).<br/>OP-SYMBOL is the symbol for the operation.  Function `dired-mark-pop-up'<br/>  will determine whether pop-ups are appropriate for this OP-SYMBOL.<br/>FILE-CREATOR and OPERATION as in `dired-create-files'.<br/>ARG as in `dired-get-marked-files'.<br/>Optional arg MARKER-CHAR as in `dired-create-files'.<br/>Optional arg OP1 is an alternate form for OPERATION if there is<br/>  only one file.<br/>Optional arg HOW-TO determines how to treat the target.<br/>  If HOW-TO is nil, use `file-directory-p' to determine if the<br/>   target is a directory.  If so, the marked file(s) are created<br/>   inside that directory.  Otherwise, the target is a plain file;<br/>   an error is raised unless there is exactly one marked file.<br/>  If HOW-TO is t, target is always treated as a plain file.<br/>  Otherwise, HOW-TO should be a function of one argument, TARGET.<br/>   If its return value is nil, TARGET is regarded as a plain file.<br/>   If it return value is a list, TARGET is a generalized<br/>    directory (e.g. some sort of archive).  The first element of<br/>    this list must be a function with at least four arguments:<br/>      operation - as OPERATION above.<br/>      rfn-list  - list of the relative names for the marked files.<br/>      fn-list   - list of the absolute names for the marked files.<br/>      target    - the name of the target itself.<br/>      The rest of into-dir are optional arguments.<br/>   For any other return value, TARGET is treated as a directory.
