<br/>
(dired-do-hardlink &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Add names (hard links) current file or all marked (or next ARG) files.<br/>
When operating on just the current file, you specify the new name.<br/>
When operating on multiple or marked files, you specify a directory<br/>
and new hard links are made in that directory<br/>
with the same names that the files currently have.  The default<br/>
suggested for the target directory depends on the value of<br/>
`dired-dwim-target', which see.
