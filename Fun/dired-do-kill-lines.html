</br>
</br>
(dired-do-kill-lines &optional <u>ARG</u> <u>FMT</u>)</br>
</br>
Kill all marked lines (not the files).</br>
With a prefix argument, kill that many lines starting with the current line.</br>
(A negative argument kills backward.)</br>
If you use this command with a prefix argument to kill the line</br>
for a file that is a directory, which you have inserted in the</br>
Dired buffer as a subdirectory, then it deletes that subdirectory</br>
from the buffer as well.</br>
To kill an entire subdirectory (without killing its line in the</br>
parent directory), go to its directory header line and use this</br>
command with a prefix argument (the value does not matter).<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
