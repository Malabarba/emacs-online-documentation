<strong>dired-do-kill-lines</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dired-do-kill-lines &optional ARG FMT)<br/>
<br/>
Kill all marked lines (not the files).<br/>
With a prefix argument, kill that many lines starting with the current line.<br/>
(A negative argument kills backward.)<br/>
If you use this command with a prefix argument to kill the line<br/>
for a file that is a directory, which you have inserted in the<br/>
Dired buffer as a subdirectory, then it deletes that subdirectory<br/>
from the buffer as well.<br/>
To kill an entire subdirectory (without killing its line in the<br/>
parent directory), go to its directory header line and use this<br/>
command with a prefix argument (the value does not matter).
