dired-do-redisplay is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `dired-aux.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-do-redisplay &optional ARG TEST-FOR-SUBDIR)<br/><br/>Redisplay all marked (or next ARG) files.<br/>If on a subdir line, redisplay that subdirectory.  In that case,<br/>a prefix arg lets you edit the `ls' switches used for the new listing.<br/><br/>Dired remembers switches specified with a prefix arg, so that reverting<br/>the buffer will not reset them.  However, using `dired-undo' to re-insert<br/>or delete subdirectories can bypass this machinery.  Hence, you sometimes<br/>may have to reset some subdirectory switches after a `dired-undo'.<br/>You can reset all subdirectory switches to the default using<br/>M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches.<br/>See Info node `(emacs)Subdir switches' for more details.
