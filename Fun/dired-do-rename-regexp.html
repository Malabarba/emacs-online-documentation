Otherwise, it operates on all the marked files, or the current<br/>file if none are marked.<br/><br/>As each match is found, the user must type a character saying<br/>  what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.<br/>NEWNAME may contain \<n> or \& as in `query-replace-regexp'.<br/>REGEXP defaults to the last regexp used.<br/><br/>With a zero prefix arg, renaming by regexp affects the absolute file name.<br/>Normally, only the non-directory part of the file name is used and changed.
