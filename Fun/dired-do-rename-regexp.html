<strong>dired-do-rename-regexp</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(dired-do-rename-regexp <u>REGEXP</u> <u>NEWNAME</u> &optional <u>ARG</u> <u>WHOLE-NAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Rename selected files whose names match <u>REGEXP</u> to <u>NEWNAME</u>.</br>
</br>
With non-zero prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, the command operates on the next <u>ARG</u></br>
files.  Otherwise, it operates on all the marked files, or the current</br>
file if none are marked.</br>
</br>
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying</br>
  what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.</br>
<u>NEWNAME</u> may contain \&lt;n> or \& as in `query-replace-regexp'.</br>
<u>REGEXP</u> defaults to the last regexp used.</br>
</br>
With a zero prefix arg, renaming by regexp affects the absolute file name.</br>
Normally, only the non-directory part of the file name is used and changed.
