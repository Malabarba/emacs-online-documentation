<strong>dired-do-shell-command</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dired-do-shell-command COMMAND &optional ARG FILE-LIST)<br/>
<br/>
Run a shell command COMMAND on the marked files.<br/>
If no files are marked or a numeric prefix arg is given,<br/>
the next ARG files are used.  Just C-u means the current file.<br/>
The prompt mentions the file(s) or the marker, as appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a `*' in COMMAND, surrounded by whitespace, this runs<br/>
COMMAND just once with the entire file list substituted there.<br/>
<br/>
If there is no `*', but there is a `?' in COMMAND, surrounded by<br/>
whitespace, this runs COMMAND on each file individually with the<br/>
file name substituted for `?'.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, this runs COMMAND on each file individually with the<br/>
file name added at the end of COMMAND (separated by a space).<br/>
<br/>
`*' and `?' when not surrounded by whitespace have no special<br/>
significance for `dired-do-shell-command', and are passed through<br/>
normally to the shell, but you must confirm first.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use `*' as a shell wildcard with whitespace around<br/>
it, write `*""' in place of just `*'.  This is equivalent to just<br/>
`*' in the shell, but avoids Dired's special handling.<br/>
<br/>
If COMMAND ends in `&', `;', or `;&', it is executed in the<br/>
background asynchronously, and the output appears in the buffer<br/>
`*Async Shell Command*'.  When operating on multiple files and COMMAND<br/>
ends in `&', the shell command is executed on each file in parallel.<br/>
However, when COMMAND ends in `;' or `;&' then commands are executed<br/>
in the background on each file sequentially waiting for each command<br/>
to terminate before running the next command.  You can also use<br/>
`dired-do-async-shell-command' that automatically adds `&'.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, COMMAND is executed synchronously, and the output<br/>
appears in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.<br/>
<br/>
This feature does not try to redisplay Dired buffers afterward, as<br/>
there's no telling what files COMMAND may have changed.<br/>
Type M-x dired-do-redisplay to redisplay the marked files.<br/>
<br/>
When COMMAND runs, its working directory is the top-level directory<br/>
of the Dired buffer, so output files usually are created there<br/>
instead of in a subdir.<br/>
<br/>
In a noninteractive call (from Lisp code), you must specify<br/>
the list of file names explicitly with the FILE-LIST argument, which<br/>
can be produced by `dired-get-marked-files', for example.
