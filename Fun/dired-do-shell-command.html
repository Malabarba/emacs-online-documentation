<!DOCTYPE html><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en-us"><head><style type="text/css"> @import url('http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual.css');</style></head><body style="padding:1rem;"><strong>dired-do-shell-command</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(dired-do-shell-command <u>COMMAND</u> &optional <u>ARG</u> <u>FILE-LIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Run a shell command <u>COMMAND</u> on the marked files.</br>
If no files are marked or a numeric prefix arg is given,</br>
the next <u>ARG</u> files are used.  Just C-u means the current file.</br>
The prompt mentions the file(s) or the marker, as appropriate.</br>
</br>
If there is a `*' in <u>COMMAND</u>, surrounded by whitespace, this runs</br>
<u>COMMAND</u> just once with the entire file list substituted there.</br>
</br>
If there is no `*', but there is a `?' in <u>COMMAND</u>, surrounded by</br>
whitespace, this runs <u>COMMAND</u> on each file individually with the</br>
file name substituted for `?'.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, this runs <u>COMMAND</u> on each file individually with the</br>
file name added at the end of <u>COMMAND</u> (separated by a space).</br>
</br>
`*' and `?' when not surrounded by whitespace have no special</br>
significance for `dired-do-shell-command', and are passed through</br>
normally to the shell, but you must confirm first.</br>
</br>
If you want to use `*' as a shell wildcard with whitespace around</br>
it, write `*""' in place of just `*'.  This is equivalent to just</br>
`*' in the shell, but avoids Dired's special handling.</br>
</br>
If <u>COMMAND</u> ends in `&', `;', or `;&', it is executed in the</br>
background asynchronously, and the output appears in the buffer</br>
`*Async Shell Command*'.  When operating on multiple files and <u>COMMAND</u></br>
ends in `&', the shell command is executed on each file in parallel.</br>
However, when <u>COMMAND</u> ends in `;' or `;&' then commands are executed</br>
in the background on each file sequentially waiting for each command</br>
to terminate before running the next command.  You can also use</br>
`dired-do-async-shell-command' that automatically adds `&'.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, <u>COMMAND</u> is executed synchronously, and the output</br>
appears in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.</br>
</br>
This feature does not try to redisplay Dired buffers afterward, as</br>
there's no telling what files <u>COMMAND</u> may have changed.</br>
Type M-x dired-do-redisplay to redisplay the marked files.</br>
</br>
When <u>COMMAND</u> runs, its working directory is the top-level directory</br>
of the Dired buffer, so output files usually are created there</br>
instead of in a subdir.</br>
</br>
In a noninteractive call (from Lisp code), you must specify</br>
the list of file names explicitly with the <u>FILE-LIST</u> argument, which</br>
can be produced by `dired-get-marked-files', for example.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
