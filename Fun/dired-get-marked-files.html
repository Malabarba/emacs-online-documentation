<strong>dired-get-marked-files</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dired-get-marked-files &optional LOCALP ARG FILTER DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED)<br/>
<br/>
Return the marked files' names as list of strings.<br/>
The list is in the same order as the buffer, that is, the car is the<br/>
  first marked file.<br/>
Values returned are normally absolute file names.<br/>
Optional arg LOCALP as in `dired-get-filename'.<br/>
Optional second argument ARG, if non-nil, specifies files near<br/>
 point instead of marked files.  It usually comes from the prefix<br/>
 argument.<br/>
  If ARG is an integer, use the next ARG files.<br/>
  Any other non-nil value means to use the current file instead.<br/>
Optional third argument FILTER, if non-nil, is a function to select<br/>
  some of the files--those for which (funcall FILTER FILENAME) is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
If DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED is non-nil, then if we find just one marked file,<br/>
return (t FILENAME) instead of (FILENAME).<br/>
Don't use that together with FILTER.
