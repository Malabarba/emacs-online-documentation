<strong>dired-get-marked-files</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(dired-get-marked-files &optional <u>LOCALP</u> <u>ARG</u> <u>FILTER</u> <u>DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the marked files' names as list of strings.</br>
The list is in the same order as the buffer, that is, the car is the</br>
  first marked file.</br>
Values returned are normally absolute file names.</br>
Optional arg <u>LOCALP</u> as in `dired-get-filename'.</br>
Optional second argument <u>ARG</u>, if non-nil, specifies files near</br>
 point instead of marked files.  It usually comes from the prefix</br>
 argument.</br>
  If <u>ARG</u> is an integer, use the next <u>ARG</u> files.</br>
  If <u>ARG</u> is any other non-nil value, return the current file name.</br>
  If no files are marked, and <u>ARG</u> is nil, also return the current file name.</br>
Optional third argument <u>FILTER</u>, if non-nil, is a function to select</br>
  some of the files--those for which (funcall <u>FILTER</u> FILENAME) is non-nil.</br>
</br>
If <u>DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED</u> is non-nil, then if we find just one marked file,</br>
return (t FILENAME) instead of (FILENAME).</br>
Don't use that together with <u>FILTER</u>.
