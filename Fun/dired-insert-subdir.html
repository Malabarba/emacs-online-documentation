<strong>dired-insert-subdir</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-aux.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(dired-insert-subdir <u>DIRNAME</u> &optional <u>SWITCHES</u> <u>NO-ERROR-IF-NOT-DIR-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert this subdirectory into the same Dired buffer.</br>
If it is already present, overwrite the previous entry;</br>
  otherwise, insert it at its natural place (as `ls -lR' would</br>
  have done).</br>
With a prefix arg, you may edit the `ls' switches used for this listing.</br>
  You can add `R' to the switches to expand the whole tree starting at</br>
  this subdirectory.</br>
This function takes some pains to conform to `ls -lR' output.
