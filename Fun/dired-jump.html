<strong>dired-jump</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired-x.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x C-j.<br/>
<br/>
(dired-jump &optional OTHER-WINDOW FILE-NAME)<br/>
<br/>
Jump to dired buffer corresponding to current buffer.<br/>
If in a file, dired the current directory and move to file's line.<br/>
If in Dired already, pop up a level and goto old directory's line.<br/>
In case the proper dired file line cannot be found, refresh the dired<br/>
buffer and try again.<br/>
When OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, jump to dired buffer in other window.<br/>
Interactively with prefix argument, read FILE-NAME and<br/>
move to its line in dired.
