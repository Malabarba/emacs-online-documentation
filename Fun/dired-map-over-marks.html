dired-map-over-marks is a Lisp macro in `dired.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-map-over-marks BODY ARG &optional SHOW-PROGRESS DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED)<br/><br/>Eval BODY with point on each marked line.  Return a list of BODY's results.<br/>If no marked file could be found, execute BODY on the current<br/>line.  ARG, if non-nil, specifies the files to use instead of the<br/>marked files.<br/><br/>If ARG is an integer, use the next ARG (or previous -ARG, if<br/>ARG<0) files.  In that case, point is dragged along.  This is so<br/>that commands on the next ARG (instead of the marked) files can<br/>be chained easily.<br/>For any other non-nil value of ARG, use the current file.<br/><br/>If optional third arg SHOW-PROGRESS evaluates to non-nil,<br/>redisplay the dired buffer after each file is processed.<br/><br/>No guarantee is made about the position on the marked line.  BODY<br/>must ensure this itself if it depends on this.<br/><br/>Search starts at the beginning of the buffer, thus the car of the<br/>list corresponds to the line nearest to the buffer's bottom.<br/>This is also true for (positive and negative) integer values of<br/>ARG.<br/><br/>BODY should not be too long as it is expanded four times.<br/><br/>If DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED is non-nil, then if we find just one<br/>marked file, return (t FILENAME) instead of (FILENAME).
