<strong>dired-map-over-marks</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>dired.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(dired-map-over-marks <u>BODY</u> <u>ARG</u> &optional <u>SHOW-PROGRESS</u> <u>DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED</u>)</br>
</br>
Eval <u>BODY</u> with point on each marked line.  Return a list of <u>BODY</u>'s results.</br>
If no marked file could be found, execute <u>BODY</u> on the current</br>
line.  <u>ARG</u>, if non-nil, specifies the files to use instead of the</br>
marked files.</br>
</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is an integer, use the next <u>ARG</u> (or previous -<u>ARG</u>, if</br>
<u>ARG</u>&lt;0) files.  In that case, point is dragged along.  This is so</br>
that commands on the next <u>ARG</u> (instead of the marked) files can</br>
be chained easily.</br>
For any other non-nil value of <u>ARG</u>, use the current file.</br>
</br>
If optional third arg <u>SHOW-PROGRESS</u> evaluates to non-nil,</br>
redisplay the dired buffer after each file is processed.</br>
</br>
No guarantee is made about the position on the marked line.</br>
<u>BODY</u> must ensure this itself if it depends on this.</br>
</br>
Search starts at the beginning of the buffer, thus the car of the</br>
list corresponds to the line nearest to the buffer's bottom.</br>
This is also true for (positive and negative) integer values of</br>
<u>ARG</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>BODY</u> should not be too long as it is expanded four times.</br>
</br>
If <u>DISTINGUISH-ONE-MARKED</u> is non-nil, then if we find just one</br>
marked file, return (t FILENAME) instead of (FILENAME).
