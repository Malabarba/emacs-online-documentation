<strong>dired-mark-pop-up</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dired-mark-pop-up BUFFER-OR-NAME OP-SYMBOL FILES FUNCTION &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Return FUNCTION's result on ARGS after showing which files are marked.<br/>
Displays the file names in a window showing a buffer named<br/>
BUFFER-OR-NAME; the default name being " *Marked Files*".  The<br/>
window is not shown if there is just one file, `dired-no-confirm'<br/>
is t, or OP-SYMBOL is a member of the list in `dired-no-confirm'.<br/>
<br/>
By default, Dired shrinks the display buffer to fit the marked files.<br/>
To disable this, use the Customization interface to add a new rule<br/>
to `display-buffer-alist' where condition regexp is "^ \*Marked Files\*$",<br/>
action argument symbol is `window-height' and its value is nil.<br/>
<br/>
FILES is the list of marked files.  It can also be (t FILENAME)<br/>
in the case of one marked file, to distinguish that from using<br/>
just the current file.<br/>
<br/>
FUNCTION should not manipulate files, just read input (an<br/>
argument or confirmation).
