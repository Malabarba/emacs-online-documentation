<strong>dired-mark-pop-up</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(dired-mark-pop-up <u>BUFFER-OR-NAME</u> <u>OP-SYMBOL</u> <u>FILES</u> <u>FUNCTION</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return <u>FUNCTION</u>'s result on <u>ARGS</u> after showing which files are marked.</br>
Displays the file names in a window showing a buffer named</br>
<u>BUFFER-OR-NAME</u>; the default name being " *Marked Files*".  The</br>
window is not shown if there is just one file, `dired-no-confirm'</br>
is t, or <u>OP-SYMBOL</u> is a member of the list in `dired-no-confirm'.</br>
</br>
By default, Dired shrinks the display buffer to fit the marked files.</br>
To disable this, use the Customization interface to add a new rule</br>
to `display-buffer-alist' where condition regexp is "^ \*Marked Files\*$",</br>
action argument symbol is `window-height' and its value is nil.</br>
</br>
<u>FILES</u> is the list of marked files.  It can also be (t FILENAME)</br>
in the case of one marked file, to distinguish that from using</br>
just the current file.</br>
</br>
<u>FUNCTION</u> should not manipulate files, just read input (an</br>
argument or confirmation).
