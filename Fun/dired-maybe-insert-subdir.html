dired-maybe-insert-subdir is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `dired-aux.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-maybe-insert-subdir DIRNAME &optional SWITCHES NO-ERROR-IF-NOT-DIR-P)<br/><br/>Insert this subdirectory into the same dired buffer.<br/>If it is already present, just move to it (type M-x dired-do-redisplay to refresh),<br/>  else inserts it at its natural place (as `ls -lR' would have done).<br/>With a prefix arg, you may edit the ls switches used for this listing.<br/>  You can add `R' to the switches to expand the whole tree starting at<br/>  this subdirectory.<br/>This function takes some pains to conform to `ls -lR' output.<br/><br/>Dired remembers switches specified with a prefix arg, so that reverting<br/>the buffer will not reset them.  However, using `dired-undo' to re-insert<br/>or delete subdirectories can bypass this machinery.  Hence, you sometimes<br/>may have to reset some subdirectory switches after a `dired-undo'.<br/>You can reset all subdirectory switches to the default using<br/>M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches.<br/>See Info node `(emacs)Subdir switches' for more details.
