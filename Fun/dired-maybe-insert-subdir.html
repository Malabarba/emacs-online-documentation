</br>
</br>
(dired-maybe-insert-subdir <u>DIRNAME</u> &optional <u>SWITCHES</u> <u>NO-ERROR-IF-NOT-DIR-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert this subdirectory into the same dired buffer.</br>
If it is already present, just move to it (type M-x dired-do-redisplay to refresh),</br>
  else inserts it at its natural place (as `ls -lR' would have done).</br>
With a prefix arg, you may edit the ls switches used for this listing.</br>
  You can add `R' to the switches to expand the whole tree starting at</br>
  this subdirectory.</br>
This function takes some pains to conform to `ls -lR' output.</br>
</br>
Dired remembers switches specified with a prefix arg, so that reverting</br>
the buffer will not reset them.  However, using `dired-undo' to re-insert</br>
or delete subdirectories can bypass this machinery.  Hence, you sometimes</br>
may have to reset some subdirectory switches after a `dired-undo'.</br>
You can reset all subdirectory switches to the default using</br>
M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches.</br>
