<strong>dired-readin</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dired-readin)<br/>
<br/>
Read in a new dired buffer.<br/>
Differs from `dired-insert-subdir' in that it accepts<br/>
wildcards, erases the buffer, and builds the subdir-alist anew<br/>
(including making it buffer-local and clearing it first).
