dired-simultaneous-find-file is a compiled Lisp function in `dired-x.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-simultaneous-find-file FILE-LIST NOSELECT)<br/><br/>Visit all files in FILE-LIST and display them simultaneously.<br/>The current window is split across all files in FILE-LIST, as evenly as<br/>possible.  Remaining lines go to the bottom-most window.  The number of<br/>files that can be displayed this way is restricted by the height of the<br/>current window and the variable `window-min-height'.  With non-nil<br/>NOSELECT the files are merely found but not selected.
