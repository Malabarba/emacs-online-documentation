dired-virtual is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `dired-x.el'.<br/><br/>(dired-virtual DIRNAME &optional SWITCHES)<br/><br/>Put this buffer into Virtual Dired mode.<br/><br/>In Virtual Dired mode, all commands that do not actually consult the<br/>filesystem will work.<br/><br/>This is useful if you want to peruse and move around in an ls -lR<br/>output file, for example one you got from an ftp server.  With<br/>ange-ftp, you can even dired a directory containing an ls-lR file,<br/>visit that file and turn on virtual dired mode.  But don't try to save<br/>this file, as dired-virtual indents the listing and thus changes the<br/>buffer.<br/><br/>If you have save a Dired buffer in a file you can use M-x dired-virtual to<br/>resume it in a later session.<br/><br/>Type g in the Virtual Dired buffer and answer `y' to convert<br/>the virtual to a real dired buffer again.  You don't have to do this, though:<br/>you can relist single subdirs using l.
