<strong>dired</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x d, <menu-bar> <file> <dired>.<br/>
<br/>
(dired DIRNAME &optional SWITCHES)<br/>
<br/>
"Edit" directory DIRNAME--delete, rename, print, etc. some files in it.<br/>
Optional second argument SWITCHES specifies the `ls' options used.<br/>
(Interactively, use a prefix argument to be able to specify SWITCHES.)<br/>
Dired displays a list of files in DIRNAME (which may also have<br/>
shell wildcards appended to select certain files).  If DIRNAME is a cons,<br/>
its first element is taken as the directory name and the rest as an explicit<br/>
list of files to make directory entries for.<br/>
You can flag files for deletion with d and then<br/>
delete them by typing x.<br/>
Type h after entering Dired for more info.<br/>
<br/>
If DIRNAME is already in a dired buffer, that buffer is used without refresh.
