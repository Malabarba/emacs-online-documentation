<strong>dired</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>dired.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x d, &lt;menu-bar> &lt;file> &lt;dired>.</br>
</br>
<code>(dired <u>DIRNAME</u> <em>&optional</em> <u>SWITCHES</u></code>)</br>
</br>
"Edit" directory <u>DIRNAME</u>--delete, rename, print, etc. some files in it.</br>
Optional second argument <u>SWITCHES</u> specifies the `ls' options used.</br>
(Interactively, use a prefix argument to be able to specify <u>SWITCHES</u>.)</br>
Dired displays a list of files in <u>DIRNAME</u> (which may also have</br>
shell wildcards appended to select certain files).  If <u>DIRNAME</u> is a cons,</br>
its first element is taken as the directory name and the rest as an explicit</br>
list of files to make directory entries for.</br>
You can flag files for deletion with d and then</br>
delete them by typing x.</br>
Type h after entering Dired for more info.</br>
</br>
If <u>DIRNAME</u> is already in a Dired buffer, that buffer is used without refresh.
