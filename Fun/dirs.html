<strong>dirs</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/shell-resync-dirs.html">shell-resync-dirs</a></strong>' in `<code>shell.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(dirs)</br>
</br>
Resync the buffer's idea of the current directory stack.</br>
This command queries the shell with the command bound to</br>
`shell-dirstack-query' (default "dirs"), reads the next</br>
line output and parses it to form the new directory stack.</br>
DON'T issue this command unless the buffer is at a shell prompt.</br>
Also, note that if some other subprocess decides to do output</br>
immediately after the query, its output will be taken as the</br>
new directory stack -- you lose.  If this happens, just do the</br>
command again.
