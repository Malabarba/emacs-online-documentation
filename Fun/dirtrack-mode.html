dirtrack-mode is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `dirtrack.el'.<br/><br/>(dirtrack-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Toggle directory tracking in shell buffers (Dirtrack mode).<br/>With a prefix argument ARG, enable Dirtrack mode if ARG is<br/>positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br/>the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/><br/>This method requires that your shell prompt contain the current<br/>working directory at all times, and that you set the variable<br/>`dirtrack-list' to match the prompt.<br/><br/>This is an alternative to `shell-dirtrack-mode', which works by<br/>tracking `cd' and similar commands which change the shell working<br/>directory.
