<strong>display-buffer-in-atom-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>

<br/>
Display BUFFER in an atomic window.<br/>
This function displays BUFFER in a new window that will be<br/>
combined with an existing window to form an atomic window.  If<br/>
the existing window is already part of an atomic window, add the<br/>
new window to that atomic window.  Operations like `split-window'<br/>
or `delete-window', when applied to a constituent of an atomic<br/>
window, are applied atomically to the root of that atomic window.<br/>
<br/>
ALIST is an association list of symbols and values.  The<br/>
following symbols can be used.<br/>
<br/>
`window' specifies the existing window the new window shall be<br/>
  combined with.  Use `window-atom-root' to make the new window a<br/>
  sibling of an atomic window's root.  If an internal window is<br/>
  specified here, all children of that window become part of the<br/>
  atomic window too.  If no window is specified, the new window<br/>
  becomes a sibling of the selected window.<br/>
<br/>
`side' denotes the side of the existing window where the new<br/>
  window shall be located.  Valid values are `below', `right',<br/>
  `above' and `left'.  The default is `below'.<br/>
<br/>
The return value is the new window, nil when creating that window<br/>
failed.
