</br>
(display-buffer-record-window <u>TYPE</u> <u>WINDOW</u> <u>BUFFER</u>)</br>
</br>
Record information for window used by `display-buffer'.</br>
<u>TYPE</u> specifies the type of the calling operation and must be one</br>
of the symbols 'reuse (when <u>WINDOW</u> existed already and was</br>
reused for displaying <u>BUFFER</u>), 'window (when <u>WINDOW</u> was created</br>
on an already existing frame), or 'frame (when <u>WINDOW</u> was</br>
created on a new frame).  <u>WINDOW</u> is the window used for or created</br>
by the `display-buffer' routines.  <u>BUFFER</u> is the buffer that</br>
shall be displayed.</br>

This function installs or updates the quit-restore parameter of</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>.  The quit-restore parameter is a list of four elements:</br>
The first element is one of the symbols 'window, 'frame, 'same or</br>
'other.  The second element is either one of the symbols 'window</br>
or 'frame or a list whose elements are the buffer previously</br>
shown in the window, that buffer's window start and window point,</br>
and the window's height.  The third element is the window</br>
selected at the time the parameter was created.  The fourth</br>
element is <u>BUFFER</u>.
