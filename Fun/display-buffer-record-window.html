<strong>display-buffer-record-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(display-buffer-record-window TYPE WINDOW BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Record information for window used by `display-buffer'.<br/>
TYPE specifies the type of the calling operation and must be one<br/>
of the symbols 'reuse (when WINDOW existed already and was<br/>
reused for displaying BUFFER), 'window (when WINDOW was created<br/>
on an already existing frame), or 'frame (when WINDOW was<br/>
created on a new frame).  WINDOW is the window used for or created<br/>
by the `display-buffer' routines.  BUFFER is the buffer that<br/>
shall be displayed.<br/>
<br/>
This function installs or updates the quit-restore parameter of<br/>
WINDOW.  The quit-restore parameter is a list of four elements:<br/>
The first element is one of the symbols 'window, 'frame, 'same or<br/>
'other.  The second element is either one of the symbols 'window<br/>
or 'frame or a list whose elements are the buffer previously<br/>
shown in the window, that buffer's window start and window point,<br/>
and the window's height.  The third element is the window<br/>
selected at the time the parameter was created.  The fourth<br/>
element is BUFFER.
