<strong>display-buffer-same-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(display-buffer-same-window BUFFER ALIST)<br/>
<br/>
Display BUFFER in the selected window.<br/>
This fails if ALIST has a non-nil `inhibit-same-window' entry, or<br/>
if the selected window is a minibuffer window or is dedicated to<br/>
another buffer; in that case, return nil.  Otherwise, return the<br/>
selected window.
