<strong>display-call-tree</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(display-call-tree &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Display a call graph of a specified file.<br/>
This lists which functions have been called, what functions called<br/>
them, and what functions they call.  The list includes all functions<br/>
whose definitions have been compiled in this Emacs session, as well as<br/>
all functions called by those functions.<br/>
<br/>
The call graph does not include macros, inline functions, or<br/>
primitives that the byte-code interpreter knows about directly (eq,<br/>
cons, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
The call tree also lists those functions which are not known to be called<br/>
(that is, to which no calls have been compiled), and which cannot be<br/>
invoked interactively.
