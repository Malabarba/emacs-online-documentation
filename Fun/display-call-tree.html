</br>
</br>
(display-call-tree &optional <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Display a call graph of a specified file.</br>
This lists which functions have been called, what functions called</br>
them, and what functions they call.  The list includes all functions</br>
whose definitions have been compiled in this Emacs session, as well as</br>
all functions called by those functions.</br>
</br>
The call graph does not include macros, inline functions, or</br>
primitives that the byte-code interpreter knows about directly (eq,</br>
cons, etc.).</br>
</br>
The call tree also lists those functions which are not known to be called</br>
(that is, to which no calls have been compiled), and which cannot be</br>
invoked interactively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
