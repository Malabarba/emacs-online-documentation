</br>
(display-monitor-attributes-list &optional <u>DISPLAY</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a list of physical monitor attributes on <u>DISPLAY</u>.</br>
<u>DISPLAY</u> can be a display name, a terminal name, or a frame.</br>
If <u>DISPLAY</u> is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected frame's display.</br>
Each element of the list represents the attributes of a physical</br>
monitor.  The first element corresponds to the primary monitor.</br>
</br>
The attributes for a physical monitor are represented as an alist</br>
of attribute keys and values as follows:</br>
</br>
 geometry -- Position and size in pixels in the form of (X Y WIDTH HEIGHT)</br>
 workarea -- Position and size of the work area in pixels in the</br>
	     form of (X Y WIDTH HEIGHT)</br>
 mm-size  -- Width and height in millimeters in the form of</br>
 	     (WIDTH HEIGHT)</br>
 frames   -- List of frames dominated by the physical monitor</br>
 name (*) -- Name of the physical monitor as a string</br>
 source (*) -- Source of multi-monitor information as a string</br>
</br>
where X, Y, WIDTH, and HEIGHT are integers.  X and Y are coordinates</br>
of the top-left corner, and might be negative for monitors other than</br>
the primary one.  Keys labeled with (*) are optional.</br>
</br>
The "work area" is a measure of the "usable" display space.</br>
It may be less than the total screen size, owing to space taken up</br>
by window manager features (docks, taskbars, etc.).  The precise</br>
details depend on the platform and environment.</br>
</br>
The `source' attribute describes the source from which the information</br>
was obtained.  On X, this may be one of: "Gdk", "XRandr", "Xinerama",</br>
or "fallback".</br>
</br>
A frame is dominated by a physical monitor when either the</br>
largest area of the frame resides in the monitor, or the monitor</br>
is the closest to the frame if the frame does not intersect any</br>
physical monitors.  Every (non-tooltip) frame (including invisible ones)</br>
in a graphical display is dominated by exactly one physical</br>
monitor at a time, though it can span multiple (or no) physical</br>
monitors.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
