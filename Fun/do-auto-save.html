<strong>do-auto-save</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(do-auto-save &optional <u>NO-MESSAGE</u> <u>CURRENT-ONLY</u>)</br>
</br>
Auto-save all buffers that need it.</br>
This is all buffers that have auto-saving enabled</br>
and are changed since last auto-saved.</br>
Auto-saving writes the buffer into a file</br>
so that your editing is not lost if the system crashes.</br>
This file is not the file you visited; that changes only when you save.</br>
Normally we run the normal hook `auto-save-hook' before saving.</br>
</br>
A non-nil <u>NO-MESSAGE</u> argument means do not print any message if successful.</br>
A non-nil <u>CURRENT-ONLY</u> argument means save only current buffer.
