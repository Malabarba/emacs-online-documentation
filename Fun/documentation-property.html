<strong>documentation-property</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(documentation-property <u>SYMBOL</u> <u>PROP</u> &optional <u>RAW</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the documentation string that is <u>SYMBOL</u>'s <u>PROP</u> property.</br>
Third argument <u>RAW</u> omitted or nil means pass the result through</br>
`substitute-command-keys' if it is a string.</br>
</br>
This differs from `get' in that it can refer to strings stored in the</br>
`etc/DOC' file; and that it evaluates documentation properties that</br>
aren't strings.
