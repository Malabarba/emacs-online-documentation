<strong>dont-compile</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>byte-run.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(dont-compile &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
This macro is obsolete since 24.4.</br>
</br>
Like `progn', but the body always runs interpreted (not compiled).</br>
If you think you need this, you're probably making a mistake somewhere.
