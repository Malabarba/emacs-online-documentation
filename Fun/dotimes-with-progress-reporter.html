dotimes-with-progress-reporter is a Lisp macro in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(dotimes-with-progress-reporter (VAR COUNT [RESULT]) MESSAGE BODY...)<br/><br/>Loop a certain number of times and report progress in the echo area.<br/>Evaluate BODY with VAR bound to successive integers running from<br/>0, inclusive, to COUNT, exclusive.  Then evaluate RESULT to get<br/>the return value (nil if RESULT is omitted).<br/><br/>At each iteration MESSAGE followed by progress percentage is<br/>printed in the echo area.  After the loop is finished, MESSAGE<br/>followed by word "done" is printed.  This macro is a<br/>convenience wrapper around `make-progress-reporter' and friends.
