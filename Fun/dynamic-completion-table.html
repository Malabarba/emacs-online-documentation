<strong>dynamic-completion-table</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="completion-table-dynamic">completion-table-dynamic</a></strong>' in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(dynamic-completion-table <u>FUN</u>)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 23.1;</br>
use `completion-table-dynamic' instead.</br>
</br>
Use function <u>FUN</u> as a dynamic completion table.</br>
<u>FUN</u> is called with one argument, the string for which completion is required,</br>
and it should return an alist containing all the intended possible completions.</br>
This alist may be a full list of possible completions so that <u>FUN</u> can ignore</br>
the value of its argument.  If completion is performed in the minibuffer,</br>
<u>FUN</u> will be called in the buffer from which the minibuffer was entered.</br>
</br>
The result of the `completion-table-dynamic' form is a function</br>
that can be used as the COLLECTION argument to `try-completion' and</br>
`all-completions'.  See Info node `(elisp)Programmed Completion'.</br>
