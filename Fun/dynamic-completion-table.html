<strong>dynamic-completion-table</strong> is an alias for `completion-table-dynamic' in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(dynamic-completion-table FUN)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 23.1;<br/>
use `completion-table-dynamic' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Use function FUN as a dynamic completion table.<br/>
FUN is called with one argument, the string for which completion is required,<br/>
and it should return an alist containing all the intended possible completions.<br/>
This alist may be a full list of possible completions so that FUN can ignore<br/>
the value of its argument.  If completion is performed in the minibuffer,<br/>
FUN will be called in the buffer from which the minibuffer was entered.<br/>
<br/>
The result of the `completion-table-dynamic' form is a function<br/>
that can be used as the COLLECTION argument to `try-completion' and<br/>
`all-completions'.  See Info node `(elisp)Programmed Completion'.
