<strong>easy-menu-add-item</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>easymenu.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(easy-menu-add-item <u>MAP</u> <u>PATH</u> <u>ITEM</u> &optional <u>BEFORE</u>)</br>
</br>
To the submenu of <u>MAP</u> with path <u>PATH</u>, add <u>ITEM</u>.</br>
</br>
If an item with the same name is already present in this submenu,</br>
then <u>ITEM</u> replaces it.  Otherwise, <u>ITEM</u> is added to this submenu.</br>
In the latter case, <u>ITEM</u> is normally added at the end of the submenu.</br>
However, if <u>BEFORE</u> is a string and there is an item in the submenu</br>
with that name, then <u>ITEM</u> is added before that item.</br>
</br>
<u>MAP</u> should normally be a keymap; nil stands for the local menu-bar keymap.</br>
It can also be a symbol, which has earlier been used as the first</br>
argument in a call to `easy-menu-define', or the value of such a symbol.</br>
</br>
<u>PATH</u> is a list of strings for locating the submenu where <u>ITEM</u> is to be</br>
added.  If <u>PATH</u> is nil, <u>MAP</u> itself is used.  Otherwise, the first</br>
element should be the name of a submenu directly under <u>MAP</u>.  This</br>
submenu is then traversed recursively with the remaining elements of <u>PATH</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>ITEM</u> is either defined as in `easy-menu-define' or a non-nil value returned</br>
by `easy-menu-item-present-p' or `easy-menu-remove-item' or a menu defined</br>
earlier by `easy-menu-define' or `easy-menu-create-menu'.
