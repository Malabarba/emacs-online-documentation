easy-menu-add-item is a compiled Lisp function in `easymenu.el'.<br/><br/>(easy-menu-add-item MAP PATH ITEM &optional BEFORE)<br/><br/>To the submenu of MAP with path PATH, add ITEM.<br/><br/>If an item with the same name is already present in this submenu,<br/>then ITEM replaces it.  Otherwise, ITEM is added to this submenu.<br/>In the latter case, ITEM is normally added at the end of the submenu.<br/>However, if BEFORE is a string and there is an item in the submenu<br/>with that name, then ITEM is added before that item.<br/><br/>MAP should normally be a keymap; nil stands for the local menu-bar keymap.<br/>It can also be a symbol, which has earlier been used as the first<br/>argument in a call to `easy-menu-define', or the value of such a symbol.<br/><br/>PATH is a list of strings for locating the submenu where ITEM is to be<br/>added.  If PATH is nil, MAP itself is used.  Otherwise, the first<br/>element should be the name of a submenu directly under MAP.  This<br/>submenu is then traversed recursively with the remaining elements of PATH.<br/><br/>ITEM is either defined as in `easy-menu-define' or a non-nil value returned<br/>by `easy-menu-item-present-p' or `easy-menu-remove-item' or a menu defined<br/>earlier by `easy-menu-define' or `easy-menu-create-menu'.
