<strong>easy-menu-change</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>easymenu.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(easy-menu-change <u>PATH</u> <u>NAME</u> <u>ITEMS</u> &optional <u>BEFORE</u> <u>MAP</u>)</br>
</br>
Change menu found at <u>PATH</u> as item <u>NAME</u> to contain <u>ITEMS</u>.</br>
<u>PATH</u> is a list of strings for locating the menu that</br>
should contain a submenu named <u>NAME</u>.</br>
<u>ITEMS</u> is a list of menu items, as in `easy-menu-define'.</br>
These items entirely replace the previous items in that submenu.</br>
</br>
If <u>MAP</u> is specified, it should normally be a keymap; nil stands for the local</br>
menu-bar keymap.  It can also be a symbol, which has earlier been used as the</br>
first argument in a call to `easy-menu-define', or the value of such a symbol.</br>
</br>
If the menu located by <u>PATH</u> has no submenu named <u>NAME</u>, add one.</br>
If the optional argument <u>BEFORE</u> is present, add it just before</br>
the submenu named <u>BEFORE</u>, otherwise add it at the end of the menu.</br>
</br>
To implement dynamic menus, either call this from</br>
`menu-bar-update-hook' or use a menu filter.
