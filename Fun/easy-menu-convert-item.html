<strong>easy-menu-convert-item</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>easymenu.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(easy-menu-convert-item <u>ITEM</u>)</br>
</br>
Memoize the value returned by `easy-menu-convert-item-1' called on <u>ITEM</u>.</br>
This makes key-shortcut-caching work a *lot* better when this</br>
conversion is done from within a filter.</br>
This also helps when the NAME of the entry is recreated each time:</br>
since the menu is built and traversed separately, the lookup</br>
would always fail because the key is `equal' but not `eq'.
