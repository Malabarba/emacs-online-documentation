Similar to `define-key-after'.<br/>If KEY is not nil then delete any duplications.<br/>If ITEM is nil, then delete the definition of KEY.<br/><br/>Optional argument BEFORE is nil or a key in MENU.  If BEFORE is not nil,<br/>put binding before the item in MENU named BEFORE; otherwise,<br/>if a binding for KEY is already present in MENU, just change it;<br/>otherwise put the new binding last in MENU.<br/>BEFORE can be either a string (menu item name) or a symbol<br/>(the fake function key for the menu item).<br/>KEY does not have to be a symbol, and comparison is done with equal.
