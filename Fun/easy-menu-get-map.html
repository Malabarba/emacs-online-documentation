<strong>easy-menu-get-map</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>easymenu.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(easy-menu-get-map MAP PATH &optional TO-MODIFY)<br/>
<br/>
Return a sparse keymap in which to add or remove an item.<br/>
MAP and PATH are as defined in `easy-menu-add-item'.<br/>

TO-MODIFY, if non-nil, is the name of the item the caller<br/>
wants to modify in the map that we return.<br/>
In some cases we use that to select between the local and global maps.
