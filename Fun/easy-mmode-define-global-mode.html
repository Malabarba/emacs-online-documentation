easy-mmode-define-global-mode is an alias for `define-globalized-minor-mode' in `easy-mmode.el'.<br/><br/>(easy-mmode-define-global-mode GLOBAL-MODE MODE TURN-ON &rest KEYS)<br/><br/>Make a global mode GLOBAL-MODE corresponding to buffer-local minor MODE.<br/>TURN-ON is a function that will be called with no args in every buffer<br/>  and that should try to turn MODE on if applicable for that buffer.<br/>KEYS is a list of CL-style keyword arguments.  As the minor mode<br/>  defined by this function is always global, any :global keyword is<br/>  ignored.  Other keywords have the same meaning as in `define-minor-mode',<br/>  which see.  In particular, :group specifies the custom group.<br/>  The most useful keywords are those that are passed on to the<br/>  `defcustom'.  It normally makes no sense to pass the :lighter<br/>  or :keymap keywords to `define-globalized-minor-mode', since these<br/>  are usually passed to the buffer-local version of the minor mode.<br/><br/>If MODE's set-up depends on the major mode in effect when it was<br/>enabled, then disabling and reenabling MODE should make MODE work<br/>correctly with the current major mode.  This is important to<br/>prevent problems with derived modes, that is, major modes that<br/>call another major mode in their body.
