</br>
(easy-mmode-define-navigation <u>BASE</u> <u>RE</u> &optional <u>NAME</u> <u>ENDFUN</u> <u>NARROWFUN</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Define <u>BASE</u>-next and <u>BASE</u>-prev to navigate in the buffer.</br>
<u>RE</u> determines the places the commands should move point to.</br>
<u>NAME</u> should describe the entities matched by <u>RE</u>.  It is used to build</br>
  the docstrings of the two functions.</br>
<u>BASE</u>-next also tries to make sure that the whole entry is visible by</br>
  searching for its end (by calling <u>ENDFUN</u> if provided or by looking for</br>
  the next entry) and recentering if necessary.</br>
<u>ENDFUN</u> should return the end position (with or without moving point).</br>
<u>NARROWFUN</u> non-nil means to check for narrowing before moving, and if</br>
found, do `widen' first and then call <u>NARROWFUN</u> with no args after moving.</br>
<u>BODY</u> is executed after moving to the destination location.
