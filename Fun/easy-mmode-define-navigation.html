<strong>easy-mmode-define-navigation</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>easy-mmode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(easy-mmode-define-navigation BASE RE &optional NAME ENDFUN NARROWFUN &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Define BASE-next and BASE-prev to navigate in the buffer.<br/>
RE determines the places the commands should move point to.<br/>
NAME should describe the entities matched by RE.  It is used to build<br/>
  the docstrings of the two functions.<br/>
BASE-next also tries to make sure that the whole entry is visible by<br/>
  searching for its end (by calling ENDFUN if provided or by looking for<br/>
  the next entry) and recentering if necessary.<br/>
ENDFUN should return the end position (with or without moving point).<br/>
NARROWFUN non-nil means to check for narrowing before moving, and if<br/>
found, do `widen' first and then call NARROWFUN with no args after moving.<br/>
BODY is executed after moving to the destination location.
