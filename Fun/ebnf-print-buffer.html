<strong>ebnf-print-buffer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebnf2ps.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ebnf-print-buffer &optional <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Generate and print a PostScript syntactic chart image of the buffer.</br>
</br>
When called with a numeric prefix argument (C-u), prompts the user for</br>
the name of a file to save the PostScript image in, instead of sending</br>
it to the printer.</br>
</br>
More specifically, the <u>FILENAME</u> argument is treated as follows: if it</br>
is nil, send the image to the printer.  If <u>FILENAME</u> is a string, save</br>
the PostScript image in a file with that name.  If <u>FILENAME</u> is a</br>
number, prompt the user for the name of the file to save in.
