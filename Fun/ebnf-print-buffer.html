<strong>ebnf-print-buffer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebnf2ps.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ebnf-print-buffer &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Generate and print a PostScript syntactic chart image of the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
When called with a numeric prefix argument (C-u), prompts the user for<br/>
the name of a file to save the PostScript image in, instead of sending<br/>
it to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically, the FILENAME argument is treated as follows: if it<br/>
is nil, send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save<br/>
the PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is a<br/>
number, prompt the user for the name of the file to save in.
