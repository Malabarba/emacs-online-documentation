<strong>ebrowse-base-classes</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebrowse.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ebrowse-base-classes TREE)<br/>
<br/>
Return list of base-classes of TREE by searching subclass lists.<br/>
This function must be used instead of the struct slot<br/>
`base-classes' to access the base-class list directly because it<br/>
computes this information lazily.
