<strong>ebrowse-base-classes</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebrowse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ebrowse-base-classes <u>TREE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return list of base-classes of <u>TREE</u> by searching subclass lists.</br>
This function must be used instead of the struct slot</br>
`base-classes' to access the base-class list directly because it</br>
computes this information lazily.
