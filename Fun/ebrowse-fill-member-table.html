</br>
(ebrowse-fill-member-table)</br>
</br>
Return an obarray holding all members of all classes in the current tree.</br>
</br>
For each member, a symbol is added to the obarray.  Members are</br>
extracted from the buffer-local tree `ebrowse--tree-obarray'.</br>
</br>
Each symbol has its property `ebrowse-info' set to a list (TREE MEMBER-LIST</br>
MEMBER) where TREE is the tree in which the member is defined,</br>
MEMBER-LIST is a symbol describing the member list in which the member</br>
is found, and MEMBER is a MEMBER structure describing the member.</br>
</br>
The slot `member-table' of the buffer-local header structure of</br>
type `ebrowse-hs' is set to the resulting obarray.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
