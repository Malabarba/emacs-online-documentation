<strong>ebrowse-insert-supers</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebrowse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ebrowse-insert-supers <u>TREE</u> <u>CLASSES</u>)</br>
</br>
Build base class lists in class tree <u>TREE</u>.</br>
<u>CLASSES</u> is an obarray used to collect classes.</br>
</br>
Helper function for `ebrowse-build-tree-obarray'.  Base classes should</br>
be ordered so that immediate base classes come first, then the base</br>
class of the immediate base class and so on.  This means that we must</br>
construct the base-class list top down with adding each level at the</br>
beginning of the base-class list.</br>
</br>
We have to be cautious here not to end up in an infinite recursion</br>
if for some reason a circle is in the inheritance graph.
