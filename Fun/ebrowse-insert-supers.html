ebrowse-insert-supers is a compiled Lisp function in `ebrowse.el'.<br/><br/>(ebrowse-insert-supers TREE CLASSES)<br/><br/>Build base class lists in class tree TREE.<br/>CLASSES is an obarray used to collect classes.<br/><br/>Helper function for `ebrowse-build-tree-obarray'.  Base classes should<br/>be ordered so that immediate base classes come first, then the base<br/>class of the immediate base class and so on.  This means that we must<br/>construct the base-class list top down with adding each level at the<br/>beginning of the base-class list.<br/><br/>We have to be cautious here not to end up in an infinite recursion<br/>if for some reason a circle is in the inheritance graph.
