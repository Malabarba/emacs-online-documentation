<strong>ebrowse-tags-view/find-member-decl/defn</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebrowse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ebrowse-tags-view/find-member-decl/defn <u>PREFIX</u> &key <u>VIEW</u> <u>DEFINITION</u> <u>MEMBER-NAME</u>)</br>
</br>
If <u>VIEW</u> is t, view, else find an occurrence of <u>MEMBER-NAME</u>.</br>
</br>
If <u>DEFINITION</u> is t, find or view the member definition else its</br>
declaration.  This function reads the member's name from the</br>
current buffer like FIND-TAG.  It then prepares a completion list</br>
of all classes containing a member with the given name and lets</br>
the user choose the class to use.  As a last step, a tags search</br>
is performed that positions point on the member declaration or</br>
definition.
