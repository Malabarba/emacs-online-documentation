<strong>ebrowse-view/find-file-and-search-pattern</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebrowse.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ebrowse-view/find-file-and-search-pattern STRUC INFO FILE TAGS-FILE &optional VIEW WHERE)<br/>
<br/>
Find or view a member or class.<br/>
STRUC is an `ebrowse-bs' structure (or a structure including that)<br/>
describing what to search.<br/>
INFO is a list (HEADER MEMBER-OR-CLASS ACCESSOR).  HEADER is the<br/>
header structure of a class tree.  MEMBER-OR-CLASS is either an<br/>
`ebrowse-ms' or `ebrowse-cs' structure depending on what is searched.<br/>
ACCESSOR is an accessor function for the member list of a member<br/>
if MEMBER-OR-CLASS is an `ebrowse-ms'.<br/>
FILE is the file to search the member in.<br/>
FILE is not taken out of STRUC here because the filename in STRUC<br/>
may be nil in which case the filename of the class description is used.<br/>
TAGS-FILE is the name of the BROWSE file from which the<br/>
tree was loaded.<br/>
If VIEW is non-nil, view file else find the file.<br/>
WHERE is either `other-window', `other-frame' or `this-window' and<br/>
specifies where to find/view the result.
