<u>STRUC</u> is an `ebrowse-bs' structure (or a structure including that)</br>
describing what to search.</br>

header structure of a class tree.  MEMBER-OR-CLASS is either an</br>
`ebrowse-ms' or `ebrowse-cs' structure depending on what is searched.</br>
ACCESSOR is an accessor function for the member list of a member</br>
if MEMBER-OR-CLASS is an `ebrowse-ms'.</br>
<u>FILE</u> is the file to search the member in.</br>
<u>FILE</u> is not taken out of <u>STRUC</u> here because the filename in <u>STRUC</u></br>
may be nil in which case the filename of the class description is used.</br>
<u>TAGS-FILE</u> is the name of the BROWSE file from which the</br>
tree was loaded.</br>
If <u>VIEW</u> is non-nil, view file else find the file.</br>
<u>WHERE</u> is either `other-window', `other-frame' or `this-window' and</br>
specifies where to find/view the result.
