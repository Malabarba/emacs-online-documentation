<strong>ede--detect-scan-directory-for-project-root</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>detect.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ede--detect-scan-directory-for-project-root <u>DIRECTORY</u> <u>AUTO</u>)</br>
</br>
If <u>DIRECTORY</u> has already been detected with <u>AUTO</u>, find the root.</br>
Some projects have their dominating file in all their directories, such</br>
as Project.ede.  In that case we will detect quickly, but then need</br>
to scan upward to find the topmost occurrence of that file.
