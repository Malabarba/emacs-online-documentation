<strong>ede-directory-safe-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ede.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ede-directory-safe-p <u>DIR</u>)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if <u>DIR</u> is a safe directory to load projects from.</br>
Projects that do not load a project definition as Emacs Lisp code</br>
are safe, and can be loaded automatically.  Other project types,</br>
such as those created with Project.ede files, are safe only if</br>
specified by `ede-project-directories'.
