<strong>edebug-`</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="%60">`</a></strong>' in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(edebug-\` <u>STRUCTURE</u>)</br>
</br>
Argument <u>STRUCTURE</u> describes a template to build.</br>
</br>
The whole structure acts as if it were quoted except for certain</br>
places where expressions are evaluated and inserted or spliced in.</br>
</br>
For example:</br>
</br>
b              => (ba bb bc)		; assume b has this value</br>
`(a b c)       => (a b c)		; backquote acts like quote</br>
`(a ,b c)      => (a (ba bb bc) c)	; insert the value of b</br>
`(a ,@b c)     => (a ba bb bc c)	; splice in the value of b</br>
</br>
Vectors work just like lists.  Nested backquotes are permitted.
