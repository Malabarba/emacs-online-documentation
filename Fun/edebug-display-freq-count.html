</br>
Display the frequency count data for each line of the current definition.</br>
The frequency counts are inserted as comment lines after each line,</br>
and you can undo all insertions with one `undo' command.</br>
</br>
The counts are inserted starting under the `(' before an expression</br>
or the `)' after an expression, or on the last char of a symbol.</br>
The counts are only displayed when they differ from previous counts on</br>
the same line.</br>
</br>
If coverage is being tested, whenever all known results of an expression</br>
are `eq', the char `=' will be appended after the count</br>
for that expression.  Note that this is always the case for an</br>
expression only evaluated once.</br>

To clear the frequency count and coverage data for a definition,</br>
