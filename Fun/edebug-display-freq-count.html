edebug-display-freq-count is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `edebug.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x X =.<br/><br/>(edebug-display-freq-count)<br/><br/>Display the frequency count data for each line of the current definition.<br/>The frequency counts are inserted as comment lines after each line,<br/>and you can undo all insertions with one `undo' command.<br/><br/>The counts are inserted starting under the `(' before an expression<br/>or the `)' after an expression, or on the last char of a symbol.<br/>The counts are only displayed when they differ from previous counts on<br/>the same line.<br/><br/>If coverage is being tested, whenever all known results of an expression<br/>are `eq', the char `=' will be appended after the count<br/>for that expression.  Note that this is always the case for an<br/>expression only evaluated once.<br/><br/>To clear the frequency count and coverage data for a definition,<br/>reinstrument it.
