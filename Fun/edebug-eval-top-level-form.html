<strong>edebug-eval-top-level-form</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(edebug-eval-top-level-form)</br>
</br>
Evaluate the top level form point is in, stepping through with Edebug.</br>
This is like `eval-defun' except that it steps the code for Edebug</br>
before evaluating it.  It displays the value in the echo area</br>
using `eval-expression' (which see).</br>
</br>
If you do this on a function definition such as a defun or defmacro,</br>
it defines the function and instruments its definition for Edebug,</br>
so it will do Edebug stepping when called later.  It displays</br>
`Edebug: FUNCTION' in the echo area to indicate that FUNCTION is now</br>
instrumented for Edebug.</br>
</br>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',</br>
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value</br>
expression even if the variable already has some other value.</br>
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there</br>
already is one.)
