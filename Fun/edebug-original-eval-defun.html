<strong>edebug-original-eval-defun</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(edebug-original-eval-defun EDEBUG-IT)<br/>
<br/>
Evaluate the top-level form containing point, or after point.<br/>
<br/>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',<br/>
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value<br/>
expression even if the variable already has some other value.<br/>
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there<br/>
already is one.)  In an analogous way, evaluating a `defface'<br/>
overrides any customizations of the face, so that it becomes<br/>
defined exactly as the `defface' expression says.<br/>
<br/>
If `eval-expression-debug-on-error' is non-nil, which is the default,<br/>
this command arranges for all errors to enter the debugger.<br/>
<br/>
With a prefix argument, instrument the code for Edebug.<br/>
<br/>
If acting on a `defun' for FUNCTION, and the function was<br/>
instrumented, `Edebug: FUNCTION' is printed in the minibuffer.  If not<br/>
instrumented, just FUNCTION is printed.<br/>
<br/>
If not acting on a `defun', the result of evaluation is displayed in<br/>
the minibuffer.  This display is controlled by the variables<br/>
`eval-expression-print-length' and `eval-expression-print-level',<br/>
which see.
