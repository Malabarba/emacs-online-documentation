edebug-read is a compiled Lisp function in `edebug.el'.<br/><br/>(edebug-read &optional STREAM)<br/><br/>Read one Lisp expression as text from STREAM, return as Lisp object.<br/>If STREAM is nil, use the value of `standard-input' (which see).<br/>STREAM or the value of `standard-input' may be:<br/> a buffer (read from point and advance it)<br/> a marker (read from where it points and advance it)<br/> a function (call it with no arguments for each character,<br/>     call it with a char as argument to push a char back)<br/> a string (takes text from string, starting at the beginning)<br/> t (read text line using minibuffer and use it).<br/><br/>This version, from Edebug, maybe instruments the expression.  But the<br/>STREAM must be the current buffer to do so.  Whether it instruments is<br/>also dependent on the values of `edebug-all-defs' and<br/>`edebug-all-forms'.
