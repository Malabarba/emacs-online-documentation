<strong>edebug-signal</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(edebug-signal SIGNAL-NAME SIGNAL-DATA)<br/>
<br/>
Signal an error.  Args are SIGNAL-NAME, and associated DATA.<br/>
A signal name is a symbol with an `error-conditions' property<br/>
that is a list of condition names.<br/>
A handler for any of those names will get to handle this signal.<br/>
The symbol `error' should always be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
DATA should be a list.  Its elements are printed as part of the error message.<br/>
If the signal is handled, DATA is made available to the handler.<br/>
See `condition-case'.<br/>
<br/>
This is the Edebug replacement for the standard `signal'.  It should<br/>
only be active while Edebug is.  It checks `debug-on-error' to see<br/>
whether it should call the debugger.  When execution is resumed, the<br/>
error is signaled again.
