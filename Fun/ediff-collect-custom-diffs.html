<strong>ediff-collect-custom-diffs</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff-mult.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ediff-collect-custom-diffs)<br/>
<br/>
Collect custom diffs of marked sessions in buffer `*Ediff Multifile Diffs*'.<br/>
This operation is defined only for `ediff-directories' and<br/>
`ediff-directory-revisions', since its intent is to produce<br/>
multifile patches.  For `ediff-directory-revisions', we insist that<br/>
all marked sessions must be active.
