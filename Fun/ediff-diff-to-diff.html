<strong>ediff-diff-to-diff</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ediff-diff-to-diff ARG &optional KEYS)<br/>
<br/>
Copy buffer-X'th difference region to buffer Y (X,Y are A, B, or C).<br/>
If numerical prefix argument, copy the difference specified in the arg.<br/>
Otherwise, copy the difference given by `ediff-current-difference'.<br/>
This command assumes it is bound to a 2-character key sequence, `ab', `ba',<br/>
`ac', etc., which is used to determine the types of buffers to be used for<br/>
copying difference regions.  The first character in the sequence specifies<br/>
the source buffer and the second specifies the target.<br/>
<br/>
If the second optional argument, a 2-character string, is given, use it to<br/>
determine the source and the target buffers instead of the command keys.
