ediff-janitor is a compiled Lisp function in `ediff-util.el'.<br/><br/>(ediff-janitor ASK KEEP-VARIANTS)<br/><br/>Kill buffers A, B, and, possibly, C, if these buffers aren't modified.<br/>In merge jobs, buffer C is not deleted here, but rather according to<br/>ediff-quit-merge-hook.<br/>A side effect of cleaning up may be that you should be careful when comparing<br/>the same buffer in two separate Ediff sessions: quitting one of them might<br/>delete this buffer in another session as well.
