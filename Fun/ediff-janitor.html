<strong>ediff-janitor</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ediff-janitor <u>ASK</u> <u>KEEP-VARIANTS</u>)</br>
</br>
Kill buffers A, B, and, possibly, C, if these buffers aren't modified.</br>
In merge jobs, buffer C is not deleted here, but rather according to</br>
ediff-quit-merge-hook.</br>
A side effect of cleaning up may be that you should be careful when comparing</br>
the same buffer in two separate Ediff sessions: quitting one of them might</br>
delete this buffer in another session as well.
