<strong>ediff-jump-to-difference-at-point</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ediff-jump-to-difference-at-point ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Go to difference closest to the point in buffer A, B, or C.<br/>
The buffer depends on last command character (a, b, or c) that invoked this<br/>
command.  For instance, if the command was `ga' then the point value in buffer<br/>
A is used.<br/>
With a prefix argument, synchronize all files around the current point position<br/>
in the specified buffer.
