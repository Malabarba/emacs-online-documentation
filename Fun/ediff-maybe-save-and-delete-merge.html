<strong>ediff-maybe-save-and-delete-merge</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ediff-maybe-save-and-delete-merge &optional <u>SAVE-AND-CONTINUE</u>)</br>
</br>
Default hook to run on quitting a merge job.</br>
This can also be used to save merge buffer in the middle of an Ediff session.</br>
</br>
If the optional <u>SAVE-AND-CONTINUE</u> argument is non-nil, save merge buffer and</br>
continue.  Otherwise:</br>
If `ediff-autostore-merges' is nil, this does nothing.</br>
If it is t, it saves the merge buffer in the file `ediff-merge-store-file'</br>
or asks the user, if the latter is nil.  It then asks the user whether to</br>
delete the merge buffer.</br>
If `ediff-autostore-merges' is neither nil nor t, the merge buffer is saved</br>
only if this merge job is part of a group, i.e., was invoked from within</br>
`ediff-merge-directories', `ediff-merge-directory-revisions', and such.
