<strong>ediff-patch-buffer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;menu-bar> &lt;tools> &lt;epatch> &lt;ediff-patch-buffer>.</br>
</br>
<code>(ediff-patch-buffer <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u> <u>PATCH-BUF</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Run Ediff by patching the buffer specified at prompt.</br>
Without the optional prefix <u>ARG</u>, asks if the patch is in some buffer and</br>
prompts for the buffer or a file, depending on the answer.</br>
With <u>ARG</u>=1, assumes the patch is in a file and prompts for the file.</br>
With <u>ARG</u>=2, assumes the patch is in a buffer and prompts for the buffer.</br>
<u>PATCH-BUF</u> is an optional argument, which specifies the buffer that contains the</br>
patch. If not given, the user is prompted according to the prefix argument.
