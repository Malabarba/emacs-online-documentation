(ediff-patch-buffer &optional ARG PATCH-BUF)<br/>
<br/>
Run Ediff by patching the buffer specified at prompt.<br/>
Without the optional prefix ARG, asks if the patch is in some buffer and<br/>
prompts for the buffer or a file, depending on the answer.<br/>
With ARG=1, assumes the patch is in a file and prompts for the file.<br/>
With ARG=2, assumes the patch is in a buffer and prompts for the buffer.<br/>
PATCH-BUF is an optional argument, which specifies the buffer that contains the<br/>
patch. If not given, the user is prompted according to the prefix argument.
