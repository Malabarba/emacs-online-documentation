<strong>ediff-quit</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ediff-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ediff-quit <u>REVERSE-DEFAULT-KEEP-VARIANTS</u>)</br>
</br>
Finish an Ediff session and exit Ediff.</br>
Unselects the selected difference, if any, restores the read-only and modified</br>
flags of the compared file buffers, kills Ediff buffers for this session</br>
(but not buffers A, B, C).</br>
</br>
If `ediff-keep-variants' is nil, the user will be asked whether the buffers</br>
containing the variants should be removed (if they haven't been modified).</br>
If it is t, they will be preserved unconditionally.  A prefix argument,</br>
temporarily reverses the meaning of this variable.
