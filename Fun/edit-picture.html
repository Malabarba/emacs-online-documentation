</br>
</br>
(edit-picture)</br>
</br>
Switch to Picture mode, in which a quarter-plane screen model is used.</br>
</br>
Printing characters replace instead of inserting themselves with motion</br>
afterwards settable by these commands:</br>
</br>
 Move left after insertion:            C-c &lt;</br>
 Move right after insertion:           C-c ></br>
 Move up after insertion:              C-c ^</br>
 Move down after insertion:            C-c .</br>
</br>
 Move northwest (nw) after insertion:  C-c `</br>
 Move northeast (ne) after insertion:  C-c '</br>
 Move southwest (sw) after insertion:  C-c /</br>
 Move southeast (se) after insertion:  C-c \</br>
</br>
 Move westnorthwest (wnw) after insertion:  C-u C-c `</br>
 Move eastnortheast (ene) after insertion:  C-u C-c '</br>
 Move westsouthwest (wsw) after insertion:  C-u C-c /</br>
 Move eastsoutheast (ese) after insertion:  C-u C-c \</br>
</br>
The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial</br>
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to</br>
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer</br>
with these commands:</br>
</br>
 Move vertically to SAME column in previous line: C-n</br>
 Move vertically to SAME column in next line:     C-p</br>
 Move to column following last</br>
  non-whitespace character:                       C-e</br>
 Move right, inserting spaces if required:        C-f</br>
 Move left changing tabs to spaces if required:   C-b</br>
 Move in direction of current picture motion:     C-c C-f</br>
 Move opposite to current picture motion:         C-c C-b</br>
 Move to beginning of next line:                  C-n</br>
</br>
You can edit tabular text with these commands:</br>
</br>
 Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting</br>
  character (see variable `picture-tab-chars'):   C-M-i</br>
 Move to next stop in tab stop list:              TAB</br>
 Set tab stops according to context of this line: C-c TAB</br>
   (With ARG, resets tab stops to default value.)</br>
 Change the tab stop list:                        M-x edit-tab-stops</br>
</br>
You can manipulate text with these commands:</br>
 Clear ARG columns after point without moving:    C-d</br>
 Delete char at point:                            C-c C-d</br>
 Clear ARG columns backward:                      DEL</br>
 Clear ARG lines, advancing over them:            C-k</br>
  (the cleared text is saved in the kill ring)</br>
 Open blank line(s) beneath current line:         C-o</br>
</br>
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:</br>
  Clear a rectangle and save it:                  C-c C-k</br>
  Clear a rectangle, saving in a named register:  C-c C-w</br>
  Insert currently saved rectangle at point:      C-c C-y</br>
  Insert rectangle from named register:           C-c C-x</br>
  Draw a rectangular box around mark and point:   C-c C-r</br>
  Copies a rectangle to a register:               C-x r r</br>
  Undo effects of rectangle overlay commands:     C-x u</br>
</br>
You can return to the previous mode with C-c C-c, which</br>
also strips trailing whitespace from every line.  Stripping is suppressed</br>
by supplying an argument.</br>
</br>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `picture-mode-hook' if non-nil.</br>
</br>
Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but</br>
they are not by default assigned to keys.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
