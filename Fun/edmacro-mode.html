edmacro-mode is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `edmacro.el'.<br/><br/>(edmacro-mode)<br/><br/>Keyboard Macro Editing mode.  Press C-c C-c to save and exit.<br/>To abort the edit, just kill this buffer with C-x k RET.<br/><br/>Press C-c C-q to insert the name of any key by typing the key.<br/><br/>The editing buffer contains a "Command:" line and any number of<br/>"Key:" lines at the top.  These are followed by a "Macro:" line<br/>and the macro itself as spelled-out keystrokes: `C-x C-f foo RET'.<br/><br/>The "Command:" line specifies the command name to which the macro<br/>is bound, or "none" for no command name.  Write "last-kbd-macro"<br/>to refer to the current keyboard macro (as used by M-x call-last-kbd-macro).<br/><br/>The "Key:" lines specify key sequences to which the macro is bound,<br/>or "none" for no key bindings.<br/><br/>You can edit these lines to change the places where the new macro<br/>is stored.<br/><br/><br/>Format of keyboard macros during editing:<br/><br/>Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace.  Except for<br/>the words described below, the characters of each word go directly<br/>as characters of the macro.  The whitespace that separates words<br/>is ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly,<br/>as in "foo SPC bar RET".<br/><br/> * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent<br/>   special control characters.  The words must be written in uppercase.<br/><br/> * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, or <f1>, represents<br/>   a function key.  (Note that in the standard configuration, the<br/>   function key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.)<br/>   You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they<br/>   are not required there.<br/><br/> * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed<br/>   by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to represent keys<br/>   with codes above \377.<br/><br/> * One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt),<br/>   H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation.<br/>   For function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the<br/>   brackets:  C-<down> = <C-down>.  The prefixes may be written in<br/>   any order:  M-C-x = C-M-x.<br/><br/>   Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except<br/>   that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional<br/>   minus sign:  M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.<br/><br/> * The `^' notation for control characters also works:  ^M = C-m.<br/><br/> * Double angle brackets enclose command names:  <<next-line>> is<br/>   shorthand for M-x next-line RET.<br/><br/> * Finally, REM or ;; causes the rest of the line to be ignored as a<br/>   comment.<br/><br/>Any word may be prefixed by a multiplier in the form of a decimal<br/>number and `*':  3*<right> = <right> <right> <right>, and<br/>10*foo = foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo.<br/><br/>Multiple text keys can normally be strung together to form a word,<br/>but you may need to add whitespace if the word would look like one<br/>of the above notations:  `; ; ;' is a keyboard macro with three<br/>semicolons, but `;;;' is a comment.  Likewise, `\ 1 2 3' is four<br/>keys but `\123' is a single key written in octal, and `< right >'<br/>is seven keys but `<right>' is a single function key.  When in<br/>doubt, use whitespace.
