following cursor are changed.  Second, if the current direction is BACKUP, then<br/>
the prefix number of character(s) before the cursor are changed.  Accepts a<br/>
positive prefix for the number of characters to change, but the prefix is<br/>
ignored if text selection is active.<br/>
Argument NUM is the numbers of consecutive characters to change.
