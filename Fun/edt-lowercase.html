If text selection IS active, then characters between the cursor and</br>
mark are changed.  If text selection is NOT active, there are two</br>
situations.  If the current direction is ADVANCE, then the word under</br>
the cursor is changed to lower case and the cursor is moved to rest at</br>
the beginning of the next word.  If the current direction is BACKUP,</br>
the word prior to the word under the cursor is changed to lower case</br>
and the cursor is left to rest at the beginning of that word.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
