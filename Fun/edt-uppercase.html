situations.  If the current direction is ADVANCE, then the word under</br>
the cursor is changed to upper case and the cursor is moved to rest at</br>
the beginning of the next word.  If the current direction is BACKUP,</br>
the word prior to the word under the cursor is changed to upper case</br>
and the cursor is left to rest at the beginning of that word.
