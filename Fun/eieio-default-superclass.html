eieio-default-superclass is an  object constructor function in `eieio.el'.</br>
Creates an object of class eieio-default-superclass.</br>
You cannot create a new object of type eieio-default-superclass</br>
</br>
Class description:</br>
eieio-default-superclass is an abstract class in `eieio.el'.</br>
 Children `semantic-analyze-context', `semanticdb-abstract-db-cache', `semanticdb-abstract-cache', `semanticdb-abstract-search-index', `semanticdb-abstract-table', `srecode-compile-state', `srecode-dictionary-compound-value', `srecode-dictionary', `srecode-template-table', `ede-project-autoload', `ede-project-autoload-dirmatch', `eieio-named', `eieio-persistent', `eieio-singleton', `eieio-instance-tracker', `eieio-instance-inheritor', `eieio-speedbar', `eieio-widget-test-class', `semanticdb-typecache', `chart-sequece', `chart-axis', `chart', `auth-source-backend'.</br>
</br>
Default parent class for classes with no specified parent class.</br>
Its slots are automatically adopted by classes with no specified parents.</br>
This class is not stored in the `parent' slot of a class vector.</br>
</br>
Instance Allocated Slots:</br>
</br>
Specialized Methods:</br>
</br>
`object-print' :PRIMARY (this &rest strings)</br>
Pretty printer for object THIS.  Call function `object-name' with STRINGS.</br>
The default method for printing object THIS is to use the</br>
function `object-name'.</br>
</br>
It is sometimes useful to put a summary of the object into the</br>
default #&lt;notation> string when using EIEIO browsing tools.</br>
</br>
Implement this function and specify STRINGS in a call to</br>
`call-next-method' to provide additional summary information.</br>
When passing in extra strings from child classes, always remember</br>
to prepend a space.</br>
</br>
`eieio-custom-widget-insert' :PRIMARY (obj &rest flags)</br>
Insert the widget used for editing object OBJ in the current buffer.</br>
Arguments FLAGS are widget compatible flags.</br>
Must return the created widget.</br>
</br>
`slot-unbound' :PRIMARY (object class slot-name fn)</br>
Slot unbound is invoked during an attempt to reference an unbound slot.</br>
OBJECT is the instance of the object being reference.  CLASS is the</br>
class of OBJECT, and SLOT-NAME is the offending slot.  This function</br>
throws the signal `unbound-slot'.  You can overload this function and</br>
return the value to use in place of the unbound value.</br>
Argument FN is the function signaling this error.</br>
Use `slot-boundp' to determine if a slot is bound or not.</br>
</br>
In CLOS, the argument list is (CLASS OBJECT SLOT-NAME), but</br>
EIEIO can only dispatch on the first argument, so the first two are swapped.</br>
</br>
`eieio-read-customization-group' :PRIMARY (obj)</br>
Do a completing read on the name of a customization group in OBJ.</br>
Return the symbol for the group, or nil</br>
</br>
`eieio-customize-object' :PRIMARY (obj &optional group)</br>
Customize OBJ in a specialized custom buffer.</br>
To override call the `eieio-custom-widget-insert' to just insert the</br>
object widget.</br>
Optional argument GROUP specifies a subgroup of slots to edit as a symbol.</br>
These groups are specified with the `:group' slot flag.</br>
</br>
`slot-missing' :PRIMARY (object slot-name operation &optional new-value)</br>
Method invoked when an attempt to access a slot in OBJECT fails.</br>
SLOT-NAME is the name of the failed slot, OPERATION is the type of access</br>
that was requested, and optional NEW-VALUE is the value that was desired</br>
to be set.</br>
</br>
This method is called from `oref', `oset', and other functions which</br>
directly reference slots in EIEIO objects.</br>
</br>
`eieio-custom-object-apply-reset' :PRIMARY (obj)</br>
Insert an Apply and Reset button into the object editor.</br>
Argument OBJ is the object being customized.</br>
</br>
`eieio-done-customizing' :PRIMARY (obj)</br>
When applying change to a widget, call this method.</br>
This method is called by the default widget-edit commands.</br>
User made commands should also call this method when applying changes.</br>
Argument OBJ is the object that has been customized.</br>
</br>
`shared-initialize' :PRIMARY (obj slots)</br>
Set slots of OBJ with SLOTS which is a list of name/value pairs.</br>
Called from the constructor routine.</br>
</br>
`no-applicable-method' :PRIMARY (object method &rest args)</br>
Called if there are no implementations for OBJECT in METHOD.</br>
OBJECT is the object which has no method implementation.</br>
ARGS are the arguments that were passed to METHOD.</br>
</br>
Implement this for a class to block this signal.  The return</br>
value becomes the return value of the original method call.</br>
</br>
`clone' :PRIMARY (obj &rest params)</br>
Make a copy of OBJ, and then apply PARAMS.</br>
</br>
`object-write' :PRIMARY (this &optional comment)</br>
Write object THIS out to the current stream.</br>
This writes out the vector version of this object.  Complex and recursive</br>
object are discouraged from being written.</br>
  If optional COMMENT is non-nil, include comments when outputting</br>
this object.</br>
</br>
`no-next-method' :PRIMARY (object &rest args)</br>
Called from `call-next-method' when no additional methods are available.</br>
OBJECT is othe object being called on `call-next-method'.</br>
ARGS are the arguments it is called by.</br>
This method signals `no-next-method' by default.  Override this</br>
method to not throw an error, and its return value becomes the</br>
return value of `call-next-method'.</br>
</br>
`constructor' :STATIC (class newname &rest slots)</br>
Default constructor for CLASS `eieio-default-superclass'.</br>
NEWNAME is the name to be given to the constructed object.</br>
SLOTS are the initialization slots used by `shared-initialize'.</br>
This static method is called when an object is constructed.</br>
It allocates the vector used to represent an EIEIO object, and then</br>
calls `shared-initialize' on that object.</br>
</br>
`eieio-customize-object-group' :PRIMARY (obj)</br>
Create a list of vectors for customizing sections of OBJ.</br>
</br>
`initialize-instance' :PRIMARY (this &optional slots)</br>
Construct the new object THIS based on SLOTS.</br>
SLOTS is a tagged list where odd numbered elements are tags, and</br>
even numbered elements are the values to store in the tagged slot.</br>
If you overload the `initialize-instance', there you will need to</br>
call `shared-initialize' yourself, or you can call `call-next-method'</br>
to have this constructor called automatically.  If these steps are</br>
not taken, then new objects of your class will not have their values</br>
dynamically set from SLOTS.</br>
</br>
`destructor' :PRIMARY (this &rest params)</br>
Destructor for cleaning up any dynamic links to our object.</br>
Argument THIS is the object being destroyed.  PARAMS are additional</br>
ignored parameters.</br>
</br>
