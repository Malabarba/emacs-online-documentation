<strong>eieio-generic-call-primary-only</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>eieio-core.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eieio-generic-call-primary-only <u>METHOD</u> <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Call <u>METHOD</u> with <u>ARGS</u> for methods with only :PRIMARY implementations.</br>
<u>ARGS</u> provides the context on which implementation to use.</br>
This should only be called from a generic function.</br>
</br>
This method is like `eieio-generic-call', but only</br>
implementations in the :PRIMARY slot are queried.  After many</br>
years of use, it appears that over 90% of methods in use</br>
have :PRIMARY implementations only.  We can therefore optimize</br>
for this common case to improve performance.
