eieio-generic-call-primary-only is a compiled Lisp function in `eieio.el'.<br/><br/>(eieio-generic-call-primary-only METHOD ARGS)<br/><br/>Call METHOD with ARGS for methods with only :PRIMARY implementations.<br/>ARGS provides the context on which implementation to use.<br/>This should only be called from a generic function.<br/><br/>This method is like `eieio-generic-call', but only<br/>implementations in the :PRIMARY slot are queried.  After many<br/>years of use, it appears that over 90% of methods in use<br/>have :PRIMARY implementations only.  We can therefore optimize<br/>for this common case to improve performance.
