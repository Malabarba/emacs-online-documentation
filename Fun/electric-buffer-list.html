<strong>electric-buffer-list</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ebuff-menu.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(electric-buffer-list ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Pop up the Buffer Menu in an "electric" window.<br/>
If you type SPC or RET (`Electric-buffer-menu-select'), that<br/>
selects the buffer at point and quits the "electric" window.<br/>
Otherwise, you can move around in the Buffer Menu, marking<br/>
buffers to be selected, saved or deleted; these other commands<br/>
are much like those of `Buffer-menu-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
Run hooks in `electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook' on entry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
M-x keyboard-quit or C-c C-c -- exit buffer menu, returning to previous window and buffer<br/>
  configuration.  If the very first character typed is a space, it<br/>
  also has this effect.<br/>
SPC -- select buffer of line point is on.<br/>
  Also show buffers marked with m in other windows,<br/>
  deletes buffers marked with "D", and saves those marked with "S".<br/>
m -- mark buffer to be displayed.<br/>
~ -- clear modified-flag on that buffer.<br/>
s -- mark that buffer to be saved.<br/>
d or C-d -- mark that buffer to be deleted.<br/>
u -- remove all kinds of marks from current line.<br/>
v -- view buffer, returning when done.<br/>
DEL -- back up a line and remove marks.
