<strong>electric-newline-and-maybe-indent</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>electric.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-j.</br>
</br>
<code>(electric-newline-and-maybe-indent</code>)</br>
</br>
Insert a newline.</br>
If `electric-indent-mode' is enabled, that's that, but if it</br>
is *disabled* then additionally indent according to major mode.</br>
Indentation is done using the value of `indent-line-function'.</br>
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.</br>
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this command indents to the</br>
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.
