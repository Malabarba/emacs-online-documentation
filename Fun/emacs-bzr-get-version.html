<strong>emacs-bzr-get-version</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>version.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(emacs-bzr-get-version &optional DIR EXTERNAL)<br/>
<br/>
Try to return as a string the bzr revision of the Emacs sources.<br/>
The format is: [revno] revision_id, where revno may be absent.<br/>
Value is nil if the sources do not seem to be under bzr, or if we could<br/>
not determine the revision.  Note that this reports on the current state<br/>
of the sources, which may not correspond to the running Emacs.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument DIR is a directory to use instead of `source-directory'.<br/>
Optional argument EXTERNAL non-nil means to maybe ask `bzr' itself,<br/>
if the sources appear to be under bzr.  If `force', always ask bzr.<br/>
Otherwise only ask bzr if we cannot find any information ourselves.
