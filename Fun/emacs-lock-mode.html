emacs-lock-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `emacs-lock.el'.<br/><br/>(emacs-lock-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Toggle Emacs Lock mode in the current buffer.<br/>If called with a plain prefix argument, ask for the locking mode<br/>to be used.  With any other prefix ARG, turn mode on if ARG is<br/>positive, off otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if<br/>ARG is omitted or nil.<br/><br/>Initially, if the user does not pass an explicit locking mode, it<br/>defaults to `emacs-lock-default-locking-mode' (which see);<br/>afterwards, the locking mode most recently set on the buffer is<br/>used instead.<br/><br/>When called from Elisp code, ARG can be any locking mode:<br/><br/> exit   -- Emacs cannot exit while the buffer is locked<br/> kill   -- the buffer cannot be killed, but Emacs can exit as usual<br/> all    -- the buffer is locked against both actions<br/><br/>Other values are interpreted as usual.
