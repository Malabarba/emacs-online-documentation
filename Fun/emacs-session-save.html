<strong>emacs-session-save</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>x-win.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(emacs-session-save)<br/>
<br/>
This function is called when the window system is shutting down.<br/>
If this function returns non-nil, the window system shutdown is canceled.<br/>
<br/>
When a session manager tells Emacs that the window system is shutting<br/>
down, this function is called.  It calls the functions in the hook<br/>
`emacs-save-session-functions'.  Functions are called with the current<br/>
buffer set to a temporary buffer.  Functions should use `insert' to insert<br/>
lisp code to save the session state.  The buffer is saved in a file in the<br/>
home directory of the user running Emacs.  The file is evaluated when<br/>
Emacs is restarted by the session manager.<br/>
<br/>
If any of the functions returns non-nil, no more functions are called<br/>
and this function returns non-nil.  This will inform the session manager<br/>
that it should abort the window system shutdown.
