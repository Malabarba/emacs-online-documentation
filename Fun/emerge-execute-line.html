<strong>emerge-execute-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>emerge.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(emerge-execute-line)<br/>
<br/>
Run Emerge using files named in current text line.<br/>
Looks in that line for whitespace-separated entries of these forms:<br/>
	a=file1<br/>
	b=file2<br/>
	ancestor=file3<br/>
	output=file4<br/>
to specify the files to use in Emerge.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, if only one of `a=file' or `b=file' is present, and `output=file'<br/>
is present:<br/>
If `emerge-execute-line-deletions' is non-nil and `ancestor=file' is present,<br/>
it is assumed that the file in question has been deleted, and it is<br/>
not copied to the output file.<br/>
Otherwise, the A or B file present is copied to the output file.
