<strong>emerge-quit</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>emerge.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(emerge-quit <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Finish the Emerge session and exit Emerge.</br>
Prefix argument means to abort rather than successfully finish.</br>
The difference depends on how the merge was started,</br>
but usually means to not write over one of the original files, or to signal</br>
to some process which invoked Emerge a failure code.</br>
</br>
Unselects the selected difference, if any, restores the read-only and modified</br>
flags of the merged file buffers, restores the local keymap of the merge</br>
buffer, and sets off various emerge flags.  Using Emerge commands in this</br>
buffer after this will cause serious problems.
