</br>
</br>
(emerge-show-file-name)</br>
</br>
Displays the name of the file loaded into the current buffer.</br>
If the name won't fit on one line, the minibuffer is expanded to hold it,</br>
and the command waits for a keystroke from the user.  If the keystroke is</br>
SPC, it is ignored; if it is anything else, it is processed as a command.
