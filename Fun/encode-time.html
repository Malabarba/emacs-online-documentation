<strong>encode-time</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(encode-time <u>SECOND</u> <u>MINUTE</u> <u>HOUR</u> <u>DAY</u> <u>MONTH</u> <u>YEAR</u> &optional <u>ZONE</u>)</br>
</br>
Convert <u>SECOND</u>, <u>MINUTE</u>, <u>HOUR</u>, <u>DAY</u>, <u>MONTH</u>, <u>YEAR</u> and <u>ZONE</u> to internal time.</br>
This is the reverse operation of `decode-time', which see.</br>
<u>ZONE</u> defaults to the current time zone rule.  This can</br>
be a string or t (as from `set-time-zone-rule'), or it can be a list</br>
(as from `current-time-zone') or an integer (as from `decode-time')</br>
applied without consideration for daylight saving time.</br>
</br>
You can pass more than 7 arguments; then the first six arguments</br>
are used as <u>SECOND</u> through <u>YEAR</u>, and the *last* argument is used as <u>ZONE</u>.</br>
The intervening arguments are ignored.</br>
This feature lets (apply 'encode-time (decode-time ...)) work.</br>
</br>
Out-of-range values for <u>SECOND</u>, <u>MINUTE</u>, <u>HOUR</u>, <u>DAY</u>, or <u>MONTH</u> are allowed;</br>
for example, a <u>DAY</u> of 0 means the day preceding the given month.</br>
Year numbers less than 100 are treated just like other year numbers.</br>
If you want them to stand for years in this century, you must do that yourself.</br>
</br>
Years before 1970 are not guaranteed to work.  On some systems,</br>
year values as low as 1901 do work.
