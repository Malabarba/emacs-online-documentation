<strong>encode-time</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(encode-time SECOND MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR &optional ZONE)<br/>
<br/>
Convert SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, MONTH, YEAR and ZONE to internal time.<br/>
This is the reverse operation of `decode-time', which see.<br/>
ZONE defaults to the current time zone rule.  This can<br/>
be a string or t (as from `set-time-zone-rule'), or it can be a list<br/>
(as from `current-time-zone') or an integer (as from `decode-time')<br/>
applied without consideration for daylight saving time.<br/>
<br/>
You can pass more than 7 arguments; then the first six arguments<br/>
are used as SECOND through YEAR, and the *last* argument is used as ZONE.<br/>
The intervening arguments are ignored.<br/>
This feature lets (apply 'encode-time (decode-time ...)) work.<br/>
<br/>
Out-of-range values for SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, or MONTH are allowed;<br/>
for example, a DAY of 0 means the day preceding the given month.<br/>
Year numbers less than 100 are treated just like other year numbers.<br/>
If you want them to stand for years in this century, you must do that yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Years before 1970 are not guaranteed to work.  On some systems,<br/>
year values as low as 1901 do work.
