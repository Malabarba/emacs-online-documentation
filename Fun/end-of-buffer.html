end-of-buffer is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <C-end>, M->, <menu-bar> <edit> <goto> <end-of-buf>.<br/><br/>(end-of-buffer &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Move point to the end of the buffer.<br/>With numeric arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the end.<br/>If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the end of the<br/>accessible part of the buffer.<br/><br/>If Transient Mark mode is disabled, leave mark at previous<br/>position, unless a C-u prefix is supplied.<br/><br/>Don't use this command in Lisp programs!<br/>(goto-char (point-max)) is faster.
