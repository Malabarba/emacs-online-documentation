<strong>end-of-defun</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>lisp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;C-M-end>, C-M-e, ESC &lt;C-end>.</br>
</br>
<code>(end-of-defun <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Move forward to next end of defun.</br>
With argument, do it that many times.</br>
Negative argument -N means move back to Nth preceding end of defun.</br>
</br>
An end of a defun occurs right after the close-parenthesis that</br>
matches the open-parenthesis that starts a defun; see function</br>
`beginning-of-defun'.</br>
</br>
If variable `end-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value</br>
is called as a function to find the defun's end.
