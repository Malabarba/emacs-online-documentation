end-of-line is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(end-of-line &optional N)<br/><br/>Move point to end of current line (in the logical order).<br/>With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.<br/>If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.<br/>To ignore intangibility, bind `inhibit-point-motion-hooks' to t.<br/><br/>This function constrains point to the current field unless this moves<br/>point to a different line than the original, unconstrained result.  If<br/>N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends at point, the point does<br/>not move.  To ignore field boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion'<br/>to t.
