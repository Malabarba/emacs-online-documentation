<strong>epa-decrypt-region</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>epa.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <tools> <encryption-decryption> <decrypt-region>.<br/>
<br/>
(epa-decrypt-region START END &optional MAKE-BUFFER-FUNCTION)<br/>
<br/>
Decrypt the current region between START and END.<br/>
<br/>
If MAKE-BUFFER-FUNCTION is non-nil, call it to prepare an output buffer.<br/>
It should return that buffer.  If it copies the input, it should<br/>
delete the text now being decrypted.  It should leave point at the<br/>
proper place to insert the plaintext.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful about using this command in Lisp programs!<br/>
Since this function operates on regions, it does some tricks such<br/>
as coding-system detection and unibyte/multibyte conversion.  If<br/>
you are sure how the data in the region should be treated, you<br/>
should consider using the string based counterpart<br/>
`epg-decrypt-string', or the file based counterpart<br/>
`epg-decrypt-file' instead.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
(let ((context (epg-make-context 'OpenPGP)))<br/>
  (decode-coding-string<br/>
    (epg-decrypt-string context (buffer-substring start end))<br/>
    'utf-8))
