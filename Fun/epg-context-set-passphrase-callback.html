<strong>epg-context-set-passphrase-callback</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>epg.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(epg-context-set-passphrase-callback <u>CONTEXT</u> <u>PASSPHRASE-CALLBACK</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the function used to query passphrase.</br>
</br>
<u>PASSPHRASE-CALLBACK</u> is either a function, or a cons-cell whose</br>
car is a function and cdr is a callback data.</br>
</br>
The function gets three arguments: the context, the key-id in</br>
question, and the callback data (if any).</br>
</br>
The callback may not be called if you use GnuPG 2.x, which relies</br>
on the external program called `gpg-agent' for passphrase query.</br>
If you really want to intercept passphrase query, consider</br>
installing GnuPG 1.x _along with_ GnuPG 2.x, which does passphrase</br>
query by itself and Emacs can intercept them.
