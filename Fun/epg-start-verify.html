<strong>epg-start-verify</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>epg.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(epg-start-verify CONTEXT SIGNATURE &optional SIGNED-TEXT)<br/>
<br/>
Initiate a verify operation on SIGNATURE.<br/>
SIGNATURE and SIGNED-TEXT are a data object if they are specified.<br/>
<br/>
For a detached signature, both SIGNATURE and SIGNED-TEXT should be set.<br/>
For a normal or a cleartext signature, SIGNED-TEXT should be nil.<br/>
<br/>
If you use this function, you will need to wait for the completion of<br/>
`epg-gpg-program' by using `epg-wait-for-completion' and call<br/>
`epg-reset' to clear a temporary output file.<br/>
If you are unsure, use synchronous version of this function<br/>
`epg-verify-file' or `epg-verify-string' instead.
