<strong>epg-verify-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>epg.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(epg-verify-file CONTEXT SIGNATURE &optional SIGNED-TEXT PLAIN)<br/>
<br/>
Verify a file SIGNATURE.<br/>
SIGNED-TEXT and PLAIN are also a file if they are specified.<br/>
<br/>
For a detached signature, both SIGNATURE and SIGNED-TEXT should be<br/>
string.  For a normal or a cleartext signature, SIGNED-TEXT should be<br/>
nil.  In the latter case, if PLAIN is specified, the plaintext is<br/>
stored into the file after successful verification.
