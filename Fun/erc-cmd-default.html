<strong>erc-cmd-default</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>erc.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(erc-cmd-default <u>LINE</u>)</br>
</br>
Fallback command.</br>
</br>
Commands for which no erc-cmd-xxx exists, are tunneled through</br>
this function.  <u>LINE</u> is sent to the server verbatim, and</br>
therefore has to contain the command itself as well.
