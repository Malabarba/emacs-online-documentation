<strong>erc-log-irc-protocol</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>erc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(erc-log-irc-protocol STRING &optional OUTBOUND)<br/>
<br/>
Append STRING to the buffer *erc-protocol*.<br/>
<br/>
This only has any effect if `erc-debug-irc-protocol' is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
The buffer is created if it doesn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
If OUTBOUND is non-nil, STRING is being sent to the IRC server<br/>
and appears in face `erc-input-face' in the buffer.
