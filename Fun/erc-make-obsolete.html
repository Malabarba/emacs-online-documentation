<strong>erc-make-obsolete</strong> is an alias for `make-obsolete' in `<code>erc-compat.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(erc-make-obsolete OBSOLETE-NAME CURRENT-NAME &optional WHEN)<br/>
<br/>
Make the byte-compiler warn that function OBSOLETE-NAME is obsolete.<br/>
OBSOLETE-NAME should be a function name or macro name (a symbol).<br/>
<br/>
The warning will say that CURRENT-NAME should be used instead.<br/>
If CURRENT-NAME is a string, that is the `use instead' message<br/>
(it should end with a period, and not start with a capital).<br/>
WHEN should be a string indicating when the function<br/>
was first made obsolete, for example a date or a release number.
