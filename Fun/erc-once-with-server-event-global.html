<strong>erc-once-with-server-event-global</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>erc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(erc-once-with-server-event-global EVENT &rest FORMS)<br/>
<br/>
Execute FORMS the next time EVENT occurs in any server buffer.<br/>
<br/>
This function temporarily prepends a function to EVENT's hook to<br/>
execute FORMS.  After FORMS are run, the function is removed from<br/>
EVENT's hook.  The last expression of FORMS should be either nil<br/>
or t, where nil indicates that the other functions on EVENT's hook<br/>
should be run too, and t indicates that other functions should<br/>
not be run.<br/>
<br/>
When FORMS execute, the current buffer is the server buffer associated with the<br/>
connection over which the data was received that triggered EVENT.
