erc-once-with-server-event is a compiled Lisp function in `erc.el'.<br/><br/>(erc-once-with-server-event EVENT &rest FORMS)<br/><br/>Execute FORMS the next time EVENT occurs in the `current-buffer'.<br/><br/>You should make sure that `current-buffer' is a server buffer.<br/><br/>This function temporarily adds a function to EVENT's hook to<br/>execute FORMS.  After FORMS are run, the function is removed from<br/>EVENT's hook.  The last expression of FORMS should be either nil<br/>or t, where nil indicates that the other functions on EVENT's hook<br/>should be run too, and t indicates that other functions should<br/>not be run.<br/><br/>Please be sure to use this function in server-buffers.  In<br/>channel-buffers it may not work at all, as it uses the LOCAL<br/>argument of `add-hook' and `remove-hook' to ensure multiserver<br/>capabilities.
