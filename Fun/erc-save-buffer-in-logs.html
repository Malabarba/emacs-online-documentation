<strong>erc-save-buffer-in-logs</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>erc-log.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(erc-save-buffer-in-logs &optional BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Append BUFFER contents to the log file, if logging is enabled.<br/>
If BUFFER is not provided, current buffer is used.<br/>
Logging is enabled if `erc-logging-enabled' returns non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
This is normally done on exit, to save the unsaved portion of the<br/>
buffer, since only the text that runs off the buffer limit is logged<br/>
automatically.<br/>
<br/>
You can save every individual message by putting this function on<br/>
`erc-insert-post-hook'.
