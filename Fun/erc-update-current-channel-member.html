<strong>erc-update-current-channel-member</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>erc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(erc-update-current-channel-member NICK NEW-NICK &optional ADD OP VOICE HOST LOGIN FULL-NAME INFO UPDATE-MESSAGE-TIME)<br/>
<br/>
Updates the stored user information for the user with nickname<br/>
NICK.  `erc-update-user' is called to handle changes to nickname,<br/>
HOST, LOGIN, FULL-NAME, and INFO.  If OP or VOICE are non-nil,<br/>
they must be equal to either `on' or `off', in which case the<br/>
operator or voice status of the user in the current channel is<br/>
changed accordingly.  If UPDATE-MESSAGE-TIME is non-nil, the<br/>
last-message-time of the user in the current channel is set<br/>
to (current-time).<br/>
<br/>
If ADD is non-nil, the user will be added with the specified<br/>
information if it is not already present in the user or channel<br/>
lists.<br/>
<br/>
If, and only if, changes are made, or the user is added,<br/>
`erc-channel-members-updated-hook' is run, and t is returned.<br/>
