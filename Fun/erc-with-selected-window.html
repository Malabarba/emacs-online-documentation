(erc-with-selected-window <u>WINDOW</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute the forms in <u>BODY</u> with <u>WINDOW</u> as the selected window.</br>
The value returned is the value of the last form in <u>BODY</u>.</br>
</br>
This macro saves and restores the selected window, as well as the</br>
selected window of each frame.  It does not change the order of</br>
recently selected windows.  If the previously selected window of</br>
some frame is no longer live at the end of <u>BODY</u>, that frame's</br>
selected window is left alone.  If the selected window is no</br>
longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of <u>BODY</u></br>
remains selected.</br>
</br>
This macro uses `save-current-buffer' to save and restore the</br>
current buffer, since otherwise its normal operation could</br>
potentially make a different buffer current.  It does not alter</br>
the buffer list ordering.
