<strong>ert--expand-should</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ert.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ert--expand-should <u>WHOLE</u> <u>FORM</u> <u>INNER-EXPANDER</u>)</br>
</br>
Helper function for the `should' macro and its variants.</br>
</br>
Analyzes <u>FORM</u> and returns an expression that has the same</br>
semantics under evaluation but records additional debugging</br>
information.</br>
</br>
<u>INNER-EXPANDER</u> should be a function and is called with two</br>
arguments: INNER-FORM and FORM-DESCRIPTION-FORM, where INNER-FORM</br>
is an expression equivalent to <u>FORM</u>, and FORM-DESCRIPTION-FORM is</br>
an expression that returns a description of <u>FORM</u>.  <u>INNER-EXPANDER</u></br>
should return code that calls INNER-FORM and performs the checks</br>
and error signaling specific to the particular variant of</br>
`should'.  The code that <u>INNER-EXPANDER</u> returns must not call</br>
FORM-DESCRIPTION-FORM before it has called INNER-FORM.
