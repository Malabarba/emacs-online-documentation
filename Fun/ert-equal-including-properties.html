<strong>ert-equal-including-properties</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ert.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ert-equal-including-properties A B)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if A and B have similar structure and contents.<br/>
<br/>
This is like `equal-including-properties' except that it compares<br/>
the property values of text properties structurally (by<br/>
recursing) rather than with `eq'.  Perhaps this is what<br/>
`equal-including-properties' should do in the first place; see<br/>
