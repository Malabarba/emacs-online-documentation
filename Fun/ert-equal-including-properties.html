<strong>ert-equal-including-properties</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ert.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ert-equal-including-properties <u>A</u> <u>B</u>)</br>
</br>
Return t if <u>A</u> and <u>B</u> have similar structure and contents.</br>
</br>
This is like `equal-including-properties' except that it compares</br>
the property values of text properties structurally (by</br>
recursing) rather than with `eq'.  Perhaps this is what</br>
`equal-including-properties' should do in the first place; see</br>
Emacs bug 6581 at URL `http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=6581'.
