<strong>ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ert.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit &optional <u>SELECTOR</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `ert-run-tests-batch', but exits Emacs when done.</br>
</br>
The exit status will be 0 if all test results were as expected, 1</br>
on unexpected results, or 2 if the tool detected an error outside</br>
of the tests (e.g. invalid <u>SELECTOR</u> or bug in the code that runs</br>
the tests).
