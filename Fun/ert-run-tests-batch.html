<strong>ert-run-tests-batch</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ert.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ert-run-tests-batch &optional SELECTOR)<br/>
<br/>
Run the tests specified by SELECTOR, printing results to the terminal.<br/>
<br/>
SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests', except if<br/>
SELECTOR is nil, in which case all tests rather than none will be<br/>
run; this makes the command line "emacs -batch -l my-tests.el -f<br/>
ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit" useful.<br/>
<br/>
Returns the stats object.
