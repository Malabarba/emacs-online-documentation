ert-run-tests-batch is an autoloaded Lisp function in `ert.el'.<br/><br/>(ert-run-tests-batch &optional SELECTOR)<br/><br/>Run the tests specified by SELECTOR, printing results to the terminal.<br/><br/>SELECTOR works as described in `ert-select-tests', except if<br/>SELECTOR is nil, in which case all tests rather than none will be<br/>run; this makes the command line "emacs -batch -l my-tests.el -f<br/>ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit" useful.<br/><br/>Returns the stats object.
