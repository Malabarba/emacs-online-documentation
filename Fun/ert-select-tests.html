<strong>ert-select-tests</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ert.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ert-select-tests SELECTOR UNIVERSE)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of tests that match SELECTOR.<br/>
<br/>
UNIVERSE specifies the set of tests to select from; it should be a list<br/>
of tests, or t, which refers to all tests named by symbols in `obarray'.<br/>
<br/>
Valid SELECTORs:<br/>
<br/>
nil  -- Selects the empty set.<br/>
t    -- Selects UNIVERSE.<br/>
:new -- Selects all tests that have not been run yet.<br/>
:failed, :passed       -- Select tests according to their most recent result.<br/>
:expected, :unexpected -- Select tests according to their most recent result.<br/>
a string -- A regular expression selecting all tests with matching names.<br/>
a test   -- (i.e., an object of the ert-test data-type) Selects that test.<br/>
a symbol -- Selects the test that the symbol names, errors if none.<br/>
(member TESTS...) -- Selects the elements of TESTS, a list of tests<br/>
    or symbols naming tests.<br/>
(eql TEST) -- Selects TEST, a test or a symbol naming a test.<br/>
(and SELECTORS...) -- Selects the tests that match all SELECTORS.<br/>
(or SELECTORS...)  -- Selects the tests that match any of the SELECTORS.<br/>
(not SELECTOR)     -- Selects all tests that do not match SELECTOR.<br/>
(tag TAG) -- Selects all tests that have TAG on their tags list.<br/>
    A tag is an arbitrary label you can apply when you define a test.<br/>
(satisfies PREDICATE) -- Selects all tests that satisfy PREDICATE.<br/>
    PREDICATE is a function that takes an ert-test object as argument,<br/>
    and returns non-nil if it is selected.<br/>
<br/>
Only selectors that require a superset of tests, such<br/>
as (satisfies ...), strings, :new, etc. make use of UNIVERSE.<br/>
Selectors that do not, such as (member ...), just return the<br/>
set implied by them without checking whether it is really<br/>
contained in UNIVERSE.
