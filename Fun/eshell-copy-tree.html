<strong>eshell-copy-tree</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/copy-tree.html">copy-tree</a></strong>' in `<code>esh-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eshell-copy-tree <u>TREE</u> &optional <u>VECP</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a copy of <u>TREE</u>.</br>
If <u>TREE</u> is a cons cell, this recursively copies both its car and its cdr.</br>
Contrast to `copy-sequence', which copies only along the cdrs.  With second</br>
argument <u>VECP</u>, this copies vectors as well as conses.
