<strong>eshell-find-delimiter</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eshell-find-delimiter OPEN CLOSE &optional BOUND REVERSE-P BACKSLASH-P)<br/>
<br/>
From point, find the CLOSE delimiter corresponding to OPEN.<br/>
The matching is bounded by BOUND.<br/>
If REVERSE-P is non-nil, process the region backwards.<br/>
If BACKSLASH-P is non-nil, and OPEN and CLOSE are the same character,<br/>
then quoting is done by a backslash, rather than a doubled delimiter.
