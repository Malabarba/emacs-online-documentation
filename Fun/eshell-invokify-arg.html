<strong>eshell-invokify-arg</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eshell-invokify-arg ARG &optional SHARE-OUTPUT SILENT)<br/>
<br/>
Change ARG so it can be invoked from a structured command.<br/>
<br/>
SHARE-OUTPUT, if non-nil, means this invocation should share the<br/>
current output stream, which is separately redirectable.  SILENT<br/>
means the user and/or any redirections shouldn't see any output<br/>
from this command.  If both SHARE-OUTPUT and SILENT are non-nil,<br/>
the second is ignored.
