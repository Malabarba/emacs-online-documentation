<strong>eshell-remote-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-ext.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eshell-remote-command <u>COMMAND</u> <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert output from a remote <u>COMMAND</u>, using <u>ARGS</u>.</br>
A remote command is something that executes on a different machine.</br>
An external command simply means external to Emacs.</br>
</br>
Note that this function is very crude at the moment.  It gathers up</br>
all the output from the remote command, and sends it all at once,</br>
causing the user to wonder if anything's really going on...
