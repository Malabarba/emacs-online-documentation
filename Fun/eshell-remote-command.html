<strong>eshell-remote-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-ext.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eshell-remote-command COMMAND ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Insert output from a remote COMMAND, using ARGS.<br/>
A remote command is something that executes on a different machine.<br/>
An external command simply means external to Emacs.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this function is very crude at the moment.  It gathers up<br/>
all the output from the remote command, and sends it all at once,<br/>
causing the user to wonder if anything's really going on...
