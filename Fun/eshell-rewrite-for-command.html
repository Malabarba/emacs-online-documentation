<strong>eshell-rewrite-for-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eshell-rewrite-for-command <u>TERMS</u>)</br>
</br>
Rewrite a `for' command into its equivalent Eshell command form.</br>
Because the implementation of `for' relies upon conditional evaluation</br>
of its argument (i.e., use of a Lisp special form), it must be</br>
implemented via rewriting, rather than as a function.
