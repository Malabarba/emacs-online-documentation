<strong>eshell-rewrite-if-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eshell-rewrite-if-command TERMS)<br/>
<br/>
Rewrite an `if' command into its equivalent Eshell command form.<br/>
Because the implementation of `if' relies upon conditional<br/>
evaluation of its argument (i.e., use of a Lisp special form), it<br/>
must be implemented via rewriting, rather than as a function.
