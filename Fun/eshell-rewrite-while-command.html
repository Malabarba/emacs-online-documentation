<strong>eshell-rewrite-while-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eshell-rewrite-while-command <u>TERMS</u>)</br>
</br>
Rewrite a `while' command into its equivalent Eshell command form.</br>
Because the implementation of `while' relies upon conditional</br>
evaluation of its argument (i.e., use of a Lisp special form), it</br>
must be implemented via rewriting, rather than as a function.
