<strong>eshell-send-input</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(eshell-send-input &optional <u>USE-REGION</u> <u>QUEUE-P</u> <u>NO-NEWLINE</u>)</br>
</br>
Send the input received to Eshell for parsing and processing.</br>
After `eshell-last-output-end', sends all text from that marker to</br>
point as input.  Before that marker, calls `eshell-get-old-input' to</br>
retrieve old input, copies it to the end of the buffer, and sends it.</br>
</br>
If <u>USE-REGION</u> is non-nil, the current region (between point and mark)</br>
will be used as input.</br>
</br>
If <u>QUEUE-P</u> is non-nil, input will be queued until the next prompt,</br>
rather than sent to the currently active process.  If no process, the</br>
input is processed immediately.</br>
</br>
If <u>NO-NEWLINE</u> is non-nil, the input is sent without an implied final</br>
newline.
