eshell-send-input is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `esh-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(eshell-send-input &optional USE-REGION QUEUE-P NO-NEWLINE)<br/><br/>Send the input received to Eshell for parsing and processing.<br/>After `eshell-last-output-end', sends all text from that marker to<br/>point as input.  Before that marker, calls `eshell-get-old-input' to<br/>retrieve old input, copies it to the end of the buffer, and sends it.<br/><br/>If USE-REGION is non-nil, the current region (between point and mark)<br/>will be used as input.<br/><br/>If QUEUE-P is non-nil, input will be queued until the next prompt,<br/>rather than sent to the currently active process.  If no process, the<br/>input is processed immediately.<br/><br/>If NO-NEWLINE is non-nil, the input is sent without an implied final<br/>newline.
