<strong>eshell-structure-basic-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eshell-structure-basic-command FUNC NAMES KEYWORD TEST BODY &optional ELSE VOCAL-TEST)<br/>
<br/>
With TERMS, KEYWORD, and two NAMES, structure a basic command.<br/>
The first of NAMES should be the positive form, and the second the<br/>
negative.  It's not likely that users should ever need to call this<br/>
function.<br/>
<br/>
If VOCAL-TEST is non-nil, it means output from the test should be<br/>
shown, as well as output from the body.
