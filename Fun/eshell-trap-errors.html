<strong>eshell-trap-errors</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eshell-trap-errors <u>OBJECT</u>)</br>
</br>
Trap any errors that occur, so they are not entirely fatal.</br>
Also, the variable `eshell-this-command-hook' is available for the</br>
duration of <u>OBJECT</u>'s evaluation.  Note that functions should be added</br>
to this hook using `nconc', and *not* `add-hook'.</br>
</br>
Someday, when Scheme will become the dominant Emacs language, all of</br>
this grossness will be made to disappear by using `call/cc'...
