<strong>eshell-unload-all-modules</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>eshell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eshell-unload-all-modules)<br/>
<br/>
Unload all modules that were loaded by Eshell, if possible.<br/>
If the user has require'd in any of the modules, or customized a<br/>

will be impossible to unload Eshell completely without restarting<br/>
Emacs.
