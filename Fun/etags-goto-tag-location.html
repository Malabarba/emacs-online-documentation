<strong>etags-goto-tag-location</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>etags.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(etags-goto-tag-location TAG-INFO)<br/>
<br/>
Go to location of tag specified by TAG-INFO.<br/>
TAG-INFO is a cons (TEXT LINE . POSITION).<br/>
TEXT is the initial part of a line containing the tag.<br/>
LINE is the line number.<br/>
POSITION is the (one-based) char position of TEXT within the file.<br/>
<br/>
If TEXT is t, it means the tag refers to exactly LINE or POSITION,<br/>
whichever is present, LINE having preference, no searching.<br/>
Either LINE or POSITION can be nil.  POSITION is used if present.<br/>
<br/>
If the tag isn't exactly at the given position, then look near that<br/>
position using a search window that expands progressively until it<br/>
hits the start of file.
