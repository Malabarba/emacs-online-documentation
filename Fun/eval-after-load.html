<strong>eval-after-load</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(eval-after-load FILE FORM)<br/>
<br/>
Arrange that if FILE is loaded, FORM will be run immediately afterwards.<br/>
If FILE is already loaded, evaluate FORM right now.<br/>
<br/>
If a matching file is loaded again, FORM will be evaluated again.<br/>
<br/>
If FILE is a string, it may be either an absolute or a relative file<br/>
name, and may have an extension (e.g. ".el") or may lack one, and<br/>
additionally may or may not have an extension denoting a compressed<br/>
format (e.g. ".gz").<br/>
<br/>
When FILE is absolute, this first converts it to a true name by chasing<br/>
symbolic links.  Only a file of this name (see next paragraph regarding<br/>
extensions) will trigger the evaluation of FORM.  When FILE is relative,<br/>
a file whose absolute true name ends in FILE will trigger evaluation.<br/>
<br/>
When FILE lacks an extension, a file name with any extension will trigger<br/>
evaluation.  Otherwise, its extension must match FILE's.  A further<br/>
extension for a compressed format (e.g. ".gz") on FILE will not affect<br/>
this name matching.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, FILE can be a feature (i.e. a symbol), in which case FORM<br/>
is evaluated at the end of any file that `provide's this feature.<br/>
If the feature is provided when evaluating code not associated with a<br/>
file, FORM is evaluated immediately after the provide statement.<br/>
<br/>
Usually FILE is just a library name like "font-lock" or a feature name<br/>
like 'font-lock.<br/>
<br/>
This function makes or adds to an entry on `after-load-alist'.
