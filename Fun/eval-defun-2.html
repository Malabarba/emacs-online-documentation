</br>
(eval-defun-2)</br>
</br>
Evaluate defun that point is in or before.</br>
The value is displayed in the echo area.</br>
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar',</br>
then reset the variable using the initial value expression</br>
even if the variable already has some other value.</br>

if it already has a value.)</br>
