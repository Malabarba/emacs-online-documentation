<strong>eval-when-compile</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>byte-run.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(eval-when-compile &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `progn', but evaluates the body at compile time if you're compiling.</br>
Thus, the result of the body appears to the compiler as a quoted</br>
constant.  In interpreted code, this is entirely equivalent to</br>
`progn', except that the value of the expression may be (but is</br>
not necessarily) computed at load time if eager macro expansion</br>
is enabled.
