<strong>ewoc-collect</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ewoc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ewoc-collect EWOC PREDICATE &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Select elements from EWOC using PREDICATE.<br/>
Return a list of all selected data elements.<br/>
PREDICATE is a function that takes a data element as its first<br/>
argument.  The elements on the returned list will appear in the<br/>
same order as in the buffer.  You should not rely on the order of<br/>
calls to PREDICATE.<br/>
Note that the buffer the EWOC is displayed in is the current<br/>
buffer when PREDICATE is called.  PREDICATE must restore it if it<br/>
changes it.<br/>
If more than two arguments are given the<br/>
remaining arguments will be passed to PREDICATE.
