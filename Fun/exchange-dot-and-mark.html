<strong>exchange-dot-and-mark</strong> is an alias for `exchange-point-and-mark' in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(exchange-dot-and-mark &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 23.3;<br/>
use `exchange-point-and-mark' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.<br/>
This command works even when the mark is not active,<br/>
and it reactivates the mark.<br/>
<br/>
If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix ARG deactivates the mark<br/>
if it is active, and otherwise avoids reactivating it.  If<br/>
Transient Mark mode is off, a prefix ARG enables Transient Mark<br/>
mode temporarily.
