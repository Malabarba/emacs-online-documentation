<strong>exchange-dot-and-mark</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="exchange-point-and-mark.html">exchange-point-and-mark</a></strong>' in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(exchange-dot-and-mark &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 23.3;</br>
use `exchange-point-and-mark' instead.</br>
</br>
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.</br>
This command works even when the mark is not active,</br>
and it reactivates the mark.</br>
</br>
If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix <u>ARG</u> deactivates the mark</br>
if it is active, and otherwise avoids reactivating it.  If</br>
Transient Mark mode is off, a prefix <u>ARG</u> enables Transient Mark</br>
mode temporarily.
