<strong>exchange-point-and-mark</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x C-x.</br>
</br>
<code>(exchange-point-and-mark <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.</br>
This command works even when the mark is not active,</br>
and it reactivates the mark.</br>
</br>
If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix <u>ARG</u> deactivates the mark</br>
if it is active, and otherwise avoids reactivating it.  If</br>
Transient Mark mode is off, a prefix <u>ARG</u> enables Transient Mark</br>
mode temporarily.
