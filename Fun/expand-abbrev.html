<strong>expand-abbrev</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>abbrev.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x ', C-x a ', C-x a e.</br>
</br>
<code>(expand-abbrev</code>)</br>
</br>
Expand the abbrev before point, if there is an abbrev there.</br>
Effective when explicitly called even when `abbrev-mode' is nil.</br>
Before doing anything else, runs `pre-abbrev-expand-hook'.</br>
Calls `abbrev-expand-function' with no argument to do the work,</br>
and returns whatever it does.  (This should be the abbrev symbol</br>
if expansion occurred, else nil.)
