<strong>expand-file-name</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(expand-file-name <u>NAME</u> &optional <u>DEFAULT-DIRECTORY</u>)</br>
</br>
Convert filename <u>NAME</u> to absolute, and canonicalize it.</br>
Second arg <u>DEFAULT-DIRECTORY</u> is directory to start with if <u>NAME</u> is relative</br>
(does not start with slash or tilde); both the directory name and</br>
a directory's file name are accepted.  If <u>DEFAULT-DIRECTORY</u> is nil or</br>
missing, the current buffer's value of `default-directory' is used.</br>
<u>NAME</u> should be a string that is a valid file name for the underlying</br>
filesystem.</br>
File name components that are `.' are removed, and</br>
so are file name components followed by `..', along with the `..' itself;</br>
note that these simplifications are done without checking the resulting</br>
file names in the file system.</br>
Multiple consecutive slashes are collapsed into a single slash,</br>
except at the beginning of the file name when they are significant (e.g.,</br>
UNC file names on MS-Windows.)</br>
An initial `~/' expands to your home directory.</br>
An initial `~USER/' expands to USER's home directory.</br>
See also the function `substitute-in-file-name'.</br>
</br>
For technical reasons, this function can return correct but</br>
non-intuitive results for the root directory; for instance,</br>
(expand-file-name ".." "/") returns "/..".  For this reason, use</br>
(directory-file-name (file-name-directory dirname)) to traverse a</br>
filesystem tree, not (expand-file-name ".."  dirname).
