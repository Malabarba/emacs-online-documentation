<strong>face-attribute-relative-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(face-attribute-relative-p <u>ATTRIBUTE</u> <u>VALUE</u>)</br>
</br>
Check whether a face attribute value is relative.</br>
Specifically, this function returns t if the attribute <u>ATTRIBUTE</u></br>
with the value <u>VALUE</u> is relative.</br>

A relative value is one that doesn't entirely override whatever is</br>
inherited from another face.  For most possible attributes,</br>
the only relative value that users see is `unspecified'.</br>
However, for :height, floating point values are also relative.
