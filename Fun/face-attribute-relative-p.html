<strong>face-attribute-relative-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(face-attribute-relative-p ATTRIBUTE VALUE)<br/>
<br/>
Check whether a face attribute value is relative.<br/>
Specifically, this function returns t if the attribute ATTRIBUTE<br/>
with the value VALUE is relative.<br/>

A relative value is one that doesn't entirely override whatever is<br/>
inherited from another face.  For most possible attributes,<br/>
the only relative value that users see is `unspecified'.<br/>
However, for :height, floating point values are also relative.
