face-attribute is a compiled Lisp function in `faces.el'.<br/><br/>(face-attribute FACE ATTRIBUTE &optional FRAME INHERIT)<br/><br/>Return the value of FACE's ATTRIBUTE on FRAME.<br/>If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.<br/>If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).<br/>If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.<br/><br/>If INHERIT is nil, only attributes directly defined by FACE are considered,<br/>  so the return value may be `unspecified', or a relative value.<br/>If INHERIT is non-nil, FACE's definition of ATTRIBUTE is merged with the<br/>  faces specified by its `:inherit' attribute; however the return value<br/>  may still be `unspecified' or relative.<br/>If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then the result is further merged<br/>  with that face (or faces), until it becomes specified and absolute.<br/><br/>To ensure that the return value is always specified and absolute, use a<br/>value of `default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified or<br/>relative values by merging with the `default' face (which is always<br/>completely specified).
