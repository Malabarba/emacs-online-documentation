face-background-pixmap is an alias for `face-stipple' in `faces.el'.<br/><br/>(face-background-pixmap FACE &optional FRAME INHERIT)<br/><br/>Return the stipple pixmap name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.<br/>If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.<br/>If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).<br/>If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.<br/><br/>If INHERIT is nil, only a stipple directly defined by FACE is<br/>  considered, so the return value may be nil.<br/>If INHERIT is t, and FACE doesn't define a stipple, then any stipple<br/>  that FACE inherits through its `:inherit' attribute is considered as<br/>  well; however the return value may still be nil.<br/>If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then it is used to try to<br/>  resolve an unspecified stipple.<br/><br/>To ensure that a valid stipple or nil is always returned, use a value of<br/>`default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified values by merging<br/>with the `default' face (which is always completely specified).
