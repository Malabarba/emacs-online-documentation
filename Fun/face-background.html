face-background is a compiled Lisp function in `faces.el'.<br/><br/>(face-background FACE &optional FRAME INHERIT)<br/><br/>Return the background color name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.<br/>If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.<br/>If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).<br/>If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.<br/><br/>If INHERIT is nil, only a background color directly defined by FACE is<br/>  considered, so the return value may be nil.<br/>If INHERIT is t, and FACE doesn't define a background color, then any<br/>  background color that FACE inherits through its `:inherit' attribute<br/>  is considered as well; however the return value may still be nil.<br/>If INHERIT is a face or a list of faces, then it is used to try to<br/>  resolve an unspecified background color.<br/><br/>To ensure that a valid color is always returned, use a value of<br/>`default' for INHERIT; this will resolve any unspecified values by<br/>merging with the `default' face (which is always completely specified).
