face-remap-add-relative is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `face-remap.el'.<br/><br/>(face-remap-add-relative FACE &rest SPECS)<br/><br/>Add a face remapping entry of FACE to SPECS in the current buffer.<br/>Return a cookie which can be used to delete this remapping with<br/>`face-remap-remove-relative'.<br/><br/>The remaining arguments, SPECS, should form a list of faces.<br/>Each list element should be either a face name or a property list<br/>of face attribute/value pairs.  If more than one face is listed,<br/>that specifies an aggregate face, in the same way as in a `face'<br/>text property, except for possible priority changes noted below.<br/><br/>The face remapping specified by SPECS takes effect alongside the<br/>remappings from other calls to `face-remap-add-relative' for the<br/>same FACE, as well as the normal definition of FACE (at lowest<br/>priority).  This function tries to sort multiple remappings for<br/>the same face, so that remappings specifying relative face<br/>attributes are applied after remappings specifying absolute face<br/>attributes.<br/><br/>The base (lowest priority) remapping may be set to something<br/>other than the normal definition of FACE via `face-remap-set-base'.
