<strong>face-remap-add-relative</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>face-remap.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(face-remap-add-relative <u>FACE</u> &rest <u>SPECS</u>)</br>
</br>
Add a face remapping entry of <u>FACE</u> to <u>SPECS</u> in the current buffer.</br>
Return a cookie which can be used to delete this remapping with</br>
`face-remap-remove-relative'.</br>
</br>
The remaining arguments, <u>SPECS</u>, should form a list of faces.</br>
Each list element should be either a face name or a property list</br>
of face attribute/value pairs.  If more than one face is listed,</br>
that specifies an aggregate face, in the same way as in a `face'</br>
text property, except for possible priority changes noted below.</br>
</br>
The face remapping specified by <u>SPECS</u> takes effect alongside the</br>
remappings from other calls to `face-remap-add-relative' for the</br>
same <u>FACE</u>, as well as the normal definition of <u>FACE</u> (at lowest</br>
priority).  This function tries to sort multiple remappings for</br>
the same face, so that remappings specifying relative face</br>
attributes are applied after remappings specifying absolute face</br>
attributes.</br>
</br>
The base (lowest priority) remapping may be set to something</br>
other than the normal definition of <u>FACE</u> via `face-remap-set-base'.
