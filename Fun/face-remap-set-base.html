face-remap-set-base is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `face-remap.el'.<br/><br/>(face-remap-set-base FACE &rest SPECS)<br/><br/>Set the base remapping of FACE in the current buffer to SPECS.<br/>This causes the remappings specified by `face-remap-add-relative'<br/>to apply on top of the face specification given by SPECS.<br/><br/>The remaining arguments, SPECS, should form a list of faces.<br/>Each list element should be either a face name or a property list<br/>of face attribute/value pairs, like in a `face' text property.<br/><br/>If SPECS is empty, call `face-remap-reset-base' to use the normal<br/>definition of FACE as the base remapping; note that this is<br/>different from SPECS containing a single value `nil', which means<br/>not to inherit from the global definition of FACE at all.
