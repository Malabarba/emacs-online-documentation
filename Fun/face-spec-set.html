<strong>face-spec-set</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>faces.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(face-spec-set <u>FACE</u> <u>SPEC</u> &optional <u>SPEC-TYPE</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the face spec <u>SPEC</u> for <u>FACE</u>.</br>
See `defface' for the format of <u>SPEC</u>.</br>
</br>
The appearance of each face is controlled by its specs (set via</br>
this function), and by the internal frame-specific face</br>
attributes (set via `set-face-attribute').</br>
</br>
This function also defines <u>FACE</u> as a valid face name if it is not</br>
already one, and (re)calculates its attributes on existing</br>
frames.</br>
</br>
The argument <u>SPEC-TYPE</u> determines which spec to set:</br>
  nil or `face-override-spec' means the override spec (which is</br>
    usually what you want if calling this function outside of</br>
    Custom code);</br>
  `customized-face' or `saved-face' means the customized spec or</br>
    the saved custom spec;</br>
  `face-defface-spec' means the default spec</br>
    (usually set only via `defface');</br>
  `reset' means to ignore <u>SPEC</u>, but clear the `customized-face'</br>
    and `face-override-spec' specs;</br>
Any other value means not to set any spec, but to run the</br>
function for its other effects.
