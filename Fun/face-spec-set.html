face-spec-set is a compiled Lisp function in `faces.el'.<br/><br/>(face-spec-set FACE SPEC &optional FOR-DEFFACE)<br/><br/>Set and apply the face spec for FACE.<br/>If the optional argument FOR-DEFFACE is omitted or nil, set the<br/>overriding spec to SPEC, recording it in the `face-override-spec'<br/>property of FACE.  See `defface' for the format of SPEC.<br/><br/>If FOR-DEFFACE is non-nil, set the base spec (the one set by<br/>`defface' and Custom).  In this case, SPEC is ignored; the caller<br/>is responsible for putting the face spec in the `saved-face',<br/>`customized-face', or `face-defface-spec', as appropriate.<br/><br/>The appearance of FACE is controlled by the base spec, by any<br/>custom theme specs on top of that, and by the overriding spec on<br/>top of all the rest.
