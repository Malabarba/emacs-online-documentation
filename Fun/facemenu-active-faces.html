facemenu-active-faces is a compiled Lisp function in `facemenu.el'.<br/><br/>(facemenu-active-faces FACE-LIST &optional FRAME)<br/><br/>Return from FACE-LIST those faces that would be used for display.<br/>This means each face attribute is not specified in a face earlier in FACE-LIST<br/>and such a face is therefore active when used to display text.<br/>If the optional argument FRAME is given, use the faces in that frame; otherwise<br/>use the selected frame.  If t, then the global, non-frame faces are used.
