<strong>facemenu-add-face</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>facemenu.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(facemenu-add-face FACE &optional START END)<br/>
<br/>
Add FACE to text between START and END.<br/>
If START is nil or START to END is empty, add FACE to next typed character<br/>
instead.  For each section of that region that has a different face property,<br/>
FACE will be consed onto it, and other faces that are completely hidden by<br/>
that will be removed from the list.<br/>
If `facemenu-add-face-function' and maybe `facemenu-end-add-face' are non-nil,<br/>
they are used to set the face information.<br/>
<br/>
As a special case, if FACE is `default', then the region is left with NO face<br/>
text property.  Otherwise, selecting the default face would not have any<br/>
effect.  See `facemenu-remove-face-function'.
