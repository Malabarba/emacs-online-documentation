<strong>facemenu-add-face</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>facemenu.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(facemenu-add-face <u>FACE</u> &optional <u>START</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Add <u>FACE</u> to text between <u>START</u> and <u>END</u>.</br>
If <u>START</u> is nil or <u>START</u> to <u>END</u> is empty, add <u>FACE</u> to next typed character</br>
instead.  For each section of that region that has a different face property,</br>
<u>FACE</u> will be consed onto it, and other faces that are completely hidden by</br>
that will be removed from the list.</br>
If `facemenu-add-face-function' and maybe `facemenu-end-add-face' are non-nil,</br>
they are used to set the face information.</br>
</br>
As a special case, if <u>FACE</u> is `default', then the region is left with NO face</br>
text property.  Otherwise, selecting the default face would not have any</br>
effect.  See `facemenu-remove-face-function'.
