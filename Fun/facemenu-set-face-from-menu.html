If FACE is a symbol whose<br/>name starts with "fg:" or "bg:", then this functions sets the<br/>foreground or background to the color specified by the rest of the<br/>symbol's name.  Any other symbol is considered the name of a face.<br/><br/>If the region is active (normally true except in Transient Mark mode)<br/>and there is no prefix argument, this command sets the region to the<br/>requested face.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character<br/>inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before typing a character<br/>to insert cancels the specification.
