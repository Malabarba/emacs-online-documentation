facemenu-set-face is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `facemenu.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to M-o o, <C-down-mouse-2> <fc> o, <menu-bar> <edit> <props> <fc> o.<br/><br/>(facemenu-set-face FACE &optional START END)<br/><br/>Apply FACE to the region or next character typed.<br/><br/>If the region is active (normally true except in Transient<br/>Mark mode) and nonempty, and there is no prefix argument,<br/>this command applies FACE to the region.  Otherwise, it applies FACE<br/>to the faces to use for the next character<br/>inserted.  (Moving point or switching buffers before typing<br/>a character to insert cancels the specification.)<br/><br/>If FACE is `default', to "apply" it means clearing<br/>the list of faces to be used.  For any other value of FACE,<br/>to "apply" it means putting FACE at the front of the list<br/>of faces to be used, and removing any faces further<br/>along in the list that would be completely overridden by<br/>preceding faces (including FACE).<br/><br/>This command can also add FACE to the menu of faces,<br/>if `facemenu-listed-faces' says to do that.
