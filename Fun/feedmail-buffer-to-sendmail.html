</br>
(feedmail-buffer-to-sendmail <u>PREPPED</u> <u>ERRORS-TO</u> <u>ADDR-LISTOID</u>)</br>
</br>
Function which actually calls sendmail as a subprocess.</br>
Feeds the buffer to it.  Probably has some flaws for Resent-* and other</br>
complicated cases.  Takes addresses from message headers and</br>
might disappoint you with BCC: handling.  In case of odd results, consult</br>
local gurus.
