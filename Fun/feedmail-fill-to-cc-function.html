(feedmail-fill-to-cc-function HEADER-END)<br/>
<br/>
Smart filling of address headers (don't be fooled by the name).<br/>
The filling tries to avoid splitting lines except at commas.  This<br/>
avoids, in particular, splitting within parenthesized comments in<br/>
addresses.  Headers filled include From:, Reply-To:, To:, Cc:, Bcc:,<br/>
Resent-To:, Resent-Cc:, and Resent-Bcc:.
