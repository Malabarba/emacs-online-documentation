feedmail-mail-send-hook-splitter is a compiled Lisp function in `feedmail.el'.<br/><br/>(feedmail-mail-send-hook-splitter)<br/><br/>Facilitate dividing `mail-send-hook' things into queued and immediate cases.<br/>If you have `mail-send-hook' functions that should only be called for sending/<br/>queueing messages or only be called for the sending of queued messages, this is<br/>for you.  Add this function to `mail-send-hook' with something like this:<br/><br/>	(add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'feedmail-mail-send-hook-splitter)<br/><br/>Then add the functions you want called to either `feedmail-mail-send-hook-queued'<br/>or `feedmail-mail-send-hook', as appropriate.  The distinction is that<br/>`feedmail-mail-send-hook' will be called when you send mail from a composition<br/>buffer (typically by typing C-c C-c), whether the message is sent immediately<br/>or placed in the queue or drafts directory.  `feedmail-mail-send-hook-queued' is<br/>called when messages are being sent from the queue directory, typically via a<br/>call to `feedmail-run-the-queue'.
