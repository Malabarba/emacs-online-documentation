</br>
</br>
(feedmail-queue-reminder &optional <u>WHAT-EVENT</u>)</br>
</br>
Perform some kind of reminder activity about queued and draft messages.</br>
Called with an optional symbol argument which says what kind of event</br>
is triggering the reminder activity.  The default is 'on-demand, which</br>
is what you typically would use if you were putting this in your Emacs start-up</br>
or mail hook code.  Other recognized values for <u>WHAT-EVENT</u> (these are passed</br>
internally by feedmail):</br>
</br>
   after-immediate      (a message has just been sent in immediate mode)</br>
   after-queue          (a message has just been queued)</br>
   after-draft          (a message has just been placed in the draft directory)</br>
   after-run            (the queue has just been run, possibly sending messages)</br>
</br>
<u>WHAT-EVENT</u> is used as a key into the table `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist'.  If</br>
the associated value is a function, it is called without arguments and is expected</br>
to perform the reminder activity.  You can supply your own reminder functions</br>
by redefining `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist'.  If you don't want any reminders,</br>
you can set `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist' to nil.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
