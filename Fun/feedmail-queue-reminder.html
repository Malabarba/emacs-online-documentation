feedmail-queue-reminder is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `feedmail.el'.<br/><br/>(feedmail-queue-reminder &optional WHAT-EVENT)<br/><br/>Perform some kind of reminder activity about queued and draft messages.<br/>Called with an optional symbol argument which says what kind of event<br/>is triggering the reminder activity.  The default is 'on-demand, which<br/>is what you typically would use if you were putting this in your Emacs start-up<br/>or mail hook code.  Other recognized values for WHAT-EVENT (these are passed<br/>internally by feedmail):<br/><br/>   after-immediate      (a message has just been sent in immediate mode)<br/>   after-queue          (a message has just been queued)<br/>   after-draft          (a message has just been placed in the draft directory)<br/>   after-run            (the queue has just been run, possibly sending messages)<br/><br/>WHAT-EVENT is used as a key into the table `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist'.  If<br/>the associated value is a function, it is called without arguments and is expected<br/>to perform the reminder activity.  You can supply your own reminder functions<br/>by redefining `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist'.  If you don't want any reminders,<br/>you can set `feedmail-queue-reminder-alist' to nil.
