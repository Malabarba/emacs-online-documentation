feedmail-vm-mail-mode is a compiled Lisp function in `feedmail.el'.<br/><br/>(feedmail-vm-mail-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Make something like a buffer that has been created via `vm-mail'.<br/>The optional argument is ignored and is just for argument compatibility with<br/>`feedmail-queue-runner-mode-setter'.  This function is suitable for being<br/>applied to a file after you've just read it from disk: for example, a<br/>feedmail FQM message file from a queue.  You could use something like<br/>this:<br/><br/>(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.fqm$" . feedmail-vm-mail-mode) auto-mode-alist))<br/>
