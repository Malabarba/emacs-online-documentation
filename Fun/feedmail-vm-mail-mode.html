<strong>feedmail-vm-mail-mode</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(feedmail-vm-mail-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Make something like a buffer that has been created via `vm-mail'.</br>
The optional argument is ignored and is just for argument compatibility with</br>
`feedmail-queue-runner-mode-setter'.  This function is suitable for being</br>
applied to a file after you've just read it from disk: for example, a</br>
feedmail FQM message file from a queue.  You could use something like</br>
this:</br>
</br>
<code>(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.fqm$" . feedmail-vm-mail-mode) auto-mode-alist)</code>)</br>
