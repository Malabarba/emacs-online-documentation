ff-find-other-file is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `find-file.el'.<br/><br/>(ff-find-other-file &optional IN-OTHER-WINDOW IGNORE-INCLUDE)<br/><br/>Find the header or source file corresponding to this file.<br/>Being on a `#include' line pulls in that file.<br/><br/>If optional IN-OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, find the file in the other window.<br/>If optional IGNORE-INCLUDE is non-nil, ignore being on `#include' lines.<br/><br/>Variables of interest include:<br/><br/> - `ff-case-fold-search'<br/>   Non-nil means ignore cases in matches (see `case-fold-search').<br/>   If you have extensions in different cases, you will want this to be nil.<br/><br/> - `ff-always-in-other-window'<br/>   If non-nil, always open the other file in another window, unless an<br/>   argument is given to `ff-find-other-file'.<br/><br/> - `ff-ignore-include'<br/>   If non-nil, ignores #include lines.<br/><br/> - `ff-always-try-to-create'<br/>   If non-nil, always attempt to create the other file if it was not found.<br/><br/> - `ff-quiet-mode'<br/>   If non-nil, traces which directories are being searched.<br/><br/> - `ff-special-constructs'<br/>   A list of regular expressions specifying how to recognize special<br/>   constructs such as include files etc, and an associated method for<br/>   extracting the filename from that construct.<br/><br/> - `ff-other-file-alist'<br/>   Alist of extensions to find given the current file's extension.<br/><br/> - `ff-search-directories'<br/>   List of directories searched through with each extension specified in<br/>   `ff-other-file-alist' that matches this file's extension.<br/><br/> - `ff-pre-find-hook'<br/>   List of functions to be called before the search for the file starts.<br/><br/> - `ff-pre-load-hook'<br/>   List of functions to be called before the other file is loaded.<br/><br/> - `ff-post-load-hook'<br/>   List of functions to be called after the other file is loaded.<br/><br/> - `ff-not-found-hook'<br/>   List of functions to be called if the other file could not be found.<br/><br/> - `ff-file-created-hook'<br/>   List of functions to be called if the other file has been created.
