<strong>ffap-kpathsea-expand-path</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ffap.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ffap-kpathsea-expand-path <u>PATH</u>)</br>
</br>
Replace each "//"-suffixed dir in <u>PATH</u> by a list of its subdirs.</br>
The subdirs begin with the original directory, and the depth of the</br>
search is bounded by `ffap-kpathsea-depth'.  This is intended to mimic</br>
kpathsea, a library used by some versions of TeX.
