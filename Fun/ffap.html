<strong>ffap</strong> is an alias for `find-file-at-point' in `<code>ffap.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ffap &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Find FILENAME, guessing a default from text around point.<br/>
If `ffap-url-regexp' is not nil, the FILENAME may also be an URL.<br/>
With a prefix, this command behaves exactly like `ffap-file-finder'.<br/>
If `ffap-require-prefix' is set, the prefix meaning is reversed.<br/>
See also the variables `ffap-dired-wildcards', `ffap-newfile-prompt',<br/>
and the functions `ffap-file-at-point' and `ffap-url-at-point'.
