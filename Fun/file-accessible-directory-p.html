<strong>file-accessible-directory-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-accessible-directory-p <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return t if file <u>FILENAME</u> names a directory you can open.</br>
For the value to be t, <u>FILENAME</u> must specify the name of a directory as a file,</br>
and the directory must allow you to open files in it.  In order to use a</br>
directory as a buffer's current directory, this predicate must return true.</br>
A directory name spec may be given instead; then the value is t</br>
if the directory so specified exists and really is a readable and</br>
searchable directory.
