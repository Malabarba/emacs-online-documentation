<strong>file-attributes</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-attributes <u>FILENAME</u> &optional <u>ID-FORMAT</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a list of attributes of file <u>FILENAME</u>.</br>
Value is nil if specified file cannot be opened.</br>
</br>
<u>ID-FORMAT</u> specifies the preferred format of attributes uid and gid (see</br>
below) - valid values are 'string and 'integer.  The latter is the</br>
default, but we plan to change that, so you should specify a non-nil value</br>
for <u>ID-FORMAT</u> if you use the returned uid or gid.</br>
</br>
Elements of the attribute list are:</br>
 0. t for directory, string (name linked to) for symbolic link, or nil.</br>
 1. Number of links to file.</br>
 2. File uid as a string or a number.  If a string value cannot be</br>
  looked up, a numeric value, either an integer or a float, is returned.</br>
 3. File gid, likewise.</br>
 4. Last access time, as a list of integers (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC) in the</br>
  same style as (current-time).</br>
  (See a note below about access time on FAT-based filesystems.)</br>
 5. Last modification time, likewise.  This is the time of the last</br>
  change to the file's contents.</br>
 6. Last status change time, likewise.  This is the time of last change</br>
  to the file's attributes: owner and group, access mode bits, etc.</br>
 7. Size in bytes.</br>
  This is a floating point number if the size is too large for an integer.</br>
 8. File modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes as in ls -l.</br>
 9. An unspecified value, present only for backward compatibility.</br>
10. inode number.  If it is larger than what an Emacs integer can hold,</br>
  this is of the form (HIGH . LOW): first the high bits, then the low 16 bits.</br>
  If even HIGH is too large for an Emacs integer, this is instead of the form</br>
  (HIGH MIDDLE . LOW): first the high bits, then the middle 24 bits,</br>
  and finally the low 16 bits.</br>
11. Filesystem device number.  If it is larger than what the Emacs</br>
  integer can hold, this is a cons cell, similar to the inode number.</br>
</br>
On most filesystems, the combination of the inode and the device</br>
number uniquely identifies the file.</br>
</br>
On MS-Windows, performance depends on `w32-get-true-file-attributes',</br>
which see.</br>
</br>
On some FAT-based filesystems, only the date of last access is recorded,</br>
so last access time will always be midnight of that day.
