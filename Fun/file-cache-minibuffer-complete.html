<strong>file-cache-minibuffer-complete</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>filecache.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(file-cache-minibuffer-complete <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Complete a filename in the minibuffer using a preloaded cache.</br>
Filecache does two kinds of substitution: it completes on names in</br>
the cache, and, once it has found a unique name, it cycles through</br>
the directories that the name is available in.  With a prefix argument,</br>
the name is considered already unique; only the second substitution</br>
(directories) is done.
