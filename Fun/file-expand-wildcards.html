<strong>file-expand-wildcards</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-expand-wildcards <u>PATTERN</u> &optional <u>FULL</u>)</br>
</br>
Expand wildcard pattern <u>PATTERN</u>.</br>
This returns a list of file names which match the pattern.</br>
</br>
If <u>PATTERN</u> is written as an absolute file name,</br>
the values are absolute also.</br>
</br>
If <u>PATTERN</u> is written as a relative file name, it is interpreted</br>
relative to the current default directory, `default-directory'.</br>
The file names returned are normally also relative to the current</br>
default directory.  However, if <u>FULL</u> is non-nil, they are absolute.
