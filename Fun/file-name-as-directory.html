<strong>file-name-as-directory</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-name-as-directory <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a string representing the file name <u>FILE</u> interpreted as a directory.</br>
This operation exists because a directory is also a file, but its name as</br>
a directory is different from its name as a file.</br>
The result can be used as the value of `default-directory'</br>
or passed as second argument to `expand-file-name'.</br>
For a Unix-syntax file name, just appends a slash.
