<br/>
(file-name-extension FILENAME &optional PERIOD)<br/>
<br/>
Return FILENAME's final "extension".<br/>
The extension, in a file name, is the part that follows the last `.',<br/>
excluding version numbers and backup suffixes,<br/>
except that a leading `.', if any, doesn't count.<br/>
Return nil for extensionless file names such as `foo'.<br/>
Return the empty string for file names such as `foo.'.<br/>
<br/>
If PERIOD is non-nil, then the returned value includes the period<br/>
that delimits the extension, and if FILENAME has no extension,<br/>
the value is "".
