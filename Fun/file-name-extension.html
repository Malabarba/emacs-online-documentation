<strong>file-name-extension</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-name-extension <u>FILENAME</u> &optional <u>PERIOD</u>)</br>
</br>
Return <u>FILENAME</u>'s final "extension".</br>
The extension, in a file name, is the part that follows the last `.',</br>
excluding version numbers and backup suffixes,</br>
except that a leading `.', if any, doesn't count.</br>
Return nil for extensionless file names such as `foo'.</br>
Return the empty string for file names such as `foo.'.</br>
</br>
If <u>PERIOD</u> is non-nil, then the returned value includes the period</br>
that delimits the extension, and if <u>FILENAME</u> has no extension,</br>
the value is "".
