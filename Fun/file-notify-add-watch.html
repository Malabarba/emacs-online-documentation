</br>
(file-notify-add-watch <u>FILE</u> <u>FLAGS</u> <u>CALLBACK</u>)</br>
</br>
Add a watch for filesystem events pertaining to <u>FILE</u>.</br>
This arranges for filesystem events pertaining to <u>FILE</u> to be reported</br>
to Emacs.  Use `file-notify-rm-watch' to cancel the watch.</br>
</br>
The returned value is a descriptor for the added watch.  If the</br>
file cannot be watched for some reason, this function signals a</br>
`file-notify-error' error.</br>
</br>
<u>FLAGS</u> is a list of conditions to set what will be watched for.  It can</br>
include the following symbols:</br>
</br>
  `change'           -- watch for file changes</br>
  `attribute-change' -- watch for file attributes changes, like</br>
                        permissions or modification time</br>
</br>
If <u>FILE</u> is a directory, 'change' watches for file creation or</br>
deletion in that directory.  This does not work recursively.</br>
</br>
When any event happens, Emacs will call the <u>CALLBACK</u> function passing</br>
it a single argument EVENT, which is of the form</br>
</br>
  (DESCRIPTOR ACTION <u>FILE</u> [FILE1])</br>
</br>
DESCRIPTOR is the same object as the one returned by this function.</br>
ACTION is the description of the event.  It could be any one of the</br>
following:</br>
</br>
  `created'           -- <u>FILE</u> was created</br>
  `deleted'           -- <u>FILE</u> was deleted</br>
  `changed'           -- <u>FILE</u> has changed</br>
  `renamed'           -- <u>FILE</u> has been renamed to FILE1</br>
  `attribute-changed' -- a <u>FILE</u> attribute was changed</br>
</br>
<u>FILE</u> is the name of the file whose event is being reported.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
