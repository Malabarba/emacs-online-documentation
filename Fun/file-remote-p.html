<strong>file-remote-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(file-remote-p FILE &optional IDENTIFICATION CONNECTED)<br/>
<br/>
Test whether FILE specifies a location on a remote system.<br/>
A file is considered remote if accessing it is likely to<br/>
be slower or less reliable than accessing local files.<br/>
<br/>
`file-remote-p' never opens a new remote connection.  It can<br/>
only reuse a connection that is already open.<br/>
<br/>
Return nil or a string identifying the remote connection<br/>
(ideally a prefix of FILE).  Return nil if FILE is a relative<br/>
file name.<br/>
<br/>
When IDENTIFICATION is nil, the returned string is a complete<br/>
remote identifier: with components method, user, and host.  The<br/>
components are those present in FILE, with defaults filled in for<br/>
any that are missing.<br/>
<br/>
IDENTIFICATION can specify which part of the identification to<br/>
return.  IDENTIFICATION can be the symbol `method', `user',<br/>
`host', or `localname'.  Any other value is handled like nil and<br/>
means to return the complete identification.  The string returned<br/>
for IDENTIFICATION `localname' can differ depending on whether<br/>
there is an existing connection.<br/>
<br/>
If CONNECTED is non-nil, return an identification only if FILE is<br/>
located on a remote system and a connection is established to<br/>
that remote system.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: You can use this expansion of remote identifier components<br/>
     to derive a new remote file name from an existing one.  For<br/>
     example, if FILE is "/sudo::/path/to/file" then<br/>
<br/>
       (concat (file-remote-p FILE) "/bin/sh")<br/>
<br/>
     returns a remote file name for file "/bin/sh" that has the<br/>
     same remote identifier as FILE but expanded; a name such as<br/>
     "/sudo:root@myhost:/bin/sh".
