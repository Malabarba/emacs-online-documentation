<strong>file-tree-walk</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-tree-walk <u>DIR</u> <u>ACTION</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Walk <u>DIR</u> executing <u>ACTION</u> on each file, with <u>ARGS</u> as additional arguments.</br>
For each file, the function calls <u>ACTION</u> as follows:</br>
</br>
   (<u>ACTION</u> DIRECTORY BASENAME <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Where DIRECTORY is the leading directory of the file,</br>
      BASENAME is the basename of the file,</br>
      and <u>ARGS</u> are as specified in the call to this function, or nil if omitted.</br>
</br>
The <u>ACTION</u> is applied to each subdirectory before descending into</br>
it, and if nil is returned at that point, the descent will be</br>
prevented.  Directory entries are sorted with string-lessp.
