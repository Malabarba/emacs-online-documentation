<strong>file-truename</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(file-truename <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the truename of <u>FILENAME</u>.</br>
If <u>FILENAME</u> is not absolute, first expands it against `default-directory'.</br>

containing it, until no links are left at any level.
