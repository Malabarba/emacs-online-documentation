<strong>fill-context-prefix</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>fill.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(fill-context-prefix FROM TO &optional FIRST-LINE-REGEXP)<br/>
<br/>
Compute a fill prefix from the text between FROM and TO.<br/>
This uses the variables `adaptive-fill-regexp' and `adaptive-fill-function'<br/>
and `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp'.  `paragraph-start' also plays a role;<br/>
we reject a prefix based on a one-line paragraph if that prefix would<br/>
act as a paragraph-separator.
