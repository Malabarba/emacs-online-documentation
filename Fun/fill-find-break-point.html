<strong>fill-find-break-point</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>fill.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(fill-find-break-point <u>LIMIT</u>)</br>
</br>
Move point to a proper line breaking position of the current line.</br>
Don't move back past the buffer position <u>LIMIT</u>.</br>
</br>
This function is called when we are going to break the current line</br>
after or before a non-ASCII character.  If the charset of the</br>
character has the property `fill-find-break-point-function', this</br>
function calls the property value as a function with one arg <u>LIMIT</u>.</br>
If the charset has no such property, do nothing.
