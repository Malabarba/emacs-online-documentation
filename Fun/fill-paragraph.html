fill-paragraph is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `fill.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to M-q.<br/><br/>(fill-paragraph &optional JUSTIFY REGION)<br/><br/>Fill paragraph at or after point.<br/><br/>If JUSTIFY is non-nil (interactively, with prefix argument), justify as well.<br/>If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one<br/>space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.<br/>The variable `fill-column' controls the width for filling.<br/><br/>If `fill-paragraph-function' is non-nil, we call it (passing our<br/>argument to it), and if it returns non-nil, we simply return its value.<br/><br/>If `fill-paragraph-function' is nil, return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.<br/><br/>The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that<br/>case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,<br/>call `fill-region' to fill each of the paragraphs in the active<br/>region, instead of just filling the current paragraph.
