fill-region-as-paragraph is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `fill.el'.<br/><br/>(fill-region-as-paragraph FROM TO &optional JUSTIFY NOSQUEEZE SQUEEZE-AFTER)<br/><br/>Fill the region as one paragraph.<br/>It removes any paragraph breaks in the region and extra newlines at the end,<br/>indents and fills lines between the margins given by the<br/>`current-left-margin' and `current-fill-column' functions.<br/>(In most cases, the variable `fill-column' controls the width.)<br/>It leaves point at the beginning of the line following the paragraph.<br/><br/>Normally performs justification according to the `current-justification'<br/>function, but with a prefix arg, does full justification instead.<br/><br/>From a program, optional third arg JUSTIFY can specify any type of<br/>justification.  Fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means not to make spaces<br/>between words canonical before filling.  Fifth arg SQUEEZE-AFTER, if non-nil,<br/>means don't canonicalize spaces before that position.<br/><br/>Return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.<br/><br/>If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one<br/>space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.
