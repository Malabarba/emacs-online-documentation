<strong>fill-region-as-paragraph</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>fill.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(fill-region-as-paragraph <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u> &optional <u>JUSTIFY</u> <u>NOSQUEEZE</u> <u>SQUEEZE-AFTER</u>)</br>
</br>
Fill the region as one paragraph.</br>
It removes any paragraph breaks in the region and extra newlines at the end,</br>
indents and fills lines between the margins given by the</br>
`current-left-margin' and `current-fill-column' functions.</br>
(In most cases, the variable `fill-column' controls the width.)</br>
It leaves point at the beginning of the line following the paragraph.</br>
</br>
Normally performs justification according to the `current-justification'</br>
function, but with a prefix arg, does full justification instead.</br>
</br>
From a program, optional third arg <u>JUSTIFY</u> can specify any type of</br>
justification.  Fourth arg <u>NOSQUEEZE</u> non-nil means not to make spaces</br>
between words canonical before filling.  Fifth arg <u>SQUEEZE-AFTER</u>, if non-nil,</br>
means don't canonicalize spaces before that position.</br>
</br>
Return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.</br>
</br>
If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one</br>
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.
