fill-region is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `fill.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <menu-bar> <edit> <fill>.<br/><br/>(fill-region FROM TO &optional JUSTIFY NOSQUEEZE TO-EOP)<br/><br/>Fill each of the paragraphs in the region.<br/>A prefix arg means justify as well.<br/>The `fill-column' variable controls the width.<br/><br/>Noninteractively, the third argument JUSTIFY specifies which<br/>kind of justification to do: `full', `left', `right', `center',<br/>or `none' (equivalent to nil).  A value of t means handle each<br/>paragraph as specified by its text properties.<br/><br/>The fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means to leave whitespace other<br/>than line breaks untouched, and fifth arg TO-EOP non-nil means<br/>to keep filling to the end of the paragraph (or next hard newline,<br/>if variable `use-hard-newlines' is on).<br/><br/>Return the fill-prefix used for filling the last paragraph.<br/><br/>If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one<br/>space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.
