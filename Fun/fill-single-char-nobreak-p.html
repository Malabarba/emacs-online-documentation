<strong>fill-single-char-nobreak-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>fill.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(fill-single-char-nobreak-p)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if a one-letter word is before point.</br>
This function is suitable for adding to the hook `fill-nobreak-predicate',</br>

which is an error according to some typographical conventions.
