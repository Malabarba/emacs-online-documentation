<strong>filter-buffer-substring</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(filter-buffer-substring BEG END &optional DELETE)<br/>
<br/>
Return the buffer substring between BEG and END, after filtering.<br/>
The wrapper hook `filter-buffer-substring-functions' performs<br/>
the actual filtering.  The obsolete variable `buffer-substring-filters'<br/>
is also consulted.  If both of these are nil, no filtering is done.<br/>
<br/>
If DELETE is non-nil, the text between BEG and END is deleted<br/>
from the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
This function should be used instead of `buffer-substring',<br/>
`buffer-substring-no-properties', or `delete-and-extract-region'<br/>
when you want to allow filtering to take place.  For example,<br/>
major or minor modes can use `filter-buffer-substring-functions' to<br/>
extract characters that are special to a buffer, and should not<br/>
be copied into other buffers.
