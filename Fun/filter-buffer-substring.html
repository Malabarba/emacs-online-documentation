<strong>filter-buffer-substring</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(filter-buffer-substring <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> &optional <u>DELETE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the buffer substring between <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u>, after filtering.</br>
If <u>DELETE</u> is non-nil, delete the text between <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> from the buffer.</br>
</br>
This calls the function that `filter-buffer-substring-function' specifies</br>
(passing the same three arguments that it received) to do the work,</br>
and returns whatever it does.  The default function does no filtering,</br>
unless a hook has been set.</br>
</br>
Use `filter-buffer-substring' instead of `buffer-substring',</br>
`buffer-substring-no-properties', or `delete-and-extract-region' when</br>
you want to allow filtering to take place.  For example, major or minor</br>
modes can use `filter-buffer-substring-function' to extract characters</br>
that are special to a buffer, and should not be copied into other buffers.
