find-change-log is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `add-log.el'.<br/><br/>(find-change-log &optional FILE-NAME BUFFER-FILE)<br/><br/>Find a change log file for M-x add-change-log-entry and return the name.<br/><br/>Optional arg FILE-NAME specifies the file to use.<br/>If FILE-NAME is nil, use the value of `change-log-default-name'.<br/>If `change-log-default-name' is nil, behave as though it were 'ChangeLog'<br/>(or whatever we use on this operating system).<br/><br/>If `change-log-default-name' contains a leading directory component, then<br/>simply find it in the current directory.  Otherwise, search in the current<br/>directory and its successive parents for a file so named.<br/><br/>Once a file is found, `change-log-default-name' is set locally in the<br/>current buffer to the complete file name.<br/>Optional arg BUFFER-FILE overrides `buffer-file-name'.
