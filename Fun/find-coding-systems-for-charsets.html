<strong>find-coding-systems-for-charsets</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(find-coding-systems-for-charsets <u>CHARSETS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode characters of <u>CHARSETS</u>.</br>
<u>CHARSETS</u> is a list of character sets.</br>
</br>
This only finds coding systems of type `charset', whose</br>
`:charset-list' property includes all of <u>CHARSETS</u> (plus `ascii' for</br>
ASCII-compatible coding systems).  It was used in older versions of</br>
Emacs, but is unlikely to be what you really want now.
