find-composition is a compiled Lisp function in `composite.el'.<br/><br/>(find-composition POS &optional LIMIT STRING DETAIL-P)<br/><br/>Return information about a composition at or near buffer position POS.<br/><br/>If the character at POS has `composition' property, the value is a list<br/>(FROM TO VALID-P).<br/><br/>FROM and TO specify the range of text that has the same `composition'<br/>property, VALID-P is t if this composition is valid, and nil if not.<br/><br/>If there's no composition at POS, and the optional 2nd argument LIMIT<br/>is non-nil, search for a composition toward the position given by LIMIT.<br/><br/>If no composition is found, return nil.<br/><br/>Optional 3rd argument STRING, if non-nil, is a string to look for a<br/>composition in; nil means the current buffer.<br/><br/>If a valid composition is found and the optional 4th argument DETAIL-P<br/>is non-nil, the return value is a list of the form<br/><br/>   (FROM TO COMPONENTS RELATIVE-P MOD-FUNC WIDTH)<br/><br/>COMPONENTS is a vector of integers, the meaning depends on RELATIVE-P.<br/><br/>RELATIVE-P is t if the composition method is relative, else nil.<br/><br/>If RELATIVE-P is t, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters to be<br/>composed.  If RELATIVE-P is nil, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters<br/>and composition rules as described in `compose-region'.<br/><br/>MOD-FUNC is a modification function of the composition.<br/><br/>WIDTH is a number of columns the composition occupies on the screen.<br/><br/>When Automatic Composition mode is on, this function also finds a<br/>chunk of text that is automatically composed.  If such a chunk is<br/>found closer to POS than the position that has `composition'<br/>property, the value is a list of FROM, TO, and a glyph-string<br/>that specifies how the chunk is to be composed.  See the function<br/>`composition-get-gstring' for the format of the glyph-string.
