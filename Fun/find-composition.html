</br>
(find-composition <u>POS</u> &optional <u>LIMIT</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>DETAIL-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Return information about a composition at or near buffer position <u>POS</u>.</br>
</br>
If the character at <u>POS</u> has `composition' property, the value is a list</br>
(FROM TO VALID-P).</br>
</br>
FROM and TO specify the range of text that has the same `composition'</br>
property, VALID-P is t if this composition is valid, and nil if not.</br>
</br>
If there's no composition at <u>POS</u>, and the optional 2nd argument <u>LIMIT</u></br>
is non-nil, search for a composition toward the position given by <u>LIMIT</u>.</br>
</br>
If no composition is found, return nil.</br>
</br>
Optional 3rd argument <u>STRING</u>, if non-nil, is a string to look for a</br>
composition in; nil means the current buffer.</br>
</br>
If a valid composition is found and the optional 4th argument <u>DETAIL-P</u></br>
is non-nil, the return value is a list of the form</br>
</br>
   (FROM TO COMPONENTS RELATIVE-P MOD-FUNC WIDTH)</br>
</br>
COMPONENTS is a vector of integers, the meaning depends on RELATIVE-P.</br>
</br>
RELATIVE-P is t if the composition method is relative, else nil.</br>
</br>
If RELATIVE-P is t, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters to be</br>
composed.  If RELATIVE-P is nil, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters</br>
and composition rules as described in `compose-region'.</br>
</br>
MOD-FUNC is a modification function of the composition.</br>
</br>
WIDTH is a number of columns the composition occupies on the screen.</br>
</br>
When Automatic Composition mode is on, this function also finds a</br>
chunk of text that is automatically composed.  If such a chunk is</br>
found closer to <u>POS</u> than the position that has `composition'</br>
property, the value is a list of FROM, TO, and a glyph-string</br>
that specifies how the chunk is to be composed.  See the function</br>
`composition-get-gstring' for the format of the glyph-string.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
