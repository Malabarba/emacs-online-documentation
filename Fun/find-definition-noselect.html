<strong>find-definition-noselect</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>find-func.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(find-definition-noselect SYMBOL TYPE &optional FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Return a pair `(BUFFER . POINT)' pointing to the definition of SYMBOL.<br/>
If the definition can't be found in the buffer, return (BUFFER).<br/>
TYPE says what type of definition: nil for a function, `defvar' for a<br/>
variable, `defface' for a face.  This function does not switch to the<br/>
buffer nor display it.<br/>
<br/>
The library where SYMBOL is defined is searched for in FILE or<br/>
`find-function-source-path', if non-nil, otherwise in `load-path'.
