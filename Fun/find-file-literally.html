<strong>find-file-literally</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(find-file-literally <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Visit file <u>FILENAME</u> with no conversion of any kind.</br>
Format conversion and character code conversion are both disabled,</br>
and multibyte characters are disabled in the resulting buffer.</br>
The major mode used is Fundamental mode regardless of the file name,</br>
and local variable specifications in the file are ignored.</br>
Automatic uncompression and adding a newline at the end of the</br>
file due to `require-final-newline' is also disabled.</br>
</br>
You cannot absolutely rely on this function to result in</br>
visiting the file literally.  If Emacs already has a buffer</br>
which is visiting the file, you get the existing buffer,</br>
regardless of whether it was created literally or not.</br>
</br>
In a Lisp program, if you want to be sure of accessing a file's</br>
contents literally, you should create a temporary buffer and then read</br>
the file contents into it using `insert-file-contents-literally'.
