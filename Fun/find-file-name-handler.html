find-file-name-handler is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(find-file-name-handler FILENAME OPERATION)<br/><br/>Return FILENAME's handler function for OPERATION, if it has one.<br/>Otherwise, return nil.<br/>A file name is handled if one of the regular expressions in<br/>`file-name-handler-alist' matches it.<br/><br/>If OPERATION equals `inhibit-file-name-operation', then we ignore<br/>any handlers that are members of `inhibit-file-name-handlers',<br/>but we still do run any other handlers.  This lets handlers<br/>use the standard functions without calling themselves recursively.
