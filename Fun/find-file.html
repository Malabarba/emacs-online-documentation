<strong>find-file</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <open>, C-x C-f, <menu-bar> <file> <new-file>.<br/>
<br/>
(find-file FILENAME &optional WILDCARDS)<br/>
<br/>
Edit file FILENAME.<br/>
Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME,<br/>
creating one if none already exists.<br/>
Interactively, the default if you just type RET is the current directory,<br/>
but the visited file name is available through the minibuffer history:<br/>
type M-n to pull it into the minibuffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can visit files on remote machines by specifying something<br/>
like /ssh:SOME_REMOTE_MACHINE:FILE for the file name.  You can<br/>
also visit local files as a different user by specifying<br/>
/sudo::FILE for the file name.<br/>
See the Info node `(tramp)Filename Syntax' in the Tramp Info<br/>
manual, for more about this.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,<br/>
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.  You can<br/>
suppress wildcard expansion by setting `find-file-wildcards' to nil.<br/>
<br/>
To visit a file without any kind of conversion and without<br/>
automatically choosing a major mode, use M-x find-file-literally.
