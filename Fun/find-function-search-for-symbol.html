<strong>find-function-search-for-symbol</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>find-func.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(find-function-search-for-symbol SYMBOL TYPE LIBRARY)<br/>
<br/>
Search for SYMBOL's definition of type TYPE in LIBRARY.<br/>
Visit the library in a buffer, and return a cons cell (BUFFER . POSITION),<br/>
or just (BUFFER . nil) if the definition can't be found in the file.<br/>
<br/>
If TYPE is nil, look for a function definition.<br/>
Otherwise, TYPE specifies the kind of definition,<br/>
and it is interpreted via `find-function-regexp-alist'.<br/>
The search is done in the source for library LIBRARY.
