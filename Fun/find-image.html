find-image is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `image.el'.<br/><br/>(find-image SPECS)<br/><br/>Find an image, choosing one of a list of image specifications.<br/><br/>SPECS is a list of image specifications.<br/><br/>Each image specification in SPECS is a property list.  The contents of<br/>a specification are image type dependent.  All specifications must at<br/>least contain the properties `:type TYPE' and either `:file FILE' or<br/>`:data DATA', where TYPE is a symbol specifying the image type,<br/>e.g. `xbm', FILE is the file to load the image from, and DATA is a<br/>string containing the actual image data.  The specification whose TYPE<br/>is supported, and FILE exists, is used to construct the image<br/>specification to be returned.  Return nil if no specification is<br/>satisfied.<br/><br/>The image is looked for in `image-load-path'.<br/><br/>Image files should not be larger than specified by `max-image-size'.
