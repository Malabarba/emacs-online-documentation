<strong>find-operation-coding-system</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(find-operation-coding-system OPERATION ARGUMENTS...)<br/>
<br/>
Choose a coding system for an operation based on the target name.<br/>
The value names a pair of coding systems: (DECODING-SYSTEM . ENCODING-SYSTEM).<br/>
DECODING-SYSTEM is the coding system to use for decoding<br/>
(in case OPERATION does decoding), and ENCODING-SYSTEM is the coding system<br/>
for encoding (in case OPERATION does encoding).<br/>
<br/>
The first argument OPERATION specifies an I/O primitive:<br/>
  For file I/O, `insert-file-contents' or `write-region'.<br/>
  For process I/O, `call-process', `call-process-region', or `start-process'.<br/>
  For network I/O, `open-network-stream'.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining arguments should be the same arguments that were passed<br/>
to the primitive.  Depending on which primitive, one of those arguments<br/>
is selected as the TARGET.  For example, if OPERATION does file I/O,<br/>
whichever argument specifies the file name is TARGET.<br/>
<br/>
TARGET has a meaning which depends on OPERATION:<br/>
  For file I/O, TARGET is a file name (except for the special case below).<br/>
  For process I/O, TARGET is a process name.<br/>
  For network I/O, TARGET is a service name or a port number.<br/>
<br/>
This function looks up what is specified for TARGET in<br/>
`file-coding-system-alist', `process-coding-system-alist',<br/>
or `network-coding-system-alist' depending on OPERATION.<br/>
They may specify a coding system, a cons of coding systems,<br/>
or a function symbol to call.<br/>
In the last case, we call the function with one argument,<br/>
which is a list of all the arguments given to this function.<br/>
If the function can't decide a coding system, it can return<br/>
`undecided' so that the normal code-detection is performed.<br/>
<br/>
If OPERATION is `insert-file-contents', the argument corresponding to<br/>
TARGET may be a cons (FILENAME . BUFFER).  In that case, FILENAME is a<br/>
file name to look up, and BUFFER is a buffer that contains the file's<br/>
contents (not yet decoded).  If `file-coding-system-alist' specifies a<br/>
function to call for FILENAME, that function should examine the<br/>
contents of BUFFER instead of reading the file.
