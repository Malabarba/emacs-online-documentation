<strong>find-tag-noselect</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>etags.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(find-tag-noselect TAGNAME &optional NEXT-P REGEXP-P)<br/>
<br/>
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.<br/>
Returns the buffer containing the tag's definition and moves its point there,<br/>
but does not select the buffer.<br/>
The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer near point.<br/>
<br/>
If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for<br/>
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are<br/>
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P<br/>
is the atom `-' (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number<br/>
or just M--), pop back to the previous tag gone to.<br/>
<br/>
If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.<br/>
<br/>
A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed<br/>
onto a ring and may be popped back to with M-*.<br/>
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.<br/>
