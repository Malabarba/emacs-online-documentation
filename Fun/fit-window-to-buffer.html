fit-window-to-buffer is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(fit-window-to-buffer &optional WINDOW MAX-HEIGHT MIN-HEIGHT)<br/><br/>Adjust height of WINDOW to display its buffer's contents exactly.<br/>WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/><br/>Optional argument MAX-HEIGHT specifies the maximum height of<br/>WINDOW and defaults to the height of WINDOW's frame.  Optional<br/>argument MIN-HEIGHT specifies the minimum height of WINDOW and<br/>defaults to `window-min-height'.  Both MAX-HEIGHT and MIN-HEIGHT<br/>are specified in lines and include the mode line and header line,<br/>if any.<br/><br/>If WINDOW is a full height window, then if the option<br/>`fit-frame-to-buffer' is non-nil, this calls the function<br/>`fit-frame-to-buffer' to adjust the frame height.<br/><br/>Return the number of lines by which WINDOW was enlarged or<br/>shrunk.  If an error occurs during resizing, return nil but don't<br/>signal an error.<br/><br/>Note that even if this function makes WINDOW large enough to show<br/>_all_ lines of its buffer you might not see the first lines when<br/>WINDOW was scrolled.
