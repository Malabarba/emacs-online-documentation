<strong>flet</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cl.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(flet ((<u>FUNC</u> <u>ARGLIST</u> <u>BODY</u>...) ...) <u>FORM</u>...)</br>
</br>
This macro is obsolete since 24.3;</br>
use either `cl-flet' or `cl-letf'.</br>
</br>
Make temporary overriding function definitions.</br>
This is an analogue of a dynamically scoped `let' that operates on the function</br>
cell of <u>FUNC</u>s rather than their value cell.</br>
If you want the Common-Lisp style of `flet', you should use `cl-flet'.</br>
The <u>FORM</u>s are evaluated with the specified function definitions in place,</br>
then the definitions are undone (the <u>FUNC</u>s go back to their previous</br>
definitions, or lack thereof).
