flet is a Lisp macro in `cl.el'.<br/><br/>(flet ((FUNC ARGLIST BODY...) ...) FORM...)<br/><br/>This macro is obsolete since 24.3;<br/>use either `cl-flet' or `cl-letf'.<br/><br/>Make temporary overriding function definitions.<br/>This is an analogue of a dynamically scoped `let' that operates on the function<br/>cell of FUNCs rather than their value cell.<br/>If you want the Common-Lisp style of `flet', you should use `cl-flet'.<br/>The FORMs are evaluated with the specified function definitions in place,<br/>then the definitions are undone (the FUNCs go back to their previous<br/>definitions, or lack thereof).
