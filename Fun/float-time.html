<strong>float-time</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(float-time &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)<br/>
<br/>
Return the current time, as a float number of seconds since the epoch.<br/>
If SPECIFIED-TIME is given, it is the time to convert to float<br/>
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the form<br/>
(HIGH LOW) or (HIGH LOW USEC) or (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC).  Thus,<br/>
you can use times from `current-time' and from `file-attributes'.<br/>
SPECIFIED-TIME can also have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is<br/>
considered obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: Since the result is floating point, it may not be exact.<br/>
If precise time stamps are required, use either `current-time',<br/>
or (if you need time as a string) `format-time-string'.
