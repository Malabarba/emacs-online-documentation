<strong>flush-lines</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(flush-lines <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>RSTART</u> <u>REND</u> <u>INTERACTIVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete lines containing matches for <u>REGEXP</u>.</br>
When called from Lisp (and usually when called interactively as</br>
well, see below), applies to the part of the buffer after point.</br>
The line point is in is deleted if and only if it contains a</br>
match for regexp starting after point.</br>
</br>
If <u>REGEXP</u> contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')</br>
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</br>
</br>
Second and third arg <u>RSTART</u> and <u>REND</u> specify the region to operate on.</br>
Lines partially contained in this region are deleted if and only if</br>
they contain a match entirely contained in it.</br>
</br>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate</br>
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the</br>
end of (the accessible portion of) the buffer.  When calling this function</br>
from Lisp, you can pretend that it was called interactively by passing</br>
a non-nil <u>INTERACTIVE</u> argument.</br>
</br>
If a match is split across lines, all the lines it lies in are deleted.</br>
They are deleted _before_ looking for the next match.  Hence, a match</br>
starting on the same line at which another match ended is ignored.
