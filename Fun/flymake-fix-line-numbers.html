<strong>flymake-fix-line-numbers</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>flymake.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(flymake-fix-line-numbers <u>ERR-INFO-LIST</u> <u>MIN-LINE</u> <u>MAX-LINE</u>)</br>
</br>
Replace line numbers with fixed value.</br>
If line-numbers is less than <u>MIN-LINE</u>, set line numbers to <u>MIN-LINE</u>.</br>
If line numbers is greater than <u>MAX-LINE</u>, set line numbers to <u>MAX-LINE</u>.</br>
The reason for this fix is because some compilers might report</br>
line number outside the file being compiled.
