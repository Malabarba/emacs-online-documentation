<strong>follow-delete-other-windows-and-split</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>follow.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(follow-delete-other-windows-and-split &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Create two side by side windows and enter Follow mode.</br>
</br>
Execute this command to display as much as possible of the text</br>
in the selected window.  All other windows, in the current</br>
frame, are deleted and the selected window is split in two</br>
side-by-side windows.  Follow mode is activated, hence the</br>
two windows always will display two successive pages.</br>
(If one window is moved, the other one will follow.)</br>
</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is positive, the leftmost window is selected.  If negative,</br>
the rightmost is selected.  If <u>ARG</u> is nil, the leftmost window is</br>
selected if the original window is the first one in the frame.
