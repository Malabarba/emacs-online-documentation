<strong>follow-scroll-down</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>follow.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(follow-scroll-down &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Scroll text in a Follow mode window chain down.<br/>
<br/>
If called with no ARG, the `next-screen-context-lines' top lines of<br/>
the top window in the chain will be visible in the bottom window.<br/>
<br/>
If called with an argument, scroll ARG lines down.<br/>
Negative ARG means scroll upward.<br/>
<br/>
Works like `scroll-up' when not in Follow mode.
