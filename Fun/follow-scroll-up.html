<strong>follow-scroll-up</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>follow.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(follow-scroll-up &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Scroll text in a Follow mode window chain up.<br/>
<br/>
If called with no ARG, the `next-screen-context-lines' last lines of<br/>
the bottom window in the chain will be visible in the top window.<br/>
<br/>
If called with an argument, scroll ARG lines up.<br/>
Negative ARG means scroll downward.<br/>
<br/>
Works like `scroll-up' when not in Follow mode.
