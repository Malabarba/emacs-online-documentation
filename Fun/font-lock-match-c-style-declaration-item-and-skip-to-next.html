<strong>font-lock-match-c-style-declaration-item-and-skip-to-next</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>font-lock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(font-lock-match-c-style-declaration-item-and-skip-to-next <u>LIMIT</u>)</br>
</br>
Match, and move over, any declaration/definition item after point.</br>
Matches after point, but ignores leading whitespace and `*' characters.</br>
Does not move further than <u>LIMIT</u>.</br>
</br>
The expected syntax of a declaration/definition item is `word' (preceded by</br>
optional whitespace and `*' characters and proceeded by optional whitespace)</br>
optionally followed by a `('.  Everything following the item (but belonging to</br>
it) is expected to be skip-able by `scan-sexps', and items are expected to be</br>
separated with a `,' and to be terminated with a `;'.</br>
</br>
Thus the regexp matches after point:	word (</br>
					^^^^ ^</br>
Where the match subexpressions are:	  1  2</br>
</br>
The item is delimited by (match-beginning 1) and (match-end 1).</br>
If (match-beginning 2) is non-nil, the item is followed by a `('.</br>
</br>
This function could be MATCHER in a MATCH-ANCHORED `font-lock-keywords' item.
