font-lock-remove-keywords is a compiled Lisp function in `font-lock.el'.<br/><br/>(font-lock-remove-keywords MODE KEYWORDS)<br/><br/>Remove highlighting KEYWORDS for MODE.<br/><br/>MODE should be a symbol, the major mode command name, such as `c-mode'<br/>or nil.  If nil, highlighting keywords are removed for the current buffer.<br/><br/>To make the removal apply to modes derived from MODE as well,<br/>pass nil for MODE and add the call to MODE-hook.  This may fail<br/>for some derived modes if some involved major mode does not<br/>follow the standard conventions.  File a bug report if this<br/>happens, so the major mode can be corrected.
