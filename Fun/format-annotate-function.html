<strong>format-annotate-function</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>format.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(format-annotate-function FORMAT FROM TO ORIG-BUF FORMAT-COUNT)<br/>
<br/>
Return annotations for writing region as FORMAT.<br/>
FORMAT is a symbol naming one of the formats defined in `format-alist'.<br/>
It must be a single symbol, not a list like `buffer-file-format'.<br/>
FROM and TO delimit the region to be operated on in the current buffer.<br/>
ORIG-BUF is the original buffer that the data came from.<br/>
<br/>
FORMAT-COUNT is an integer specifying how many times this function has<br/>
been called in the process of decoding ORIG-BUF.<br/>
<br/>
This function works like a function in `write-region-annotate-functions':<br/>
it either returns a list of annotations, or returns with a different buffer<br/>
current, which contains the modified text to write.  In the latter case,<br/>
this function's value is nil.<br/>
<br/>
For most purposes, consider using `format-encode-region' instead.
