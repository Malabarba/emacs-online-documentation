<strong>format-annotate-location</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>format.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(format-annotate-location LOC ALL IGNORE TRANSLATIONS)<br/>
<br/>
Return annotation(s) needed at location LOC.<br/>
This includes any properties that change between LOC - 1 and LOC.<br/>
If ALL is true, don't look at previous location, but generate annotations for<br/>
all non-nil properties.<br/>
Third argument IGNORE is a list of text-properties not to consider.<br/>
Use the TRANSLATIONS alist (see `format-annotate-region' for doc).<br/>
<br/>
Return value is a vector of 3 elements:<br/>
1. List of annotations to close<br/>
2. List of annotations to open.<br/>
3. List of properties that were ignored or couldn't be annotated.<br/>
<br/>
The annotations in lists 1 and 2 need not be strings.<br/>
They can be whatever the FORMAT-FN in `format-annotate-region'<br/>
can handle.  If that is `enriched-make-annotation', they can be<br/>
either strings, or lists of the form (PARAMETER VALUE).
