format-annotate-region is a compiled Lisp function in `format.el'.<br/><br/>(format-annotate-region FROM TO TRANSLATIONS FORMAT-FN IGNORE)<br/><br/>Generate annotations for text properties in the region.<br/>Search for changes between FROM and TO, and describe them with a list of<br/>annotations as defined by alist TRANSLATIONS and FORMAT-FN.  IGNORE lists text<br/>properties not to consider; any text properties that are neither ignored nor<br/>listed in TRANSLATIONS are warned about.<br/>If you actually want to modify the region, give the return value of this<br/>function to `format-insert-annotations'.<br/><br/>Format of the TRANSLATIONS argument:<br/><br/>Each element is a list whose car is a PROPERTY, and the following<br/>elements have the form (VALUE ANNOTATIONS...).<br/>Whenever the property takes on the value VALUE, the annotations<br/>(as formatted by FORMAT-FN) are inserted into the file.<br/>When the property stops having that value, the matching negated annotation<br/>will be inserted (it may actually be closed earlier and reopened, if<br/>necessary, to keep proper nesting).<br/><br/>If VALUE is a list, then each element of the list is dealt with<br/>separately.<br/><br/>If a VALUE is numeric, then it is assumed that there is a single annotation<br/>and each occurrence of it increments the value of the property by that number.<br/>Thus, given the entry (left-margin (4 "indent")), if the left margin<br/>changes from 4 to 12, two <indent> annotations will be generated.<br/><br/>If the VALUE is nil, then instead of annotations, a function should be<br/>specified.  This function is used as a default: it is called for all<br/>transitions not explicitly listed in the table.  The function is called with<br/>two arguments, the OLD and NEW values of the property.  It should return<br/>a cons cell (CLOSE . OPEN) as `format-annotate-single-property-change' does.<br/><br/>The same TRANSLATIONS structure can be used in reverse for reading files.
