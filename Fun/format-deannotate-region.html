<strong>format-deannotate-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>format.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(format-deannotate-region <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u> <u>TRANSLATIONS</u> <u>NEXT-FN</u>)</br>
</br>
Translate annotations in the region into text properties.</br>
This sets text properties between <u>FROM</u> to <u>TO</u> as directed by the</br>
<u>TRANSLATIONS</u> and <u>NEXT-FN</u> arguments.</br>
</br>
<u>NEXT-FN</u> is a function that searches forward from point for an annotation.</br>
It should return a list of 4 elements: (BEGIN END NAME POSITIVE).  BEGIN and</br>
END are buffer positions bounding the annotation, NAME is the name searched</br>
for in <u>TRANSLATIONS</u>, and POSITIVE should be non-nil if this annotation marks</br>
the beginning of a region with some property, or nil if it ends the region.</br>
<u>NEXT-FN</u> should return nil if there are no annotations after point.</br>
</br>
The basic format of the <u>TRANSLATIONS</u> argument is described in the</br>
documentation for the `format-annotate-region' function.  There are some</br>
additional things to keep in mind for decoding, though:</br>
</br>
When an annotation is found, the <u>TRANSLATIONS</u> list is searched for a</br>
text-property name and value that corresponds to that annotation.  If the</br>
text-property has several annotations associated with it, it will be used only</br>
if the other annotations are also in effect at that point.  The first match</br>
found whose annotations are all present is used.</br>
</br>
The text property thus determined is set to the value over the region between</br>
the opening and closing annotations.  However, if the text-property name has a</br>
non-nil `format-list-valued' property, then the value will be consed onto the</br>
surrounding value of the property, rather than replacing that value.</br>
</br>
There are some special symbols that can be used in the "property" slot of</br>
the <u>TRANSLATIONS</u> list: PARAMETER and FUNCTION (spelled in uppercase).</br>
Annotations listed under the pseudo-property PARAMETER are considered to be</br>
arguments of the immediately surrounding annotation; the text between the</br>
opening and closing parameter annotations is deleted from the buffer but saved</br>
as a string.</br>
</br>
The surrounding annotation should be listed under the pseudo-property</br>
FUNCTION.  Instead of inserting a text-property for this annotation,</br>
the function listed in the VALUE slot is called to make whatever</br>
changes are appropriate.  It can also return a list of the form</br>
(START LOC PROP VALUE) which specifies a property to put on.  The</br>
function's first two arguments are the START and END locations, and</br>
the rest of the arguments are any PARAMETERs found in that region.</br>
</br>
Any annotations that are found by <u>NEXT-FN</u> but not defined by <u>TRANSLATIONS</u></br>
are saved as values of the `unknown' text-property (which is list-valued).</br>
The <u>TRANSLATIONS</u> list should usually contain an entry of the form</br>
    (unknown (nil format-annotate-value))</br>
to write these unknown annotations back into the file.
