format-deannotate-region is a compiled Lisp function in `format.el'.<br/><br/>(format-deannotate-region FROM TO TRANSLATIONS NEXT-FN)<br/><br/>Translate annotations in the region into text properties.<br/>This sets text properties between FROM to TO as directed by the<br/>TRANSLATIONS and NEXT-FN arguments.<br/><br/>NEXT-FN is a function that searches forward from point for an annotation.<br/>It should return a list of 4 elements: (BEGIN END NAME POSITIVE).  BEGIN and<br/>END are buffer positions bounding the annotation, NAME is the name searched<br/>for in TRANSLATIONS, and POSITIVE should be non-nil if this annotation marks<br/>the beginning of a region with some property, or nil if it ends the region.<br/>NEXT-FN should return nil if there are no annotations after point.<br/><br/>The basic format of the TRANSLATIONS argument is described in the<br/>documentation for the `format-annotate-region' function.  There are some<br/>additional things to keep in mind for decoding, though:<br/><br/>When an annotation is found, the TRANSLATIONS list is searched for a<br/>text-property name and value that corresponds to that annotation.  If the<br/>text-property has several annotations associated with it, it will be used only<br/>if the other annotations are also in effect at that point.  The first match<br/>found whose annotations are all present is used.<br/><br/>The text property thus determined is set to the value over the region between<br/>the opening and closing annotations.  However, if the text-property name has a<br/>non-nil `format-list-valued' property, then the value will be consed onto the<br/>surrounding value of the property, rather than replacing that value.<br/><br/>There are some special symbols that can be used in the "property" slot of<br/>the TRANSLATIONS list: PARAMETER and FUNCTION (spelled in uppercase).<br/>Annotations listed under the pseudo-property PARAMETER are considered to be<br/>arguments of the immediately surrounding annotation; the text between the<br/>opening and closing parameter annotations is deleted from the buffer but saved<br/>as a string.<br/><br/>The surrounding annotation should be listed under the pseudo-property<br/>FUNCTION.  Instead of inserting a text-property for this annotation,<br/>the function listed in the VALUE slot is called to make whatever<br/>changes are appropriate.  It can also return a list of the form<br/>(START LOC PROP VALUE) which specifies a property to put on.  The<br/>function's first two arguments are the START and END locations, and<br/>the rest of the arguments are any PARAMETERs found in that region.<br/><br/>Any annotations that are found by NEXT-FN but not defined by TRANSLATIONS<br/>are saved as values of the `unknown' text-property (which is list-valued).<br/>The TRANSLATIONS list should usually contain an entry of the form<br/>    (unknown (nil format-annotate-value))<br/>to write these unknown annotations back into the file.
