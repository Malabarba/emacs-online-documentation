<strong>format-subtract-regions</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>format.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(format-subtract-regions <u>MINUEND</u> <u>SUBTRAHEND</u>)</br>
</br>
Remove from the regions in <u>MINUEND</u> the regions in <u>SUBTRAHEND</u>.</br>
A region is a dotted pair (FROM . TO).  Both parameters are lists of</br>
regions.  Each list must contain nonoverlapping, noncontiguous</br>
regions, in descending order.  The result is also nonoverlapping,</br>
noncontiguous, and in descending order.  The first element of <u>MINUEND</u></br>
can have a cdr of nil, indicating that the end of that region is not</br>
yet known.
