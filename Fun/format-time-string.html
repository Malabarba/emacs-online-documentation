Certain flags and modifiers are available with some format controls.</br>
The flags are `_', `-', `^' and `#'.  For certain characters X,</br>
%_X is like %X, but padded with blanks; %-X is like %X,</br>
but without padding.  %^X is like %X, but with all textual</br>
characters up-cased; %#X is like %X, but with letter-case of</br>
all textual characters reversed.</br>
%NX (where N stands for an integer) is like %X,</br>
but takes up at least N (a number) positions.</br>
The modifiers are `E' and `O'.  For certain characters X,</br>
%EX is a locale's alternative version of %X;</br>
%OX is like %X, but uses the locale's number symbols.</br>

For example, to produce full ISO 8601 format, use "%FT%T%z".<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
