<strong>fortran-indent-new-line</strong> is an alias for `reindent-then-newline-and-indent' in `<code>fortran.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(fortran-indent-new-line)<br/>
<br/>
Reindent current line, insert newline, then indent the new line.<br/>
Indentation of both lines is done according to the current major mode,<br/>
which means calling the current value of `indent-line-function'.<br/>
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.<br/>
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this indents to the<br/>
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.
