</br>
Move <u>N</u> lines forward (backward if <u>N</u> is negative).</br>
Precisely, if point is on line I, move to the start of line I + <u>N</u></br>
("start of line" in the logical order).</br>
If there isn't room, go as far as possible (no error).</br>
Returns the count of lines left to move.  If moving forward,</br>
that is <u>N</u> - number of lines moved; if backward, <u>N</u> + number moved.</br>
With positive <u>N</u>, a non-empty line at the end counts as one line</br>
