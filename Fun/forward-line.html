forward-line is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(forward-line &optional N)<br/><br/>Move N lines forward (backward if N is negative).<br/>Precisely, if point is on line I, move to the start of line I + N<br/>("start of line" in the logical order).<br/>If there isn't room, go as far as possible (no error).<br/>Returns the count of lines left to move.  If moving forward,<br/>that is N - number of lines moved; if backward, N + number moved.<br/>With positive N, a non-empty line at the end counts as one line<br/>successfully moved (for the return value).
