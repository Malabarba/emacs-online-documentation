<strong>frame-height</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>frame.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(frame-height &optional <u>FRAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return number of lines available for display on <u>FRAME</u>.</br>
If <u>FRAME</u> is omitted, describe the currently selected frame.</br>
Exactly what is included in the return value depends on the</br>
window-system and toolkit in use - see `frame-pixel-height' for</br>
more details.  The lines are in units of the default font height.</br>
</br>
The result is roughly related to the frame pixel height via</br>
height in pixels = height in lines * `frame-char-height'.</br>
However, this is only approximate, and is complicated e.g. by the</br>
fact that individual window lines and menu bar lines can have</br>
differing font heights.
