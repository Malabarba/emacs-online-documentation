frame-or-buffer-changed-p is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(frame-or-buffer-changed-p &optional VARIABLE)<br/><br/>Return non-nil if the frame and buffer state appears to have changed.<br/>VARIABLE is a variable name whose value is either nil or a state vector<br/>that will be updated to contain all frames and buffers,<br/>aside from buffers whose names start with space,<br/>along with the buffers' read-only and modified flags.  This allows a fast<br/>check to see whether buffer menus might need to be recomputed.<br/>If this function returns non-nil, it updates the internal vector to reflect<br/>the current state.<br/><br/>If VARIABLE is nil, an internal variable is used.  Users should not<br/>pass nil for VARIABLE.
