frame-pixel-height is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(frame-pixel-height &optional FRAME)<br/><br/>Return a FRAME's height in pixels.<br/>If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.  The exact value<br/>of the result depends on the window-system and toolkit in use:<br/><br/>In the Gtk+ version of Emacs, it includes only any window (including<br/>the minibuffer or echo area), mode line, and header line.  It does not<br/>include the tool bar or menu bar.<br/><br/>With other graphical versions, it also includes the tool bar and the<br/>menu bar.<br/><br/>For a text terminal, it includes the menu bar.  In this case, the<br/>result is really in characters rather than pixels (i.e., is identical<br/>to `frame-height').
