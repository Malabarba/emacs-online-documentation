<strong>frame-pixel-height</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(frame-pixel-height &optional <u>FRAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a <u>FRAME</u>'s height in pixels.</br>
If <u>FRAME</u> is omitted or nil, the selected frame is used.  The exact value</br>
of the result depends on the window-system and toolkit in use:</br>
</br>
In the Gtk+ version of Emacs, it includes only any window (including</br>
the minibuffer or echo area), mode line, and header line.  It does not</br>
include the tool bar or menu bar.</br>
</br>
With other graphical versions, it also includes the tool bar and the</br>
menu bar.</br>
</br>
For a text terminal, it includes the menu bar.  In this case, the</br>
result is really in characters rather than pixels (i.e., is identical</br>
to `frame-height').
