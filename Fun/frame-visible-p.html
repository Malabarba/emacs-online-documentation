<strong>frame-visible-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(frame-visible-p FRAME)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if FRAME is "visible" (actually in use for display).<br/>
Return the symbol `icon' if FRAME is iconified or "minimized".<br/>
Return nil if FRAME was made invisible, via `make-frame-invisible'.<br/>
On graphical displays, invisible frames are not updated and are<br/>
usually not displayed at all, even in a window system's "taskbar".<br/>
<br/>
If FRAME is a text terminal frame, this always returns t.<br/>
Such frames are always considered visible, whether or not they are<br/>
currently being displayed on the terminal.
