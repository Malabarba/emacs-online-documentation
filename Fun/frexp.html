frexp is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(frexp X)<br/><br/>Get significand and exponent of a floating point number.<br/>Breaks the floating point number X into its binary significand SGNFCAND<br/>(a floating point value between 0.5 (included) and 1.0 (excluded))<br/>and an integral exponent EXP for 2, such that:<br/><br/>  X = SGNFCAND * 2^EXP<br/><br/>The function returns the cons cell (SGNFCAND . EXP).<br/>If X is zero, both parts (SGNFCAND and EXP) are zero.
