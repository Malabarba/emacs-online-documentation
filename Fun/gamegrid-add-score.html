<strong>gamegrid-add-score</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>gamegrid.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gamegrid-add-score <u>FILE</u> <u>SCORE</u>)</br>
</br>
Add the current score to the high score file.</br>
</br>
On POSIX systems there may be a shared game directory for all users in</br>
which the scorefiles are kept.  On such systems Emacs doesn't create</br>
the score file <u>FILE</u> in this directory, if it doesn't already exist.</br>
In this case Emacs searches for <u>FILE</u> in the directory specified by</br>
`gamegrid-user-score-file-directory' and creates it there, if</br>
necessary.</br>
</br>
To add the score file for a game to the system wide shared game</br>
directory, create the file with the shell command "touch" in this</br>
directory and make sure that it is owned by the correct user and</br>
group.  You probably need special user privileges to do this.</br>
</br>
On non-POSIX systems Emacs searches for <u>FILE</u> in the directory</br>
specified by the variable `temporary-file-directory'.  If necessary,</br>
<u>FILE</u> is created there.
