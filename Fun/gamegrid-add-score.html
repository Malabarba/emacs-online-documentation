gamegrid-add-score is a compiled Lisp function in `gamegrid.el'.<br/><br/>(gamegrid-add-score FILE SCORE)<br/><br/>Add the current score to the high score file.<br/><br/>On POSIX systems there may be a shared game directory for all users in<br/>which the scorefiles are kept.  On such systems Emacs doesn't create<br/>the score file FILE in this directory, if it doesn't already exist.<br/>In this case Emacs searches for FILE in the directory specified by<br/>`gamegrid-user-score-file-directory' and creates it there, if<br/>necessary.<br/><br/>To add the score file for a game to the system wide shared game<br/>directory, create the file with the shell command "touch" in this<br/>directory and make sure that it is owned by the correct user and<br/>group.  You probably need special user privileges to do this.<br/><br/>On non-POSIX systems Emacs searches for FILE in the directory<br/>specified by the variable `temporary-file-directory'.  If necessary,<br/>FILE is created there.
