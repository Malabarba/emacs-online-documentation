<strong>gametree-break-line-here</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>gametree.el</code>'.<br/>

<br/>
Split the variation node at the point position.<br/>
This command works whether the current variation node is a leaf, or is<br/>
already branching at its end.  The new node is created at a level that<br/>
reflects the number of game plys between the beginning of the current<br/>
variation and the breaking point.<br/>
<br/>
With a numerical argument AT-MOVE, split the variation before<br/>
White's AT-MOVEth move, or Black's if negative.  The last option will<br/>
only work of Black's moves are explicitly numbered, for instance<br/>
`1. e4 1: e5'.
