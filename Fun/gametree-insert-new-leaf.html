<strong>gametree-insert-new-leaf</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>gametree.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(gametree-insert-new-leaf &optional <u>AT-DEPTH</u>)</br>
</br>
Start a new leaf variation under the current branching point.</br>
The new variation can later be split to be a branching point itself,</br>
with M-x gametree-break-line-here.  If the point is currently on a</br>
leaf variation, this command won't work; use M-x gametree-break-line-here</br>
on the current line first.</br>
</br>
With a numeric arg <u>AT-DEPTH</u>, first go up the tree until a node of</br>
depth <u>AT-DEPTH</u> or smaller is found.
