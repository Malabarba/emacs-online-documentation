<strong>gametree-insert-new-leaf</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>gametree.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gametree-insert-new-leaf &optional AT-DEPTH)<br/>
<br/>
Start a new leaf variation under the current branching point.<br/>
The new variation can later be split to be a branching point itself,<br/>
with M-x gametree-break-line-here.  If the point is currently on a<br/>
leaf variation, this command won't work; use M-x gametree-break-line-here<br/>
on the current line first.<br/>
<br/>
With a numeric arg AT-DEPTH, first go up the tree until a node of<br/>
depth AT-DEPTH or smaller is found.
