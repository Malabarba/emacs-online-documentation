<strong>garbage-collect</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(garbage-collect)</br>
</br>
Reclaim storage for Lisp objects no longer needed.</br>
Garbage collection happens automatically if you cons more than</br>
`gc-cons-threshold' bytes of Lisp data since previous garbage collection.</br>
`garbage-collect' normally returns a list with info on amount of space in use,</br>
where each entry has the form (NAME SIZE USED FREE), where:</br>
- NAME is a symbol describing the kind of objects this entry represents,</br>
- SIZE is the number of bytes used by each one,</br>
- USED is the number of those objects that were found live in the heap,</br>
- FREE is the number of those objects that are not live but that Emacs</br>
  keeps around for future allocations (maybe because it does not know how</br>
  to return them to the OS).</br>
However, if there was overflow in pure space, `garbage-collect'</br>
returns nil, because real GC can't be done.</br>
See Info node `(elisp)Garbage Collection'.
