Toggle logging of transaction between Emacs and Gdb.</br>
The log is stored in `gdb-debug-log' as an alist with elements</br>
whose cons is send, send-item or recv and whose cdr is the string</br>
being transferred.  This list may grow up to a size of</br>
`gdb-debug-log-max' after which the oldest element (at the end of</br>
the list) is deleted every time a new one is added (at the front).
