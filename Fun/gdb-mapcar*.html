<strong>gdb-mapcar*</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>gdb-mi.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gdb-mapcar* FUNCTION &rest SEQS)<br/>
<br/>
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQS, and make a list of the results.<br/>
If there are several SEQS, FUNCTION is called with that many<br/>
arguments, and mapping stops as soon as the shortest list runs<br/>
out.
