<strong>gdb-remove-all-pending-triggers</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>gdb-mi.el</code>'.</br>

(gdb-remove-all-pending-triggers)</br>
</br>
Remove all pending triggers from gdb-handler-list.</br>
The handlers are left in gdb-handler-list so that replies received</br>
from GDB could still be handled.  However, removing the pending triggers</br>
allows Emacs to send new commands even if replies of previous commands</br>
were not yet received.
