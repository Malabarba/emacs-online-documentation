<strong>gdbmi-bnf-result-and-async-record-impl</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>gdb-mi.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gdbmi-bnf-result-and-async-record-impl)</br>
</br>
Common implementation of the result-record and async-record rule.</br>
Both rules share the same syntax.  Those records may be very large in size.</br>
For that reason, the "result" part of the  record is parsed by</br>
`gdbmi-bnf-incomplete-record-result', which will keep</br>
receiving characters as they arrive from GDB until the record is complete.
