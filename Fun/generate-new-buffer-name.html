<strong>generate-new-buffer-name</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(generate-new-buffer-name NAME &optional IGNORE)<br/>
<br/>
Return a string that is the name of no existing buffer based on NAME.<br/>
If there is no live buffer named NAME, then return NAME.<br/>
Otherwise modify name by appending `<NUMBER>', incrementing NUMBER<br/>
(starting at 2) until an unused name is found, and then return that name.<br/>
Optional second argument IGNORE specifies a name that is okay to use (if<br/>
it is in the sequence to be tried) even if a buffer with that name exists.<br/>
<br/>
If NAME begins with a space (i.e., a buffer that is not normally<br/>
visible to users), then if buffer NAME already exists a random number<br/>
is first appended to NAME, to speed up finding a non-existent buffer.
