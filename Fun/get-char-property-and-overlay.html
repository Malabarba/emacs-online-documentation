get-char-property-and-overlay is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(get-char-property-and-overlay POSITION PROP &optional OBJECT)<br/><br/>Like `get-char-property', but with extra overlay information.<br/>The value is a cons cell.  Its car is the return value of `get-char-property'<br/>with the same arguments--that is, the value of POSITION's property<br/>PROP in OBJECT.  Its cdr is the overlay in which the property was<br/>found, or nil, if it was found as a text property or not found at all.<br/><br/>OBJECT is optional and defaults to the current buffer.  OBJECT may be<br/>a string, a buffer or a window.  For strings, the cdr of the return<br/>value is always nil, since strings do not have overlays.  If OBJECT is<br/>a window, then that window's buffer is used, but window-specific<br/>overlays are considered only if they are associated with OBJECT.  If<br/>POSITION is at the end of OBJECT, both car and cdr are nil.
