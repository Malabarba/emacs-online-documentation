<strong>get-char-property-and-overlay</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(get-char-property-and-overlay <u>POSITION</u> <u>PROP</u> &optional <u>OBJECT</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `get-char-property', but with extra overlay information.</br>
The value is a cons cell.  Its car is the return value of `get-char-property'</br>
with the same arguments--that is, the value of <u>POSITION</u>'s property</br>
<u>PROP</u> in <u>OBJECT</u>.  Its cdr is the overlay in which the property was</br>
found, or nil, if it was found as a text property or not found at all.</br>
</br>
<u>OBJECT</u> is optional and defaults to the current buffer.  <u>OBJECT</u> may be</br>
a string, a buffer or a window.  For strings, the cdr of the return</br>
value is always nil, since strings do not have overlays.  If <u>OBJECT</u> is</br>
a window, then that window's buffer is used, but window-specific</br>
overlays are considered only if they are associated with <u>OBJECT</u>.  If</br>
<u>POSITION</u> is at the end of <u>OBJECT</u>, both car and cdr are nil.
