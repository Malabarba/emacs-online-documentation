<strong>get-pos-property</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(get-pos-property <u>POSITION</u> <u>PROP</u> &optional <u>OBJECT</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the value of <u>POSITION</u>'s property <u>PROP</u>, in <u>OBJECT</u>.</br>
Almost identical to `get-char-property' except for the following difference:</br>
Whereas `get-char-property' returns the property of the char at (i.e. right</br>
after) <u>POSITION</u>, this pays attention to properties's stickiness and overlays's</br>
advancement settings, in order to find the property of <u>POSITION</u> itself,</br>
i.e. the property that a char would inherit if it were inserted</br>
at <u>POSITION</u>.
