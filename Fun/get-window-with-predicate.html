get-window-with-predicate is a compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(get-window-with-predicate PREDICATE &optional MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES DEFAULT)<br/><br/>Return a live window satisfying PREDICATE.<br/>More precisely, cycle through all windows calling the function<br/>PREDICATE on each one of them with the window as its sole<br/>argument.  Return the first window for which PREDICATE returns<br/>non-nil.  Windows are scanned starting with the window following<br/>the selected window.  If no window satisfies PREDICATE, return<br/>DEFAULT.<br/><br/>MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the<br/>minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include<br/>the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any<br/>other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if<br/>the minibuffer is active.<br/><br/>ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the selected<br/>frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF<br/>argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all<br/>frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following non-nil<br/>values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:<br/><br/>- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.<br/><br/>- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on<br/>  the current terminal.<br/><br/>- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible<br/>  and iconified frames on the current terminal.<br/><br/>- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.<br/><br/>Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame<br/>and no others.
