gmm-image-load-path-for-library is an alias for `image-load-path-for-library' in `gmm-utils.el'.<br/><br/>(gmm-image-load-path-for-library LIBRARY IMAGE &optional PATH NO-ERROR)<br/><br/>Return a suitable search path for images used by LIBRARY.<br/><br/>It searches for IMAGE in `image-load-path' (excluding<br/>"`data-directory'/images") and `load-path', followed by a path<br/>suitable for LIBRARY, which includes "../../etc/images" and<br/>"../etc/images" relative to the library file itself, and then<br/>in "`data-directory'/images".<br/><br/>Then this function returns a list of directories which contains<br/>first the directory in which IMAGE was found, followed by the<br/>value of `load-path'.  If PATH is given, it is used instead of<br/>`load-path'.<br/><br/>If NO-ERROR is non-nil and a suitable path can't be found, don't<br/>signal an error.  Instead, return a list of directories as before,<br/>except that nil appears in place of the image directory.<br/><br/>Here is an example that uses a common idiom to provide<br/>compatibility with versions of Emacs that lack the variable<br/>`image-load-path':<br/><br/>    ;; Shush compiler.<br/>    (defvar image-load-path)<br/><br/>    (let* ((load-path (image-load-path-for-library "mh-e" "mh-logo.xpm"))<br/>           (image-load-path (cons (car load-path)<br/>                                  (when (boundp 'image-load-path)<br/>                                    image-load-path))))<br/>      (mh-tool-bar-folder-buttons-init))
