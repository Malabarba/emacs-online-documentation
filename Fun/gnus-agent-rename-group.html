<strong>gnus-agent-rename-group</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>gnus-agent.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gnus-agent-rename-group OLD-GROUP NEW-GROUP)<br/>
<br/>
Rename fully-qualified OLD-GROUP as NEW-GROUP.<br/>
Always updates the agent, even when disabled, as the old agent<br/>
files would corrupt gnus when the agent was next enabled.<br/>
Depends upon the caller to determine whether group renaming is<br/>
supported.
