<strong>gnus-atomic-progn-assign</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>gnus-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gnus-atomic-progn-assign PROTECT &rest FORMS)<br/>
<br/>
Evaluate FORMS, but ensure that the variables listed in PROTECT<br/>
are not changed if anything in FORMS signals an error or otherwise<br/>
non-locally exits.  The variables listed in PROTECT are updated atomically.<br/>
It is safe to use gnus-atomic-progn-assign with long computations.<br/>
<br/>
Note that if any of the symbols in PROTECT were unbound, they will be<br/>
set to nil on a successful assignment.  In case of an error or other<br/>
non-local exit, it will still be unbound.
