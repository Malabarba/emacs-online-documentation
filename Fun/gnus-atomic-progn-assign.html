<strong>gnus-atomic-progn-assign</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>gnus-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gnus-atomic-progn-assign <u>PROTECT</u> &rest <u>FORMS</u>)</br>
</br>
Evaluate <u>FORMS</u>, but ensure that the variables listed in <u>PROTECT</u></br>
are not changed if anything in <u>FORMS</u> signals an error or otherwise</br>
non-locally exits.  The variables listed in <u>PROTECT</u> are updated atomically.</br>
It is safe to use gnus-atomic-progn-assign with long computations.</br>
</br>
Note that if any of the symbols in <u>PROTECT</u> were unbound, they will be</br>
set to nil on a successful assignment.  In case of an error or other</br>
non-local exit, it will still be unbound.
