<strong>gnus-atomic-progn</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>gnus-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gnus-atomic-progn &rest <u>FORMS</u>)</br>
</br>
Evaluate <u>FORMS</u> atomically, which means to protect the evaluation</br>
from being interrupted by the user.  An error from the forms themselves</br>
will return without finishing the operation.  Since interrupts from</br>
the user are disabled, it is recommended that only the most minimal</br>
operations are performed by <u>FORMS</u>.  If you wish to assign many</br>
complicated values atomically, compute the results into temporary</br>
variables and then do only the assignment atomically.
