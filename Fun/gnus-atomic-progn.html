gnus-atomic-progn is a Lisp macro in `gnus-util.el'.<br/><br/>(gnus-atomic-progn &rest FORMS)<br/><br/>Evaluate FORMS atomically, which means to protect the evaluation<br/>from being interrupted by the user.  An error from the forms themselves<br/>will return without finishing the operation.  Since interrupts from<br/>the user are disabled, it is recommended that only the most minimal<br/>operations are performed by FORMS.  If you wish to assign many<br/>complicated values atomically, compute the results into temporary<br/>variables and then do only the assignment atomically.
