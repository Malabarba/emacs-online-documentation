<strong>gnus-atomic-setq</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>gnus-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gnus-atomic-setq &rest <u>PAIRS</u>)</br>
</br>
Similar to setq, except that the real symbols are only assigned when</br>
there are no errors.  And when the real symbols are assigned, they are</br>
done so atomically.  If other variables might be changed via side-effect,</br>
see gnus-atomic-progn-assign.  It is safe to use gnus-atomic-setq</br>
with potentially long computations.
