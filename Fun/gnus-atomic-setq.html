gnus-atomic-setq is a Lisp macro in `gnus-util.el'.<br/><br/>(gnus-atomic-setq &rest PAIRS)<br/><br/>Similar to setq, except that the real symbols are only assigned when<br/>there are no errors.  And when the real symbols are assigned, they are<br/>done so atomically.  If other variables might be changed via side-effect,<br/>see gnus-atomic-progn-assign.  It is safe to use gnus-atomic-setq<br/>with potentially long computations.
