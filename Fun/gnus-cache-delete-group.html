<strong>gnus-cache-delete-group</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>gnus-cache.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gnus-cache-delete-group GROUP)<br/>
<br/>
Delete GROUP from the cache.<br/>
Always updates the cache, even when disabled, as the old cache<br/>
files would corrupt gnus when the cache was next enabled.<br/>
Depends upon the caller to determine whether group deletion is<br/>
supported.
