<strong>gnus-mapcar</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>gnus-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gnus-mapcar <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>SEQ1</u> &rest <u>SEQS2_N</u>)</br>
</br>
Apply <u>FUNCTION</u> to each element of the sequences, and make a list of the results.</br>
If there are several sequences, <u>FUNCTION</u> is called with that many arguments,</br>
and mapping stops as soon as the shortest sequence runs out.  With just one</br>
sequence, this is like `mapcar'.  With several, it is like the Common Lisp</br>
`mapcar' function extended to arbitrary sequence types.
