gnus-mapcar is a Lisp macro in `gnus-util.el'.<br/><br/>(gnus-mapcar FUNCTION SEQ1 &rest SEQS2_N)<br/><br/>Apply FUNCTION to each element of the sequences, and make a list of the results.<br/>If there are several sequences, FUNCTION is called with that many arguments,<br/>and mapping stops as soon as the shortest sequence runs out.  With just one<br/>sequence, this is like `mapcar'.  With several, it is like the Common Lisp<br/>`mapcar' function extended to arbitrary sequence types.
