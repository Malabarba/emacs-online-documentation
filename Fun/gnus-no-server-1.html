If ARG is a positive number, Gnus will use that as the startup<br/>
level.  If ARG is nil, Gnus will be started at level 2<br/>
(`gnus-level-default-subscribed' minus one).  If ARG is non-nil<br/>
and not a positive number, Gnus will prompt the user for the name<br/>
of an NNTP server to use.  As opposed to M-x gnus, this command<br/>
will not connect to the local server.
