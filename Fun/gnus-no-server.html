<strong>gnus-no-server</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>gnus.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Read network news.<br/>
If ARG is a positive number, Gnus will use that as the startup<br/>
level. If ARG is nil, Gnus will be started at level 2.  If ARG is<br/>
non-nil and not a positive number, Gnus will prompt the user for the<br/>
name of an NNTP server to use.<br/>
As opposed to `gnus', this command will not connect to the local<br/>
server.
