gnus-remassoc is a compiled Lisp function in `gnus-util.el'.<br/><br/>(gnus-remassoc KEY ALIST)<br/><br/>Delete by side effect any elements of LIST whose car is `equal' to KEY.<br/>The modified LIST is returned.  If the first member<br/>of LIST has a car that is `equal' to KEY, there is no way to remove it<br/>by side effect; therefore, write `(setq foo (gnus-remassoc key foo))' to be<br/>sure of changing the value of `foo'.
