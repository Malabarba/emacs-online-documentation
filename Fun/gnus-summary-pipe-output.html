gnus-summary-pipe-output is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `gnus-sum.el'.<br/><br/>(gnus-summary-pipe-output &optional N SYM)<br/><br/>Pipe the current article to a subprocess.<br/>If N is a positive number, pipe the N next articles.<br/>If N is a negative number, pipe the N previous articles.<br/>If N is nil and any articles have been marked with the process mark,<br/>pipe those articles instead.<br/>The default command to which articles are piped is specified by the<br/>variable `gnus-summary-pipe-output-default-command'; if it is nil, you<br/>will be prompted for the command.<br/><br/>The properties `:decode' and `:headers' that are put to the function<br/>symbol `gnus-summary-save-in-pipe' control whether this function<br/>decodes articles and what headers to keep (see the doc string for the<br/>`gnus-default-article-saver' variable).  If SYM (the symbolic prefix)<br/>is neither omitted nor the symbol `r', force including all headers<br/>regardless of the `:headers' property.  If it is the symbol `r',<br/>articles that are not decoded and include all headers will be piped<br/>no matter what the properties `:decode' and `:headers' are.
