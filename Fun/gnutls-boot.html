<strong>gnutls-boot</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gnutls-boot PROC TYPE PROPLIST)<br/>
<br/>
Initialize GnuTLS client for process PROC with TYPE+PROPLIST.<br/>
Currently only client mode is supported.  Return a success/failure<br/>
value you can check with `gnutls-errorp'.<br/>
<br/>
TYPE is a symbol, either `gnutls-anon' or `gnutls-x509pki'.<br/>
PROPLIST is a property list with the following keys:<br/>
<br/>
:hostname is a string naming the remote host.<br/>
<br/>
:priority is a GnuTLS priority string, defaults to "NORMAL".<br/>
<br/>
:trustfiles is a list of PEM-encoded trust files for `gnutls-x509pki'.<br/>
<br/>
:crlfiles is a list of PEM-encoded CRL lists for `gnutls-x509pki'.<br/>
<br/>
:keylist is an alist of PEM-encoded key files and PEM-encoded<br/>
certificates for `gnutls-x509pki'.<br/>
<br/>
:callbacks is an alist of callback functions, see below.<br/>
<br/>
:loglevel is the debug level requested from GnuTLS, try 4.<br/>
<br/>
:verify-flags is a bitset as per GnuTLS'<br/>
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags.<br/>
<br/>
:verify-hostname-error, if non-nil, makes a hostname mismatch an<br/>
error.  Otherwise it will be just a warning.<br/>
<br/>
:min-prime-bits is the minimum accepted number of bits the client will<br/>
accept in Diffie-Hellman key exchange.<br/>
<br/>
The debug level will be set for this process AND globally for GnuTLS.<br/>
So if you set it higher or lower at any point, it affects global<br/>
debugging.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the priority is set on the client.  The server does not use<br/>
the protocols's priority except for disabling protocols that were not<br/>
specified.<br/>
<br/>
Processes must be initialized with this function before other GnuTLS<br/>
functions are used.  This function allocates resources which can only<br/>
be deallocated by calling `gnutls-deinit' or by calling it again.<br/>
<br/>
The callbacks alist can have a `verify' key, associated with a<br/>
verification function (UNUSED).<br/>
<br/>
Each authentication type may need additional information in order to<br/>
work.  For X.509 PKI (`gnutls-x509pki'), you probably need at least<br/>
one trustfile (usually a CA bundle).
