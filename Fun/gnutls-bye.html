<strong>gnutls-bye</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gnutls-bye <u>PROC</u> <u>CONT</u>)</br>
</br>
Terminate current GnuTLS connection for process <u>PROC</u>.</br>
The connection should have been initiated using `gnutls-handshake'.</br>
</br>
If <u>CONT</u> is not nil the TLS connection gets terminated and further</br>
receives and sends will be disallowed.  If the return value is zero you</br>
may continue using the connection.  If <u>CONT</u> is nil, GnuTLS actually</br>
sends an alert containing a close request and waits for the peer to</br>
reply with the same message.  In order to reuse the connection you</br>
should wait for an EOF from the peer.</br>
</br>
This function may also return `gnutls-e-again', or</br>
`gnutls-e-interrupted'.
