<br/>
Start a Gomoku game between you and Emacs.<br/>

You and Emacs play in turn by marking a free square.  You mark it with X<br/>
and Emacs marks it with O.  The winner is the first to get five contiguous<br/>
marks horizontally, vertically or in diagonal.<br/>
<br/>
You play by moving the cursor over the square you choose and hitting<br/>
RET.<br/>
<br/>
This program actually plays a simplified or archaic version of the<br/>
Gomoku game, and ought to be upgraded to use the full modern rules.<br/>
