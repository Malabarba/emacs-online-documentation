goto-line is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to M-g g, M-g M-g, <menu-bar> <edit> <goto> <go-to-line>.<br/><br/>(goto-line LINE &optional BUFFER)<br/><br/>Go to LINE, counting from line 1 at beginning of buffer.<br/>If called interactively, a numeric prefix argument specifies<br/>LINE; without a numeric prefix argument, read LINE from the<br/>minibuffer.<br/><br/>If optional argument BUFFER is non-nil, switch to that buffer and<br/>move to line LINE there.  If called interactively with C-u<br/>as argument, BUFFER is the most recently selected other buffer.<br/><br/>Prior to moving point, this function sets the mark (without<br/>activating it), unless Transient Mark mode is enabled and the<br/>mark is already active.<br/><br/>This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.<br/>What you probably want instead is something like:<br/>  (goto-char (point-min))<br/>  (forward-line (1- N))<br/>If at all possible, an even better solution is to use char counts<br/>rather than line counts.
