<strong>grep</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>grep.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <tools> <grep>.<br/>
<br/>
(grep COMMAND-ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Run grep, with user-specified args, and collect output in a buffer.<br/>
While grep runs asynchronously, you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error),<br/>
or RET in the *grep* buffer, to go to the lines where grep found<br/>
matches.  To kill the grep job before it finishes, type C-c C-k.<br/>
<br/>
For doing a recursive `grep', see the `rgrep' command.  For running<br/>
`grep' in a specific directory, see `lgrep'.<br/>
<br/>
This command uses a special history list for its COMMAND-ARGS, so you<br/>
can easily repeat a grep command.<br/>
<br/>
A prefix argument says to default the argument based upon the current<br/>
tag the cursor is over, substituting it into the last grep command<br/>
in the grep command history (or into `grep-command' if that history<br/>
list is empty).
