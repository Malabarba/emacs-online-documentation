<strong>gud-find-class</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>gud.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gud-find-class F LINE)<br/>
<br/>
Find fully qualified class in file F at line LINE.<br/>
This function uses the `gud-jdb-classpath' (and optional<br/>
`gud-jdb-sourcepath') list(s) to derive a file<br/>
pathname relative to its classpath directory.  The values in<br/>
`gud-jdb-classpath' are assumed to have been converted to absolute<br/>
pathname standards using file-truename.<br/>
If F is visited by a buffer and its mode is CC-mode(Java),<br/>
syntactic information of LINE is used to find the enclosing (nested)<br/>
class string which is appended to the top level<br/>
class of the file (using s to separate nested class ids).
