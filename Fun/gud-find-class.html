<strong>gud-find-class</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>gud.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gud-find-class <u>F</u> <u>LINE</u>)</br>
</br>
Find fully qualified class in file <u>F</u> at line <u>LINE</u>.</br>
This function uses the `gud-jdb-classpath' (and optional</br>
`gud-jdb-sourcepath') list(s) to derive a file</br>
pathname relative to its classpath directory.  The values in</br>
`gud-jdb-classpath' are assumed to have been converted to absolute</br>
pathname standards using file-truename.</br>
If <u>F</u> is visited by a buffer and its mode is CC-mode(Java),</br>
syntactic information of <u>LINE</u> is used to find the enclosing (nested)</br>
class string which is appended to the top level</br>
class of the file (using s to separate nested class ids).
