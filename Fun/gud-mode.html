</br>
</br>
(gud-mode)</br>
</br>
Parent mode: `comint-mode'.</br>
</br>
Major mode for interacting with an inferior debugger process.</br>
</br>
   You start it up with one of the commands M-x gdb, M-x sdb, M-x dbx,</br>
M-x perldb, M-x xdb, or M-x jdb.  Each entry point finishes by executing a</br>
hook; `gdb-mode-hook', `sdb-mode-hook', `dbx-mode-hook',</br>
`perldb-mode-hook', `xdb-mode-hook', or `jdb-mode-hook' respectively.</br>
</br>
After startup, the following commands are available in both the GUD</br>
interaction buffer and any source buffer GUD visits due to a breakpoint stop</br>
or step operation:</br>
</br>
M-x gud-break sets a breakpoint at the current file and line.  In the</br>
GUD buffer, the current file and line are those of the last breakpoint or</br>
step.  In a source buffer, they are the buffer's file and current line.</br>
</br>
M-x gud-remove removes breakpoints on the current file and line.</br>
</br>
C-x C-a C-l displays in the source window the last line referred to</br>
in the gud buffer.</br>
</br>
M-x gud-step, M-x gud-next, and M-x gud-stepi do a step-one-line,</br>
step-one-line (not entering function calls), and step-one-instruction</br>
and then update the source window with the current file and position.</br>
M-x gud-cont continues execution.</br>
</br>
M-x gud-print tries to find the largest C lvalue or function-call expression</br>
around point, and sends it to the debugger for value display.</br>
</br>
The above commands are common to all supported debuggers except xdb which</br>
does not support stepping instructions.</br>
</br>
Under gdb, sdb and xdb, M-x gud-tbreak behaves exactly like M-x gud-break,</br>
except that the breakpoint is temporary; that is, it is removed when</br>
execution stops on it.</br>
</br>
Under gdb, dbx, and xdb, M-x gud-up pops up through an enclosing stack</br>
frame.  M-x gud-down drops back down through one.</br>
</br>
If you are using gdb or xdb, M-x gud-finish runs execution to the return from</br>
the current function and stops.</br>
</br>
All the keystrokes above are accessible in the GUD buffer</br>
with the prefix C-c, and in all buffers through the prefix C-x C-a.</br>
</br>
All pre-defined functions for which the concept make sense repeat</br>
themselves the appropriate number of times if you give a prefix</br>
argument.</br>
</br>
You may use the `gud-def' macro in the initialization hook to define other</br>
commands.</br>
</br>
Other commands for interacting with the debugger process are inherited from</br>
comint mode, which see.</br>
</br>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `comint-mode' might have run,</br>
this mode runs the hook `gud-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
