<strong>gv-define-setter</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>gv.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gv-define-setter <u>NAME</u> <u>ARGLIST</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Define a setter method for generalized variable <u>NAME</u>.</br>
This macro is an easy-to-use substitute for `gv-define-expander' that works</br>
well for simple place forms.</br>
Assignments of VAL to (<u>NAME</u> ARGS...) are expanded by binding the argument</br>
forms (VAL ARGS...) according to <u>ARGLIST</u>, then executing <u>BODY</u>, which must</br>
return a Lisp form that does the assignment.</br>
The first arg in <u>ARGLIST</u> (the one that receives VAL) receives an expression</br>
which can do arbitrary things, whereas the other arguments are all guaranteed</br>
to be pure and copyable.  Example use:</br>
  (gv-define-setter aref (v a i) `(aset ,a ,i ,v))
