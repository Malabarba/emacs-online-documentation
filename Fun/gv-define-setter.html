<strong>gv-define-setter</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>gv.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gv-define-setter NAME ARGLIST &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Define a setter method for generalized variable NAME.<br/>
This macro is an easy-to-use substitute for `gv-define-expander' that works<br/>
well for simple place forms.<br/>
Assignments of VAL to (NAME ARGS...) are expanded by binding the argument<br/>
forms (VAL ARGS...) according to ARGLIST, then executing BODY, which must<br/>
return a Lisp form that does the assignment.<br/>
The first arg in ARGLIST (the one that receives VAL) receives an expression<br/>
which can do arbitrary things, whereas the other arguments are all guaranteed<br/>
to be pure and copyable.  Example use:<br/>
  (gv-define-setter aref (v a i) `(aset ,a ,i ,v))
