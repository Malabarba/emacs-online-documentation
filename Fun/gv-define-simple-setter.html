<strong>gv-define-simple-setter</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>gv.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(gv-define-simple-setter NAME SETTER &optional FIX-RETURN)<br/>
<br/>
Define a simple setter method for generalized variable NAME.<br/>
This macro is an easy-to-use substitute for `gv-define-expander' that works<br/>
well for simple place forms.  Assignments of VAL to (NAME ARGS...) are<br/>
turned into calls of the form (SETTER ARGS... VAL).<br/>
<br/>
If FIX-RETURN is non-nil, then SETTER is not assumed to return VAL and<br/>
instead the assignment is turned into something equivalent to<br/>
  (let ((temp VAL))<br/>
    (SETTER ARGS... temp)<br/>
    temp)<br/>
so as to preserve the semantics of `setf'.
