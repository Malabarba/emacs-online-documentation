<strong>gv-ref</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>gv.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(gv-ref <u>PLACE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a reference to <u>PLACE</u>.</br>
This is like the `&' operator of the C language.</br>
Note: this only works reliably with lexical binding mode, except for very</br>
simple <u>PLACE</u>s such as (function-symbol 'foo) which will also work in dynamic</br>
binding mode.
