handle-save-session is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(handle-save-session EVENT)<br/><br/>Handle the save_yourself event from a session manager.<br/>A session manager can tell Emacs that the window system is shutting down<br/>by sending Emacs a save_yourself message.  Emacs executes this function when<br/>such an event occurs.  This function then executes `emacs-session-save'.<br/>After that, this function informs the session manager that it can continue<br/>or abort shutting down the window system depending on the return value<br/>from `emacs-session-save'  If the return value is non-nil the session manager<br/>is told to abort the window system shutdown.<br/><br/>Do not call this function yourself.
