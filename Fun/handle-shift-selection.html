<strong>handle-shift-selection</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(handle-shift-selection)</br>
</br>
Activate/deactivate mark depending on invocation thru shift translation.</br>
This function is called by `call-interactively' when a command</br>
with a `^' character in its `interactive' spec is invoked, before</br>
running the command itself.</br>
</br>
If `shift-select-mode' is enabled and the command was invoked</br>
through shift translation, set the mark and activate the region</br>
temporarily, unless it was already set in this way.  See</br>
`this-command-keys-shift-translated' for the meaning of shift</br>
translation.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, if the region has been activated temporarily,</br>
deactivate it, and restore the variable `transient-mark-mode' to</br>
its earlier value.
