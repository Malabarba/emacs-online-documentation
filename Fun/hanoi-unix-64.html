hanoi-unix-64 is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `hanoi.el'.<br/><br/>(hanoi-unix-64)<br/><br/>Like hanoi-unix, but pretend to have a 64-bit clock.<br/>This is, necessarily (as of Emacs 20.3), a crock.  When the<br/>current-time interface is made s2G-compliant, hanoi.el will need<br/>to be updated.
