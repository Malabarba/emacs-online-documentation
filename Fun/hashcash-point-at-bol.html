<strong>hashcash-point-at-bol</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="line-beginning-position.html">line-beginning-position</a></strong>' in `<code>hashcash.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hashcash-point-at-bol &optional <u>N</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the character position of the first character on the current line.</br>
With optional argument <u>N</u>, scan forward <u>N</u> - 1 lines first.</br>
If the scan reaches the end of the buffer, return that position.</br>
</br>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the</br>
position of the first character in logical order, i.e. the smallest</br>
character position on the line.</br>
</br>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field</br>
unless that position would be on a different line than the original,</br>
unconstrained result.  If <u>N</u> is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field</br>
starts at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field</br>
boundaries, bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</br>
</br>
This function does not move point.
