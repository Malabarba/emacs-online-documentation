hashcash-point-at-bol is an alias for `line-beginning-position' in `hashcash.el'.<br/><br/>(hashcash-point-at-bol &optional N)<br/><br/>Return the character position of the first character on the current line.<br/>With optional argument N, scan forward N - 1 lines first.<br/>If the scan reaches the end of the buffer, return that position.<br/><br/>This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the<br/>position of the first character in logical order, i.e. the smallest<br/>character position on the line.<br/><br/>This function constrains the returned position to the current field<br/>unless that position would be on a different line than the original,<br/>unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a front-sticky field<br/>starts at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field<br/>boundaries, bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.<br/><br/>This function does not move point.
