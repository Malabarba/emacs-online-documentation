help-setup-xref is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `help-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(help-setup-xref ITEM INTERACTIVE-P)<br/><br/>Invoked from commands using the "*Help*" buffer to install some xref info.<br/><br/>ITEM is a (FUNCTION . ARGS) pair appropriate for recreating the help<br/>buffer after following a reference.  INTERACTIVE-P is non-nil if the<br/>calling command was invoked interactively.  In this case the stack of<br/>items for help buffer "back" buttons is cleared.<br/><br/>This should be called very early, before the output buffer is cleared,<br/>because we want to record the "previous" position of point so we can<br/>restore it properly when going back.
