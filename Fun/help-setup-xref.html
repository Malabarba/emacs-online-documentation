<strong>help-setup-xref</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>help-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(help-setup-xref <u>ITEM</u> <u>INTERACTIVE-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Invoked from commands using the "*Help*" buffer to install some xref info.</br>
</br>
<u>ITEM</u> is a (FUNCTION . ARGS) pair appropriate for recreating the help</br>
buffer after following a reference.  <u>INTERACTIVE-P</u> is non-nil if the</br>
calling command was invoked interactively.  In this case the stack of</br>
items for help buffer "back" buttons is cleared.</br>
</br>
This should be called very early, before the output buffer is cleared,</br>
because we want to record the "previous" position of point so we can</br>
restore it properly when going back.
