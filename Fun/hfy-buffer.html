<strong>hfy-buffer</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hfy-buffer)</br>
</br>
Generate a buffer to hold the HTML output.</br>
The filename of this buffer is derived from the source (current) buffer's</br>
variable `buffer-file-name', if it is set, plus `hfy-extn'.</br>
Otherwise a plausible filename is constructed from `default-directory',</br>
`buffer-name' and `hfy-extn'.
