<strong>hfy-dirname</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hfy-dirname <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return everything preceding the last "/" from a relative filename <u>FILE</u>,</br>
on the assumption that this will produce a relative directory name.</br>
Hardly bombproof, but good enough in the context in which it is being used.
