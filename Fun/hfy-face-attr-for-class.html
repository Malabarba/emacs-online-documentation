<strong>hfy-face-attr-for-class</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(hfy-face-attr-for-class FACE &optional CLASS)<br/>
<br/>
Return the face attributes for FACE.<br/>
If CLASS is set, it must be a `defface' alist key [see below],<br/>
in which case the first face specification returned by `hfy-combined-face-spec'<br/>
which *doesn't* clash with CLASS is returned.<br/>
<br/>
(A specification with a class of t is considered to match any class you<br/>
specify - this matches Emacs's behavior when deciding on which face attributes<br/>
to use, to the best of my understanding).<br/>
<br/>
If CLASS is nil, then you just get whatever `face-attr-construct' returns,<br/>
ie the current specification in effect for FACE.<br/>
<br/>
*NOTE*: This function forces any face that is not 'default and which has<br/>
no :inherit property to inherit from 'default (this is because 'default<br/>
is magical in that Emacs's fonts behave as if they inherit implicitly from<br/>
'default, but no such behavior exists in HTML/CSS).<br/>
<br/>
See also `hfy-display-class' for details of valid values for CLASS.
