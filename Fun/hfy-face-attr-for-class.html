<strong>hfy-face-attr-for-class</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hfy-face-attr-for-class <u>FACE</u> &optional <u>CLASS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the face attributes for <u>FACE</u>.</br>
If <u>CLASS</u> is set, it must be a `defface' alist key [see below],</br>
in which case the first face specification returned by `hfy-combined-face-spec'</br>
which *doesn't* clash with <u>CLASS</u> is returned.</br>
</br>
<code>(A specification with a class of t is considered to match any class yo</code>u</br>
specify - this matches Emacs's behavior when deciding on which face attributes</br>
to use, to the best of my understanding).</br>
</br>
If <u>CLASS</u> is nil, then you just get whatever `face-attr-construct' returns,</br>
ie the current specification in effect for <u>FACE</u>.</br>
</br>
*NOTE*: This function forces any face that is not 'default and which has</br>
no :inherit property to inherit from 'default (this is because 'default</br>
is magical in that Emacs's fonts behave as if they inherit implicitly from</br>
'default, but no such behavior exists in HTML/CSS).</br>
</br>
See also `hfy-display-class' for details of valid values for <u>CLASS</u>.
