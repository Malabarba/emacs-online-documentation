<strong>hfy-face-to-style-i</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(hfy-face-to-style-i FN)<br/>
<br/>
The guts of `hfy-face-to-style': FN should be a `defface' font spec,<br/>
as returned by `face-attr-construct' or `hfy-face-attr-for-class'.<br/>
Note that this function does not get font-sizes right if they are based<br/>
on inherited modifiers (via the :inherit) attribute, and any other<br/>
modifiers that are cumulative if they appear multiple times need to be<br/>
merged by the user - `hfy-flatten-style' should do this.
