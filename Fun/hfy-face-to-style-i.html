hfy-face-to-style-i is a compiled Lisp function in `htmlfontify.el'.<br/><br/>(hfy-face-to-style-i FN)<br/><br/>The guts of `hfy-face-to-style': FN should be a `defface' font spec,<br/>as returned by `face-attr-construct' or `hfy-face-attr-for-class'.<br/>Note that this function does not get font-sizes right if they are based<br/>on inherited modifiers (via the :inherit) attribute, and any other<br/>modifiers that are cumulative if they appear multiple times need to be<br/>merged by the user - `hfy-flatten-style' should do this.
