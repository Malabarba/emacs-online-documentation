<strong>hfy-flatten-style</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hfy-flatten-style <u>STYLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Take <u>STYLE</u> (see `hfy-face-to-style-i', `hfy-face-to-style') and merge</br>
any multiple attributes appropriately.  Currently only font-size is merged</br>
down to a single occurrence - others may need special handling, but I</br>
haven't encountered them yet.  Returns a `hfy-style-assoc'.
