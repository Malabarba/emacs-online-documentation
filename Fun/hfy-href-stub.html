hfy-href-stub is a compiled Lisp function in `htmlfontify.el'.<br/><br/>(hfy-href-stub THIS-FILE DEF-FILES TAG)<br/><br/>Return an href stub for a tag href in THIS-FILE.<br/>If DEF-FILES (list of files containing definitions for the tag in question)<br/>contains only one entry, the href should link straight to that file.<br/>Otherwise, the link should be to the index file.<br/><br/>We are not yet concerned with the file extensions/tag line number and so on at<br/>this point.<br/><br/>If `hfy-split-index' is set, and the href wil be to an index file rather than<br/>a source file, append a .X to `hfy-index-file', where X is the uppercased<br/>first character of TAG.<br/><br/>See also `hfy-relstub', `hfy-index-file'.
