hfy-triplet is a compiled Lisp function in `htmlfontify.el'.<br/><br/>(hfy-triplet COLOUR)<br/><br/>Takes a COLOUR name (string) and return a CSS rgb(R, G, B) triplet string.<br/>Uses the definition of "white" to map the numbers to the 0-255 range, so<br/>if you've redefined white, (esp. if you've redefined it to have a triplet<br/>member lower than that of the color you are processing) strange things<br/>may happen.
