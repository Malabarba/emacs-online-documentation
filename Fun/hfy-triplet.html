<strong>hfy-triplet</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hfy-triplet <u>COLOUR</u>)</br>
</br>
Takes a <u>COLOUR</u> name (string) and return a CSS rgb(R, G, B) triplet string.</br>
Uses the definition of "white" to map the numbers to the 0-255 range, so</br>
if you've redefined white, (esp. if you've redefined it to have a triplet</br>
member lower than that of the color you are processing) strange things</br>
may happen.
