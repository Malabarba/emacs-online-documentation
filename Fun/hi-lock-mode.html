<strong>hi-lock-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>hi-lock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(hi-lock-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle selective highlighting of patterns (Hi Lock mode).<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hi Lock mode if ARG is<br/>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br/>
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/>
<br/>
Hi Lock mode is automatically enabled when you invoke any of the<br/>
highlighting commands listed below, such as M-s h r.<br/>
To enable Hi Lock mode in all buffers, use `global-hi-lock-mode'<br/>
or add (global-hi-lock-mode 1) to your init file.<br/>
<br/>
In buffers where Font Lock mode is enabled, patterns are<br/>
highlighted using font lock.  In buffers where Font Lock mode is<br/>
disabled, patterns are applied using overlays; in this case, the<br/>
highlighting will not be updated as you type.<br/>
<br/>
When Hi Lock mode is enabled, a "Regexp Highlighting" submenu<br/>
is added to the "Edit" menu.  The commands in the submenu,<br/>
which can be called interactively, are:<br/>
<br/>
M-s h r REGEXP FACE<br/>
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.<br/>
<br/>
M-s h p PHRASE FACE<br/>
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.<br/>
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches<br/>
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)<br/>
<br/>
M-s h l REGEXP FACE<br/>
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.<br/>
<br/>
M-s h u REGEXP<br/>
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
M-s h w<br/>
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible).  They may<br/>
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the M-s h f command<br/>
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.<br/>
  (See `font-lock-keywords'.)  They may be edited and re-loaded with M-s h f,<br/>
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.  When a file is<br/>
  loaded the patterns are read if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is<br/>
  'ask and the user responds y to the prompt, or if<br/>
  `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is bound to a function and that<br/>
  function returns t.<br/>
<br/>
M-s h f<br/>
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by M-s h w).<br/>
<br/>
When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded or patterns<br/>
rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the<br/>
form:<br/>
  Hi-lock: FOO<br/>
<br/>
where FOO is a list of patterns.  The patterns must start before<br/>
position (number of characters into buffer)<br/>
`hi-lock-file-patterns-range'.  Patterns will be read until<br/>
Hi-lock: end is found.  A mode is excluded if it's in the list<br/>
`hi-lock-exclude-modes'.
