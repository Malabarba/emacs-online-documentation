highlight-compare-with-file is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `hilit-chg.el'.<br/><br/>(highlight-compare-with-file FILE-B)<br/><br/>Compare this buffer with a file, and highlight differences.<br/><br/>If the buffer has a backup filename, it is used as the default when<br/>this function is called interactively.<br/><br/>If the current buffer is visiting the file being compared against, it<br/>also will have its differences highlighted.  Otherwise, the file is<br/>read in temporarily but the buffer is deleted.<br/><br/>If the buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property<br/>changes are made, so M-x highlight-changes-next-change and<br/>M-x highlight-changes-previous-change will not work.
