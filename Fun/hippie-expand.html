</br>
</br>
(hippie-expand <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Try to expand text before point, using multiple methods.</br>
The expansion functions in `hippie-expand-try-functions-list' are</br>
tried in order, until a possible expansion is found.  Repeated</br>
application of `hippie-expand' inserts successively possible</br>
expansions.</br>
With a positive numeric argument, jumps directly to the <u>ARG</u> next</br>
function in this list.  With a negative argument or just C-u,</br>
undoes the expansion.
