<strong>holiday-list</strong> is an alias for `list-holidays' in `<code>holidays.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(holiday-list Y1 &optional Y2 L LABEL)<br/>
<br/>
Display holidays for years Y1 to Y2 (inclusive).<br/>
Y2 defaults to Y1.  The optional list of holidays L defaults to<br/>
`calendar-holidays'.  If you want to control what holidays are<br/>
displayed, use a different list.  For example,<br/>
<br/>
  (list-holidays 2006 2006<br/>
    (append holiday-general-holidays holiday-local-holidays))<br/>
<br/>
will display holidays for the year 2006 defined in the two<br/>
mentioned lists, and nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
When called interactively, this command offers a choice of<br/>
holidays, based on the variables `holiday-solar-holidays' etc.  See the<br/>
documentation of `calendar-holidays' for a list of the variables<br/>
that control the choices, as well as a description of the format<br/>
of a holiday list.<br/>
<br/>
The optional LABEL is used to label the buffer created.
