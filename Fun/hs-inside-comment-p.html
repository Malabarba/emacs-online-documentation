<strong>hs-inside-comment-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>hideshow.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(hs-inside-comment-p)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if point is inside a comment, otherwise nil.</br>
Actually, return a list containing the buffer position of the start</br>
and the end of the comment.  A comment block can be hidden only if on</br>
its starting line there is only whitespace preceding the actual comment</br>
beginning.  If we are inside of a comment but this condition is not met,</br>
we return a list having a nil as its car and the end of comment position</br>
as cdr.
