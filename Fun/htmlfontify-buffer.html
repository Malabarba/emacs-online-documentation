<strong>htmlfontify-buffer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlfontify.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(htmlfontify-buffer &optional <u>SRCDIR</u> <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Create a new buffer, named for the current buffer + a .html extension,</br>
containing an inline CSS-stylesheet and formatted CSS-markup HTML</br>
that reproduces the look of the current Emacs buffer as closely</br>
as possible.</br>
</br>
Dangerous characters in the existing buffer are turned into HTML</br>
entities, so you should even be able to do HTML-within-HTML</br>
fontified display.</br>
</br>
You should, however, note that random control or eight-bit</br>
characters such as ^L () or Â¤ (\244) won't get mapped yet.</br>
</br>
If the <u>SRCDIR</u> and <u>FILE</u> arguments are set, lookup etags derived</br>
entries in the `hfy-tags-cache' and add HTML anchors and</br>
hyperlinks as appropriate.
