<strong>htmlize-buffer</strong> is an interactive Lisp function in `<code>htmlize.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(htmlize-buffer &optional <u>BUFFER</u>)</br>
</br>
Convert <u>BUFFER</u> to HTML, preserving colors and decorations.</br>
</br>
The generated HTML is available in a new buffer, which is returned.</br>
When invoked interactively, the new buffer is selected in the current</br>
window.  The title of the generated document will be set to the buffer's</br>
file name or, if that's not available, to the buffer's name.</br>
</br>
Note that htmlize doesn't fontify your buffers, it only uses the</br>
decorations that are already present.  If you don't set up font-lock or</br>
something else to fontify your buffers, the resulting HTML will be</br>
plain.  Likewise, if you don't like the choice of colors, fix the mode</br>
that created them, or simply alter the faces it uses.
