<strong>htmlize-make-file-name</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>htmlize.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(htmlize-make-file-name <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Make an HTML file name from <u>FILE</u>.</br>
</br>
In its default implementation, this simply appends `.html' to <u>FILE</u>.</br>
This function is called by htmlize to create the buffer file name, and</br>
by `htmlize-file' to create the target file name.</br>
</br>
More elaborate transformations are conceivable, such as changing <u>FILE</u>'s</br>
extension to `.html' ("file.c" -> "file.html").  If you want them,</br>
overload this function to do it and htmlize will comply.
