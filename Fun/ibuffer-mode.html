<strong>ibuffer-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ibuffer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ibuffer-mode)</br>
</br>
Parent mode: `special-mode'.</br>
</br>
A major mode for viewing a list of buffers.</br>
In Ibuffer, you can conveniently perform many operations on the</br>
currently open buffers, in addition to filtering your view to a</br>
particular subset of them, and sorting by various criteria.</br>
</br>
Operations on marked buffers:</br>
</br>
  'S' - Save the marked buffers</br>
  'A' - View the marked buffers in this frame.</br>
  'H' - View the marked buffers in another frame.</br>
  'V' - Revert the marked buffers.</br>
  'T' - Toggle read-only state of marked buffers.</br>
  'D' - Kill the marked buffers.</br>
  'M-s a C-s' - Do incremental search in the marked buffers.</br>
  'M-s a C-M-s' - Isearch for regexp in the marked buffers.</br>
  'U' - Replace by regexp in each of the marked</br>
          buffers.</br>
  'Q' - Query replace in each of the marked buffers.</br>
  'I' - As above, with a regular expression.</br>
  'P' - Print the marked buffers.</br>
  'O' - List lines in all marked buffers which match</br>
          a given regexp (like the function `occur').</br>
  'X' - Pipe the contents of the marked</br>
          buffers to a shell command.</br>
  'N' - Replace the contents of the marked</br>
          buffers with the output of a shell command.</br>
  '!' - Run a shell command with the</br>
          buffer's file as an argument.</br>
  'E' - Evaluate a form in each of the marked buffers.  This</br>
          is a very flexible command.  For example, if you want to make all</br>
          of the marked buffers read only, try using (read-only-mode 1) as</br>
          the input form.</br>
  'W' - As above, but view each buffer while the form</br>
          is evaluated.</br>
  'k' - Remove the marked lines from the *Ibuffer* buffer,</br>
          but don't kill the associated buffer.</br>
  'x' - Kill all buffers marked for deletion.</br>
</br>
Marking commands:</br>
</br>
  'm' - Mark the buffer at point.</br>
  't' - Unmark all currently marked buffers, and mark</br>
          all unmarked buffers.</br>
  'u' - Unmark the buffer at point.</br>
  'DEL' - Unmark the buffer at point, and move to the</br>
          previous line.</br>
  'M-DEL' - Unmark all marked buffers.</br>
  '* M' - Mark buffers by major mode.</br>
  '* u' - Mark all "unsaved" buffers.</br>
          This means that the buffer is modified, and has an associated file.</br>
  '* m' - Mark all modified buffers,</br>
          regardless of whether or not they have an associated file.</br>
  '* s' - Mark all buffers whose name begins and</br>
          ends with '*'.</br>
  '* e' - Mark all buffers which have</br>
          an associated file, but that file doesn't currently exist.</br>
  '* r' - Mark all read-only buffers.</br>
  '* /' - Mark buffers in `dired' mode.</br>
  '* h' - Mark buffers in `help-mode', `apropos-mode', etc.</br>
  '.' - Mark buffers older than `ibuffer-old-time'.</br>
  'd' - Mark the buffer at point for deletion.</br>
  '% n' - Mark buffers by their name, using a regexp.</br>
  '% m' - Mark buffers by their major mode, using a regexp.</br>
  '% f' - Mark buffers by their filename, using a regexp.</br>

</br>
** Information on Filtering:</br>
</br>
 You can filter your ibuffer view via different criteria.  Each Ibuffer</br>
buffer has its own stack of active filters.  For example, suppose you</br>
are working on an Emacs Lisp project.  You can create an Ibuffer</br>
buffer displays buffers in just `emacs-lisp' modes via</br>
'M-x ibuffer-filter-by-mode emacs-lisp-mode RET'.  In this case, there</br>
is just one entry on the filtering stack.</br>
</br>
You can also combine filters.  The various filtering commands push a</br>
new filter onto the stack, and the filters combine to show just</br>
buffers which satisfy ALL criteria on the stack.  For example, suppose</br>
you only want to see buffers in `emacs-lisp' mode, whose names begin</br>
with "gnus".  You can accomplish this via:</br>
'M-x ibuffer-filter-by-mode emacs-lisp-mode RET</br>
/ n ^gnus RET'.</br>
</br>
Additionally, you can OR the top two filters together with</br>
'M-x ibuffer-or-filters'.  To see all buffers in either</br>
`emacs-lisp-mode' or `lisp-interaction-mode', type:</br>
</br>
'M-x ibuffer-filter-by-mode emacs-lisp-mode RET M-x ibuffer-filter-by-mode lisp-interaction-mode RET M-x ibuffer-or-filters'.</br>
</br>
Filters can also be saved and restored using mnemonic names: see the</br>
functions `ibuffer-save-filters' and `ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filters'.</br>
</br>
To remove the top filter on the stack, use '/ p', and</br>
to disable all filtering currently in effect, use</br>
'/ /'.</br>
</br>
** Filter Groups:</br>
</br>
Once one has mastered filters, the next logical step up is "filter</br>
groups".  A filter group is basically a named group of buffers which</br>
match a filter, which are displayed together in an Ibuffer buffer.  To</br>
create a filter group, simply use the regular functions to create a</br>
filter, and then type '/ g'.</br>
</br>
A quick example will make things clearer.  Suppose that one wants to</br>
group all of one's Emacs Lisp buffers together.  To do this, type</br>
</br>
'M-x ibuffer-filter-by-mode emacs-lisp-mode RET / g RET emacs lisp buffers RET'</br>
</br>
You may, of course, name the group whatever you want; it doesn't have</br>
to be "emacs lisp buffers".  Filter groups may be composed of any</br>
arbitrary combination of filters.</br>
</br>
Just like filters themselves, filter groups act as a stack.  Buffers</br>
will not be displayed multiple times if they would be included in</br>
multiple filter groups; instead, the first filter group is used.  The</br>
filter groups are displayed in this order of precedence.</br>
</br>
You may rearrange filter groups by using the regular</br>
'C-k' and 'C-y' pair.  Yanked groups</br>
will be inserted before the group at point.</br>
</br>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `special-mode' might have run,</br>
this mode runs the hook `ibuffer-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.
