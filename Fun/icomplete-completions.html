<strong>icomplete-completions</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>icomplete.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(icomplete-completions <u>NAME</u> <u>CANDIDATES</u> <u>PREDICATE</u> <u>REQUIRE-MATCH</u>)</br>
</br>
Identify prospective candidates for minibuffer completion.</br>
</br>
The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during</br>
minibuffer completion.</br>
</br>
Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by</br>
one of (), [], or {} pairs.  The choice of brackets is as follows:</br>
</br>
  (...) - a single prospect is identified and matching is enforced,</br>
  [...] - a single prospect is identified but matching is optional, or</br>
  {...} - multiple prospects, separated by commas, are indicated, and</br>
          further input is required to distinguish a single one.</br>
</br>
If there are multiple possibilities, `icomplete-separator' separates them.</br>
</br>
The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [Matched]' appended</br>
(whether complete or not), or ` [No matches]', if no eligible</br>
matches exist.
