<strong>icomplete-completions</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>icomplete.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(icomplete-completions NAME CANDIDATES PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH)<br/>
<br/>
Identify prospective candidates for minibuffer completion.<br/>
<br/>
The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during<br/>
minibuffer completion.<br/>
<br/>
Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by<br/>
one of (), [], or {} pairs.  The choice of brackets is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
  (...) - a single prospect is identified and matching is enforced,<br/>
  [...] - a single prospect is identified but matching is optional, or<br/>
  {...} - multiple prospects, separated by commas, are indicated, and<br/>
          further input is required to distinguish a single one.<br/>
<br/>
The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [Matched]' appended<br/>
(whether complete or not), or ` [No matches]', if no eligible<br/>
matches exist.  (Keybindings for uniquely matched commands<br/>
are exhibited within the square braces.)
