<strong>icomplete-simple-completing-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>icomplete.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(icomplete-simple-completing-p)<br/>
<br/>
Non-nil if current window is minibuffer that's doing simple completion.<br/>
<br/>
Conditions are:<br/>
   the selected window is a minibuffer,<br/>
   and not in the middle of macro execution,<br/>
   and `minibuffer-completion-table' is not a symbol (which would<br/>
       indicate some non-standard, non-simple completion mechanism,<br/>
       like file-name and other custom-func completions).
