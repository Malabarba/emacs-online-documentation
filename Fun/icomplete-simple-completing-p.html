<strong>icomplete-simple-completing-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>icomplete.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(icomplete-simple-completing-p)</br>
</br>
Non-nil if current window is a minibuffer that's doing simple completion.</br>
</br>
Conditions are:</br>
   the selected window is a minibuffer,</br>
   and not in the middle of macro execution,</br>
   and the completion table is not a function (which would</br>
       indicate some non-standard, non-simple completion mechanism,</br>
       like file-name and other custom-func completions),</br>
   and `icomplete-with-completion-tables' doesn't restrict completion.
