<strong>icon-indent-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>icon.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(icon-indent-command &optional <u>WHOLE-EXP</u>)</br>
</br>
Indent current line as Icon code, or in some cases insert a tab character.</br>
If `icon-tab-always-indent' is non-nil (the default), always indent current</br>
line.  Otherwise, indent the current line only if point is at the left margin</br>
or in the line's indentation; otherwise insert a tab.</br>
</br>
A numeric argument, regardless of its value, means indent rigidly all the</br>
lines of the expression starting after point so that this line becomes</br>
properly indented.  The relative indentation among the lines of the</br>
expression are preserved.
