<strong>idlwave-action-and-binding</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(idlwave-action-and-binding <u>KEY</u> <u>CMD</u> &optional <u>SELECT</u>)</br>
</br>
<u>KEY</u> and <u>CMD</u> are made into a key binding and an indent action.</br>
<u>KEY</u> is a string - same as for the `define-key' function.  <u>CMD</u> is a</br>
function of no arguments or a list to be evaluated.  <u>CMD</u> is bound to</br>
<u>KEY</u> in `idlwave-mode-map' by defining an anonymous function calling</br>
`self-insert-command' followed by <u>CMD</u>.  If <u>KEY</u> contains more than one</br>
character a binding will only be set if <u>SELECT</u> is 'both.</br>
</br>
<code>(<u>KEY</u> . <u>CMD</u>) is also placed in the `idlwave-indent-expand-table'</code>,</br>
replacing any previous value for <u>KEY</u>.  If a binding is not set then it</br>
will instead be placed in `idlwave-indent-action-table'.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>SELECT</u> is nil then an action and binding are</br>
created.  If <u>SELECT</u> is 'noaction, then a binding is always set and no</br>
action is created.  If <u>SELECT</u> is 'both then an action and binding</br>
will both be created even if <u>KEY</u> contains more than one character.</br>
Otherwise, if <u>SELECT</u> is non-nil then only an action is created.</br>
</br>
Some examples:</br>
No spaces before and 1 after a comma</br>
   (idlwave-action-and-binding ","  '(idlwave-surround 0 1))</br>
A minimum of 1 space before and after `=' (see `idlwave-expand-equal').</br>
   (idlwave-action-and-binding "="  '(idlwave-expand-equal -1 -1))</br>
Capitalize system variables - action only</br>
   (idlwave-action-and-binding idlwave-sysvar '(capitalize-word 1) t)
