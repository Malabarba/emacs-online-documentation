idlwave-action-and-binding is a compiled Lisp function in `idlwave.el'.<br/><br/>(idlwave-action-and-binding KEY CMD &optional SELECT)<br/><br/>KEY and CMD are made into a key binding and an indent action.<br/>KEY is a string - same as for the `define-key' function.  CMD is a<br/>function of no arguments or a list to be evaluated.  CMD is bound to<br/>KEY in `idlwave-mode-map' by defining an anonymous function calling<br/>`self-insert-command' followed by CMD.  If KEY contains more than one<br/>character a binding will only be set if SELECT is 'both.<br/><br/>(KEY . CMD) is also placed in the `idlwave-indent-expand-table',<br/>replacing any previous value for KEY.  If a binding is not set then it<br/>will instead be placed in `idlwave-indent-action-table'.<br/><br/>If the optional argument SELECT is nil then an action and binding are<br/>created.  If SELECT is 'noaction, then a binding is always set and no<br/>action is created.  If SELECT is 'both then an action and binding<br/>will both be created even if KEY contains more than one character.<br/>Otherwise, if SELECT is non-nil then only an action is created.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/>No spaces before and 1 after a comma<br/>   (idlwave-action-and-binding ","  '(idlwave-surround 0 1))<br/>A minimum of 1 space before and after `=' (see `idlwave-expand-equal').<br/>   (idlwave-action-and-binding "="  '(idlwave-expand-equal -1 -1))<br/>Capitalize system variables - action only<br/>   (idlwave-action-and-binding idlwave-sysvar '(capitalize-word 1) t)
