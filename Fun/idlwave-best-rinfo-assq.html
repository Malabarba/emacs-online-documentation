<br/>
(idlwave-best-rinfo-assq NAME TYPE CLASS LIST &optional WITH-FILE KEEP-SYSTEM)<br/>
<br/>
Like `idlwave-rinfo-assq', but get all twins and sort, then return first.<br/>
If WITH-FILE is passed, find the best rinfo entry with a file<br/>
included.  If KEEP-SYSTEM is set, don't prune system for compiled<br/>
syslib files.
