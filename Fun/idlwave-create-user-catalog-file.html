<strong>idlwave-create-user-catalog-file</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-create-user-catalog-file &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Scan all files on selected dirs of IDL search path for routine information.<br/>
<br/>
A widget checklist will allow you to choose the directories.  Write<br/>
the result as a file `idlwave-user-catalog-file'.  When this file<br/>
exists, it will be automatically loaded to give routine information<br/>
about library routines.  With ARG, just rescan the same directories<br/>
as last time - so no widget will pop up.
