<strong>idlwave-do-action</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(idlwave-do-action <u>ACTION</u>)</br>
</br>
Perform an action repeatedly on a line.</br>
<u>ACTION</u> is a list (REG . FUNC).  REG is a regular expression.  FUNC is</br>
either a function name to be called with `funcall' or a list to be</br>
evaluated with `eval'.  The action performed by FUNC should leave</br>
point after the match for REG - otherwise an infinite loop may be</br>
entered.  FUNC is always passed a final argument of 'is-action, so it</br>
can discriminate between being run as an action, or a key binding.
