<strong>idlwave-expand-equal</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-expand-equal &optional BEFORE AFTER IS-ACTION)<br/>
<br/>
Pad '=' with spaces.<br/>
Two cases: Assignment statement, and keyword assignment.<br/>
Which case is determined using `idlwave-start-of-substatement' and<br/>
`idlwave-statement-type'.  The equal sign will be surrounded by BEFORE<br/>
and AFTER blanks.  If `idlwave-pad-keyword' is t then keyword assignment<br/>
is treated just like assignment statements.  When nil, spaces are<br/>
removed for keyword assignment.  Any other value keeps the current space<br/>
around the `='.  Limits in for loops are treated as keyword assignment.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with IDL 6.0, a number of op= assignments are available.<br/>
Since ambiguities of the form:<br/>
<br/>
r and= b<br/>
rand= b<br/>
<br/>
can occur, alphanumeric operator assignment will never be pre-padded,<br/>
only post-padded.  You must use a space before these to disambiguate<br/>
(not just for padding, but for proper parsing by IDL too!).  Other<br/>
operators, such as ##=, ^=, etc., will be pre-padded.<br/>
<br/>
IS-ACTION is ignored.<br/>
