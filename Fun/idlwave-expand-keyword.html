<strong>idlwave-expand-keyword</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-expand-keyword KEYWORD MODULE)<br/>
<br/>
Expand KEYWORD to one of the valid keyword parameters of MODULE.<br/>
KEYWORD may be an exact match or an abbreviation of a keyword.<br/>
If the match is exact, KEYWORD itself is returned, even if there may be other<br/>
keywords of which KEYWORD is an abbreviation.  This is necessary because some<br/>
system routines have keywords which are prefixes of other keywords.<br/>
If KEYWORD is an abbreviation of several keywords, a list of all possible<br/>
completions is returned.<br/>
If the abbreviation was unique, the correct keyword is returned.<br/>
If it cannot be a keyword, the function return nil.<br/>
If we do not know about MODULE, just return KEYWORD literally.
