<strong>idlwave-fill-paragraph</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(idlwave-fill-paragraph &optional <u>NOHANG</u>)</br>
</br>
Fill paragraphs in comments.</br>
A paragraph is made up of all contiguous lines having the same comment</br>
leader (the leading whitespace before the comment delimiter and the</br>
comment delimiter).  In addition, paragraphs are separated by blank</br>
line comments.  The indentation is given by the hanging indent of the</br>
first line, otherwise by the minimum indentation of the lines after</br>
the first line.  The indentation of the first line does not change.</br>
Does not effect code lines.  Does not fill comments on the same line</br>
with code.  The hanging indent is given by the end of the first match</br>
matching `idlwave-hang-indent-regexp' on the paragraph's first line.</br>
If the optional argument <u>NOHANG</u> is non-nil then the hanging indent is</br>
ignored.
