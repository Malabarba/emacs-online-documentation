In addition, paragraphs are separated by blank<br/>line comments.  The indentation is given by the hanging indent of the<br/>first line, otherwise by the minimum indentation of the lines after<br/>the first line.  The indentation of the first line does not change.<br/>Does not effect code lines.  Does not fill comments on the same line<br/>with code.
