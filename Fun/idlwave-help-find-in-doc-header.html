<strong>idlwave-help-find-in-doc-header</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlw-help.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-help-find-in-doc-header NAME TYPE CLASS KEYWORD &optional EXACT)<br/>
<br/>
Find the requested help in the doc-header above point.<br/>
<br/>
First checks if there is a doc-lib header which describes the correct<br/>
routine.  Then tries to find the KEYWORDS section and the KEYWORD, if<br/>
given.  Returns the point which should be window start of the help<br/>
window.  If EXACT is non-nil, the full help position must be found -<br/>
down to the keyword requested.  This setting is for context help, if<br/>
the exact spot is needed.<br/>
<br/>
If EXACT is nil, the position of the header is returned if it<br/>
describes the correct routine - even if the keyword description cannot<br/>
be found.  TYPE is ignored.<br/>
<br/>
This function expects a more or less standard routine header.  In<br/>
particular it looks for the `NAME:' tag, either with a colon, or alone<br/>
on a line.  Then `NAME:' must be followed by the routine name on the<br/>
same or the next line.  When KEYWORD is non-nil, looks first for a<br/>
`KEYWORDS' section.  It is amazing how inconsistent this is through<br/>
some IDL libraries I have seen.  We settle for a line containing an<br/>
upper case "KEYWORD" string.  If this line is not found we search<br/>
for the keyword anyway to increase the hit-rate<br/>
<br/>
When one of these sections exists we check for a line starting with any of<br/>
<br/>
  /KEYWORD  KEYWORD-  KEYWORD=  KEYWORD<br/>
<br/>
with spaces allowed between the keyword and the following dash or equal sign.<br/>
If there is a match, we assume it is the keyword description.
