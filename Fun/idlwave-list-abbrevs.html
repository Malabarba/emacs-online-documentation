<strong>idlwave-list-abbrevs</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(idlwave-list-abbrevs <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Show the code abbreviations define in IDLWAVE mode.</br>
This lists all abbrevs where the replacement text differs from the input text.</br>
These are the ones the users want to learn to speed up their writing.</br>
</br>
The function does *not* list abbrevs which replace a word with itself</br>
to call a hook.  These hooks are used to change the case of words or</br>
to blink the matching `begin', and the user does not need to know them.</br>
</br>
With arg, list all abbrevs with the corresponding hook.</br>
</br>
This function was written since `list-abbrevs' looks terrible for IDLWAVE mode.
