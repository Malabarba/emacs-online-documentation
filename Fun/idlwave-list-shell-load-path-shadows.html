</br>
</br>
(idlwave-list-shell-load-path-shadows &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
List the load path shadows of all routines compiled under the shell.</br>
This is very useful for checking an IDL application.  Just compile the</br>
application, do RESOLVE_ALL, and `C-c C-i' to compile all referenced</br>
routines and update IDLWAVE internal info.  Then check for shadowing</br>
with this command.
