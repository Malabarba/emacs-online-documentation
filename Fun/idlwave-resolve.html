<strong>idlwave-resolve</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(idlwave-resolve &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Call RESOLVE_ROUTINE on the module name at point.</br>
Like `idlwave-routine-info', this looks for a routine call at point.</br>
After confirmation in the minibuffer, it will use the shell to issue</br>
a RESOLVE call for this routine, to attempt to make it defined and its</br>
routine info available for IDLWAVE.  If the routine is a method call,</br>
both `class__method' and `class__define' will be tried.</br>
With <u>ARG</u>, enforce query for the class of object methods.
