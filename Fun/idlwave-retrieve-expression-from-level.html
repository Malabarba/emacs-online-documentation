idlwave-retrieve-expression-from-level is a compiled Lisp function in `idlw-shell.el'.<br/><br/>(idlwave-retrieve-expression-from-level EXPR LEVEL)<br/><br/>Return IDL command to print the expression EXPR from stack level LEVEL.<br/><br/>It does not seem possible to evaluate an expression on a different<br/>level than the current.  Therefore, this function retrieves variables<br/>by reference from other levels, and then includes that variable in<br/>place of the chosen one.<br/><br/>Since this function depends upon the undocumented IDL routine<br/>routine_names, there is no guarantee that this will work with future<br/>versions of IDL.
