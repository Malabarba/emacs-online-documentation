<strong>idlwave-scan-library-catalogs</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-scan-library-catalogs &optional MESSAGE-BASE NO-LOAD)<br/>
<br/>
Scan for library catalog files (.idlwave_catalog) and ingest.<br/>
<br/>
All directories on `idlwave-path-alist' (or `idlwave-library-path'<br/>
instead, if present) are searched.  Print MESSAGE-BASE along with the<br/>
libraries being loaded, if passed, and skip loading/normalizing if<br/>
NO-LOAD is non-nil.  The variable `idlwave-use-library-catalogs' can<br/>
be set to nil to disable library catalog scanning.
