idlwave-shell-run-region is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `idlw-shell.el'.<br/><br/>(idlwave-shell-run-region BEG END &optional N)<br/><br/>Compile and run the region using the IDL process.<br/>Copies the region to a temporary file `idlwave-shell-temp-pro-file'<br/>and issues the IDL .run command for the file.  Because the region<br/>is compiled and run as a main program there is no problem with<br/>begin-end blocks extending over multiple lines - which would be<br/>a problem if `idlwave-shell-evaluate-region' was used.<br/>An END statement is appended to the region if necessary.<br/><br/>If there is a prefix argument, display IDL process.
