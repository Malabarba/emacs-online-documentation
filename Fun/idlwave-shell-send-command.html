idlwave-shell-send-command is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `idlw-shell.el'.<br/><br/>(idlwave-shell-send-command &optional CMD PCMD HIDE PREEMPT SHOW-IF-ERROR)<br/><br/>Send a command to IDL process.<br/><br/>(CMD PCMD HIDE) are placed at the end of `idlwave-shell-pending-commands'.<br/>If IDL is ready the first command in `idlwave-shell-pending-commands',<br/>CMD, is sent to the IDL process.<br/><br/>If optional second argument PCMD is non-nil it will be placed on<br/>`idlwave-shell-post-command-hook' when CMD is executed.<br/><br/>If the optional third argument HIDE is non-nil, then hide output from<br/>CMD, unless it is the symbol 'mostly, in which case only output<br/>beginning with "%" is hidden, and all other output (i.e., the<br/>results of a PRINT command), is shown.  This helps with, e.g.,<br/>stepping through code with output.<br/><br/>If optional fourth argument PREEMPT is non-nil CMD is put at front of<br/>`idlwave-shell-pending-commands'.  If PREEMPT is 'wait, wait for all<br/>output to complete and the next prompt to arrive before returning<br/>(useful if you need an answer now).  IDL is considered ready if the<br/>prompt is present and if `idlwave-shell-ready' is non-nil.<br/><br/>If SHOW-IF-ERROR is non-nil, show the output if it contains an error<br/>message, independent of what HIDE is set to.
