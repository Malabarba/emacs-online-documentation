idlwave-shell is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `idlw-shell.el'.<br/><br/>(idlwave-shell &optional ARG QUICK)<br/><br/>Run an inferior IDL, with I/O through buffer `(idlwave-shell-buffer)'.<br/>If buffer exists but shell process is not running, start new IDL.<br/>If buffer exists and shell process is running, just switch to the buffer.<br/><br/>When called with a prefix ARG, or when `idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame'<br/>is non-nil, the shell buffer and the source buffers will be in<br/>separate frames.<br/><br/>The command to run comes from variable `idlwave-shell-explicit-file-name',<br/>with options taken from `idlwave-shell-command-line-options'.<br/><br/>The buffer is put in `idlwave-shell-mode', providing commands for sending<br/>input and controlling the IDL job.  See help on `idlwave-shell-mode'.<br/>See also the variable `idlwave-shell-prompt-pattern'.<br/><br/>(Type C-h m in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)
