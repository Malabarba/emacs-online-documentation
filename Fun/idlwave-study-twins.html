(idlwave-study-twins ENTRIES)<br/>
<br/>
Return dangerous twins of first entry in ENTRIES.<br/>
Dangerous twins are routines with same name, but in different files on<br/>
the load path.  If a file is in the system library and has an entry in<br/>
the `idlwave-system-routines' list, we omit the latter as<br/>
non-dangerous because many IDL routines are implemented as library<br/>
routines, and may have been scanned.
