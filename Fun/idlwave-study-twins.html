<strong>idlwave-study-twins</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(idlwave-study-twins <u>ENTRIES</u>)</br>
</br>
Return dangerous twins of first entry in <u>ENTRIES</u>.</br>
Dangerous twins are routines with same name, but in different files on</br>
the load path.  If a file is in the system library and has an entry in</br>
the `idlwave-system-routines' list, we omit the latter as</br>
non-dangerous because many IDL routines are implemented as library</br>
routines, and may have been scanned.
