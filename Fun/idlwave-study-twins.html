idlwave-study-twins is a compiled Lisp function in `idlwave.el'.<br/><br/>(idlwave-study-twins ENTRIES)<br/><br/>Return dangerous twins of first entry in ENTRIES.<br/>Dangerous twins are routines with same name, but in different files on<br/>the load path.  If a file is in the system library and has an entry in<br/>the `idlwave-system-routines' list, we omit the latter as<br/>non-dangerous because many IDL routines are implemented as library<br/>routines, and may have been scanned.
