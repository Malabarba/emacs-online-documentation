<strong>idlwave-template</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-template S1 S2 &optional PROMPT NOINDENT)<br/>
<br/>
Build a template with optional prompt expression.<br/>
<br/>
Opens a line if point is not followed by a newline modulo intervening<br/>
whitespace.  S1 and S2 are strings.  S1 is inserted at point followed<br/>
by S2.  Point is inserted between S1 and S2.  The case of S1 and S2 is<br/>
adjusted according to `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.  If optional<br/>
argument PROMPT is a string then it is displayed as a message in the<br/>
minibuffer.  The PROMPT serves as a reminder to the user of an<br/>
expression to enter.<br/>
<br/>
The lines containing S1 and S2 are reindented using `indent-region'<br/>
unless the optional second argument NOINDENT is non-nil.
