<strong>idlwave-update-routine-info</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(idlwave-update-routine-info &optional ARG NO-CONCATENATE)<br/>
<br/>
Update the internal routine-info lists.<br/>
These lists are used by `idlwave-routine-info' (M-x idlwave-routine-info)<br/>
and by `idlwave-complete' (M-x idlwave-complete) to provide information<br/>
about individual routines.<br/>
<br/>
The information can come from 4 sources:<br/>
1. IDL programs in the current editing session<br/>
2. Compiled modules in an IDL shell running as Emacs subprocess<br/>
3. A list which covers the IDL system routines.<br/>
4. A list which covers the prescanned library files.<br/>
<br/>
Scans all IDLWAVE-mode buffers of the current editing session (see<br/>
`idlwave-scan-all-buffers-for-routine-info').<br/>
When an IDL shell is running, this command also queries the IDL program<br/>
for currently compiled routines.<br/>
<br/>
With prefix ARG, also reload the system and library lists.<br/>
With two prefix ARG's, also rescans the chosen user catalog tree.<br/>
With three prefix args, dispatch asynchronous process to do the update.<br/>
<br/>
If NO-CONCATENATE is non-nil, don't pre-concatenate the routine info<br/>
lists, but instead wait for the shell query to complete and<br/>
asynchronously finish updating routine info.  This is set<br/>
automatically when called interactively.  When you need routine<br/>
information updated immediately, leave NO-CONCATENATE nil.
