</br>
</br>
(ido-find-file)</br>
</br>
Edit file with name obtained via minibuffer.</br>
The file is displayed according to `ido-default-file-method' -- the</br>
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already visible</br>
in another frame.</br>
</br>
The file name is selected interactively by typing a substring.  As you</br>
type in a string, all of the filenames matching the string are displayed</br>
if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at `ido-enable-prefix' and</br>
`ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the filename you want, it can</br>
then be selected.  As you type, most keys have their normal keybindings,</br>
except for the following: </br>
Uses keymap `ido-file-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</br>
