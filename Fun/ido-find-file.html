ido-find-file is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `ido.el'.<br/><br/>(ido-find-file)<br/><br/>Edit file with name obtained via minibuffer.<br/>The file is displayed according to `ido-default-file-method' -- the<br/>default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already<br/>visible in another frame.<br/><br/>The file name is selected interactively by typing a substring.  As you<br/>type in a string, all of the filenames matching the string are displayed<br/>if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at `ido-enable-prefix' and<br/>`ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the filename you want, it can<br/>then be selected.  As you type, most keys have their normal keybindings,<br/>except for the following: <br/>Uses keymap `ido-file-completion-map', which is not currently defined.<br/><br/><br/>RET Select the file at the front of the list of matches.  If the<br/>list is empty, possibly prompt to create new file.<br/><br/>M-x ido-select-text Use the current input string verbatim.<br/><br/>M-x ido-next-match Put the first element at the end of the list.<br/>M-x ido-prev-match Put the last element at the start of the list.<br/>M-x ido-complete Complete a common suffix to the current string that<br/>matches all files.  If there is only one match, select that file.<br/>If there is no common suffix, show a list of all matching files<br/>in a separate window.<br/>M-x ido-magic-delete-char Open the specified directory in Dired mode.<br/>M-x ido-edit-input Edit input string (including directory).<br/>M-x ido-prev-work-directory or M-x ido-next-work-directory go to previous/next directory in work directory history.<br/>M-x ido-merge-work-directories search for file in the work directory history.<br/>M-x ido-forget-work-directory removes current directory from the work directory history.<br/>M-x ido-prev-work-file or M-x ido-next-work-file cycle through the work file history.<br/>M-x ido-wide-find-file-or-pop-dir and M-x ido-wide-find-dir-or-delete-dir prompts and uses find to locate files or directories.<br/>M-x ido-make-directory prompts for a directory to create in current directory.<br/>M-x ido-fallback-command Fallback to non-ido version of current command.<br/>M-x ido-toggle-regexp Toggle regexp searching.<br/>M-x ido-toggle-prefix Toggle between substring and prefix matching.<br/>M-x ido-toggle-case Toggle case-sensitive searching of file names.<br/>M-x ido-toggle-literal Toggle literal reading of this file.<br/>M-x ido-completion-help Show list of matching files in separate window.<br/>M-x ido-toggle-ignore Toggle ignoring files listed in `ido-ignore-files'.
