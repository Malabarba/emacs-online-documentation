</br>

</br>
Return the current list of buffers.</br>
Currently visible buffers are put at the end of the list.</br>
The hook `ido-make-buffer-list-hook' is run after the list has been</br>

in this list.  If <u>DEFAULT</u> is non-nil, and corresponds to an existing buffer,</br>
it is put to the start of the list.
