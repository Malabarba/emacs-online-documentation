<strong>ido-switch-buffer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ido.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ido-switch-buffer)</br>
</br>
Switch to another buffer.</br>
The buffer is displayed according to `ido-default-buffer-method' -- the</br>
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already visible</br>
in another frame.</br>
</br>
As you type in a string, all of the buffers matching the string are</br>
displayed if substring-matching is used (default).  Look at</br>
`ido-enable-prefix' and `ido-toggle-prefix'.  When you have found the</br>
buffer you want, it can then be selected.  As you type, most keys have</br>
their normal keybindings, except for the following: </br>
Uses keymap `ido-buffer-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</br>
