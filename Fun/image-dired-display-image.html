<strong>image-dired-display-image</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>image-dired.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(image-dired-display-image FILE &optional ORIGINAL-SIZE)<br/>
<br/>
Display image FILE in image buffer.<br/>
Use this when you want to display the image, semi sized, in a new<br/>
window.  The image is sized to fit the display window (using a<br/>
temporary file, don't worry).  Because of this, it will not be as<br/>
quick as opening it directly, but on most modern systems it<br/>
should feel snappy enough.<br/>
<br/>
If optional argument ORIGINAL-SIZE is non-nil, display image in its<br/>
original size.
