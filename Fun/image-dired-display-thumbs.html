image-dired-display-thumbs is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `image-dired.el'.<br/><br/>(image-dired-display-thumbs &optional ARG APPEND DO-NOT-POP)<br/><br/>Display thumbnails of all marked files, in `image-dired-thumbnail-buffer'.<br/>If a thumbnail image does not exist for a file, it is created on the<br/>fly.  With prefix argument ARG, display only thumbnail for file at<br/>point (this is useful if you have marked some files but want to show<br/>another one).<br/><br/>Recommended usage is to split the current frame horizontally so that<br/>you have the dired buffer in the left window and the<br/>`image-dired-thumbnail-buffer' buffer in the right window.<br/><br/>With optional argument APPEND, append thumbnail to thumbnail buffer<br/>instead of erasing it first.<br/><br/>Optional argument DO-NOT-POP controls if `pop-to-buffer' should be<br/>used or not.  If non-nil, use `display-buffer' instead of<br/>`pop-to-buffer'.  This is used from functions like<br/>`image-dired-next-line-and-display' and<br/>`image-dired-previous-line-and-display' where we do not want the<br/>thumbnail buffer to be selected.
