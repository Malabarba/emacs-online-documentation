<strong>image-type</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>image.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(image-type SOURCE &optional TYPE DATA-P)<br/>
<br/>
Determine and return image type.<br/>
SOURCE is an image file name or image data.<br/>
Optional TYPE is a symbol describing the image type.  If TYPE is omitted<br/>
or nil, try to determine the image type from its first few bytes<br/>
of image data.  If that doesn't work, and SOURCE is a file name,<br/>
use its file extension as image type.<br/>
Optional DATA-P non-nil means SOURCE is a string containing image data.
