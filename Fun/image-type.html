</br>
(image-type <u>SOURCE</u> &optional <u>TYPE</u> <u>DATA-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Determine and return image type.</br>
<u>SOURCE</u> is an image file name or image data.</br>
Optional <u>TYPE</u> is a symbol describing the image type.  If <u>TYPE</u> is omitted</br>
or nil, try to determine the image type from its first few bytes</br>
of image data.  If that doesn't work, and <u>SOURCE</u> is a file name,</br>
use its file extension as image type.</br>
Optional <u>DATA-P</u> non-nil means <u>SOURCE</u> is a string containing image data.
