<strong>imagemagick-register-types</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>image.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(imagemagick-register-types)<br/>
<br/>
Register file types that can be handled by ImageMagick.<br/>
This function is called at startup, after loading the init file.<br/>
It registers the ImageMagick types returned by `imagemagick-filter-types'.<br/>
<br/>
Registered image types are added to `auto-mode-alist', so that<br/>
Emacs visits them in Image mode.  They are also added to<br/>
`image-type-file-name-regexps', so that the `image-type' function<br/>
recognizes these files as having image type `imagemagick'.<br/>
<br/>
If Emacs is compiled without ImageMagick support, this does nothing.
