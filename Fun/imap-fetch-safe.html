<strong>imap-fetch-safe</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>imap.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(imap-fetch-safe <u>UIDS</u> <u>PROPS</u> &optional <u>RECEIVE</u> <u>NOUIDFETCH</u> <u>BUFFER</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `imap-fetch', but DTRT with Exchange 2007 bug.</br>
However, <u>UIDS</u> here is a cons, where the car is the canonical form</br>
of the <u>UIDS</u> specification, and the cdr is the one which works with</br>
Exchange 2007 or, potentially, other buggy servers.</br>
See `imap-enable-exchange-bug-workaround'.
