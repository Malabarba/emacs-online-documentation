imap-remassoc is a compiled Lisp function in `imap.el'.<br/><br/>(imap-remassoc KEY ALIST)<br/><br/>Delete by side effect any elements of ALIST whose car is `equal' to KEY.<br/>The modified ALIST is returned.  If the first member<br/>of ALIST has a car that is `equal' to KEY, there is no way to remove it<br/>by side effect; therefore, write `(setq foo (remassoc key foo))' to be<br/>sure of changing the value of `foo'.
