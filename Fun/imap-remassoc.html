<strong>imap-remassoc</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>imap.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(imap-remassoc <u>KEY</u> <u>ALIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete by side effect any elements of <u>ALIST</u> whose car is `equal' to <u>KEY</u>.</br>
The modified <u>ALIST</u> is returned.  If the first member</br>
of <u>ALIST</u> has a car that is `equal' to <u>KEY</u>, there is no way to remove it</br>
by side effect; therefore, write `(setq foo (remassoc key foo))' to be</br>
sure of changing the value of `foo'.
