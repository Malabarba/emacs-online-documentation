<strong>imenu-default-create-index-function</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>imenu.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(imenu-default-create-index-function)</br>
</br>
Default function to create an index alist of the current buffer.</br>
</br>
The most general method is to move point to end of buffer, then repeatedly call</br>
`imenu-prev-index-position-function' and `imenu-extract-index-name-function'.</br>
All the results returned by the latter are gathered into an index alist.</br>
This method is used if those two variables are non-nil.</br>
</br>
The alternate method, which is the one most often used, is to call</br>
`imenu--generic-function' with `imenu-generic-expression' as argument.
