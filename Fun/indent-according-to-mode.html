<br/>
(indent-according-to-mode)<br/>
<br/>
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.<br/>
Normally, this is done by calling the function specified by the<br/>
variable `indent-line-function'.  However, if the value of that<br/>
variable is `indent-relative' or `indent-relative-maybe', handle<br/>
it specially (since those functions are used for tabbing); in<br/>
that case, indent by aligning to the previous non-blank line.
