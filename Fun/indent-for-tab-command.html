<strong>indent-for-tab-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>indent.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to TAB.</br>
</br>
<code>(indent-for-tab-command <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Indent the current line or region, or insert a tab, as appropriate.</br>
This function either inserts a tab, or indents the current line,</br>
or performs symbol completion, depending on `tab-always-indent'.</br>
The function called to actually indent the line or insert a tab</br>
is given by the variable `indent-line-function'.</br>
</br>
If a prefix argument is given, after this function indents the</br>
current line or inserts a tab, it also rigidly indents the entire</br>
balanced expression which starts at the beginning of the current</br>
line, to reflect the current line's indentation.</br>
</br>
In most major modes, if point was in the current line's</br>
indentation, it is moved to the first non-whitespace character</br>
after indenting; otherwise it stays at the same position relative</br>
to the text.</br>
</br>
If `transient-mark-mode' is turned on and the region is active,</br>
this function instead calls `indent-region'.  In this case, any</br>
prefix argument is ignored.
