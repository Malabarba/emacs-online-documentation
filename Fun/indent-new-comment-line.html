<strong>indent-new-comment-line</strong> is an alias for `comment-indent-new-line' in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-M-j, M-j.<br/>
<br/>
(indent-new-comment-line &optional SOFT)<br/>
<br/>
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if within one.<br/>
This indents the body of the continued comment<br/>
under the previous comment line.<br/>
<br/>
This command is intended for styles where you write a comment per line,<br/>
starting a new comment (and terminating it if necessary) on each line.<br/>
If you want to continue one comment across several lines, use M-x newline-and-indent.<br/>
<br/>
If a fill column is specified, it overrides the use of the comment column<br/>
or comment indentation.<br/>
<br/>
The inserted newline is marked hard if variable `use-hard-newlines' is true,<br/>
unless optional argument SOFT is non-nil.
