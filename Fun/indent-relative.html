<strong>indent-relative</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>indent.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(indent-relative &optional UNINDENTED-OK)<br/>
<br/>
Space out to under next indent point in previous nonblank line.<br/>
An indent point is a non-whitespace character following whitespace.<br/>
The following line shows the indentation points in this line.<br/>
    ^         ^    ^     ^   ^           ^      ^  ^    ^<br/>
If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond the<br/>
column point starts at, `tab-to-tab-stop' is done instead, unless<br/>
this command is invoked with a numeric argument, in which case it<br/>
does nothing.<br/>
