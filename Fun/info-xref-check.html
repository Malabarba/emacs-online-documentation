<strong>info-xref-check</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>info-xref.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(info-xref-check <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Check external references in <u>FILENAME</u>, an info document.</br>
Interactively from an `Info-mode' or `texinfo-mode' buffer the</br>
current info file is the default.</br>
</br>
Results are shown in a `compilation-mode' buffer.  The format is</br>
a bit rough, but there shouldn't be many problems normally.  The</br>
file:line:column: is the info document, but of course normally</br>
any correction should be made in the original .texi file.</br>
Finding the right place in the .texi is a manual process.</br>
</br>
When a target info file doesn't exist there's obviously no way to</br>
validate node references within it.  A message is given for</br>
missing target files once per source document.  It could be</br>
simply that you don't have the target installed, or it could be a</br>
mistake in the reference.</br>
</br>
Indirect info files are understood, just pass the top-level</br>
foo.info to `info-xref-check' and it traverses all sub-files.</br>
Compressed info files are accepted too as usual for `Info-mode'.</br>
</br>
"makeinfo" checks references internal to an info document, but</br>
not external references, which makes it rather easy for mistakes</br>
to creep in or node name changes to go unnoticed.</br>
`Info-validate' doesn't check external references either.
