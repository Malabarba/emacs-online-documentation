info-xref-docstrings is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `info-xref.el'.<br/><br/>(info-xref-docstrings FILENAME-LIST)<br/><br/>Check docstring info node references in source files.<br/>The given files are searched for docstring hyperlinks like<br/><br/>    Info node `(elisp)Documentation Tips'<br/><br/>and those links checked by attempting to visit the target nodes<br/>as per `info-xref-check' does.<br/><br/>Interactively filenames are read as a wildcard pattern like<br/>"foo*.el", with the current file as a default.  Usually this<br/>will be lisp sources, but anything with such hyperlinks can be<br/>checked, including the Emacs .c sources (or the etc/DOC file of<br/>all builtins).<br/><br/>Because info node hyperlinks are found by a simple regexp search<br/>in the files, the Lisp code checked doesn't have to be loaded,<br/>and links can be in the file commentary or elsewhere too.  Even<br/>.elc files can usually be checked successfully if you don't have<br/>the sources handy.
