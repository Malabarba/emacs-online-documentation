<strong>info-xref-with-file</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>info-xref.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(info-xref-with-file <u>FILENAME</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Evaluate <u>BODY</u> in a buffer containing the contents of <u>FILENAME</u>.</br>
If <u>FILENAME</u> is already in a buffer then that's used, otherwise a</br>
temporary buffer.</br>
</br>
The current implementation uses `insert-file-contents' rather</br>
than `find-file-noselect' so as not to be held up by queries</br>
about local variables or possible weirdness in a major mode.</br>
`lm-with-file' does a similar thing, but it sets</br>
`emacs-lisp-mode' which is not wanted here.
