<strong>info-xref-with-file</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>info-xref.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(info-xref-with-file FILENAME &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Evaluate BODY in a buffer containing the contents of FILENAME.<br/>
If FILENAME is already in a buffer then that's used, otherwise a<br/>
temporary buffer.<br/>
<br/>
The current implementation uses `insert-file-contents' rather<br/>
than `find-file-noselect' so as not to be held up by queries<br/>
about local variables or possible weirdness in a major mode.<br/>
`lm-with-file' does a similar thing, but it sets<br/>
`emacs-lisp-mode' which is not wanted here.
