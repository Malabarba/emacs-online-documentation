<strong>info-xref-with-output</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>info-xref.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(info-xref-with-output &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Run BODY with an info-xref output buffer.<br/>
This is meant to nest, so you can wrap it around a set of<br/>
different info-xref checks and have them write to the one output<br/>
buffer created by the outermost `info-xref-with-output', with an<br/>
overall good/bad count summary inserted at the very end.
