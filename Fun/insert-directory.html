insert-directory is a compiled Lisp function in `files.el'.<br/><br/>(insert-directory FILE SWITCHES &optional WILDCARD FULL-DIRECTORY-P)<br/><br/>Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.<br/>Leaves point after the inserted text.<br/>SWITCHES may be a string of options, or a list of strings.<br/>Optional third arg WILDCARD means treat FILE as shell wildcard.<br/>Optional fourth arg FULL-DIRECTORY-P means file is a directory and<br/>switches do not contain `d', so that a full listing is expected.<br/><br/>This version of the function comes from `ls-lisp.el'.<br/>If the value of `ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program' is non-nil then<br/>it works exactly like the version from `files.el' and runs a directory<br/>listing program whose name is in the variable<br/>`insert-directory-program'; if also WILDCARD is non-nil then it runs<br/>the shell specified by `shell-file-name'.  If the value of<br/>`ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program' is nil then it runs a Lisp<br/>emulation.<br/><br/>The Lisp emulation does not run any external programs or shells.  It<br/>supports ordinary shell wildcards if `ls-lisp-support-shell-wildcards'<br/>is non-nil; otherwise, it interprets wildcards as regular expressions<br/>to match file names.  It does not support all `ls' switches -- those<br/>that work are: A a B C c F G g h i n R r S s t U u X.  The l switch<br/>is assumed to be always present and cannot be turned off.
