</br>
(insert-file-contents-literally <u>FILENAME</u> &optional <u>VISIT</u> <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> <u>REPLACE</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `insert-file-contents', but only reads in the file literally.</br>
A buffer may be modified in several ways after reading into the buffer,</br>
to Emacs features such as format decoding, character code</br>
conversion, `find-file-hook', automatic uncompression, etc.</br>
</br>
This function ensures that none of these modifications will take place.
