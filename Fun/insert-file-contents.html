<strong>insert-file-contents</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(insert-file-contents FILENAME &optional VISIT BEG END REPLACE)<br/>
<br/>
Insert contents of file FILENAME after point.<br/>
Returns list of absolute file name and number of characters inserted.<br/>
If second argument VISIT is non-nil, the buffer's visited filename and<br/>
last save file modtime are set, and it is marked unmodified.  If<br/>
visiting and the file does not exist, visiting is completed before the<br/>
error is signaled.<br/>
<br/>
The optional third and fourth arguments BEG and END specify what portion<br/>
of the file to insert.  These arguments count bytes in the file, not<br/>
characters in the buffer.  If VISIT is non-nil, BEG and END must be nil.<br/>
<br/>
If optional fifth argument REPLACE is non-nil, replace the current<br/>
buffer contents (in the accessible portion) with the file contents.<br/>
This is better than simply deleting and inserting the whole thing<br/>
because (1) it preserves some marker positions and (2) it puts less data<br/>
in the undo list.  When REPLACE is non-nil, the second return value is<br/>
the number of characters that replace previous buffer contents.<br/>
<br/>
This function does code conversion according to the value of<br/>
`coding-system-for-read' or `file-coding-system-alist', and sets the<br/>
variable `last-coding-system-used' to the coding system actually used.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, this function decodes the inserted text from known formats<br/>
by calling `format-decode', which see.
