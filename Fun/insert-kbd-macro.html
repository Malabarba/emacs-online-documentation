<strong>insert-kbd-macro</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>macros.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(insert-kbd-macro <u>MACRONAME</u> &optional <u>KEYS</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro <u>MACRONAME</u>, as Lisp code.</br>
<u>MACRONAME</u> should be a symbol.</br>
Optional second arg <u>KEYS</u> means also record the keys it is on</br>
(this is the prefix argument, when calling interactively).</br>
</br>
This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same</br>
definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code</br>
will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings</br>
are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global</br>
bindings.</br>
</br>
To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',</br>
use this command, and then save the file.
