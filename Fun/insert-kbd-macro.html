insert-kbd-macro is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `macros.el'.<br/><br/>(insert-kbd-macro MACRONAME &optional KEYS)<br/><br/>Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro NAME, as Lisp code.<br/>Optional second arg KEYS means also record the keys it is on<br/>(this is the prefix argument, when calling interactively).<br/><br/>This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same<br/>definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code<br/>will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings<br/>are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global<br/>bindings.<br/><br/>To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',<br/>use this command, and then save the file.
