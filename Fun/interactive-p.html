<strong>interactive-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(interactive-p)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 23.2;<br/>
use `called-interactively-p' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Return t if the containing function was run directly by user input.<br/>
This means that the function was called with `call-interactively'<br/>
(which includes being called as the binding of a key)<br/>
and input is currently coming from the keyboard (not a keyboard macro),<br/>
and Emacs is not running in batch mode (`noninteractive' is nil).<br/>
<br/>
The only known proper use of `interactive-p' is in deciding whether to<br/>
display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're thinking<br/>
of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that you're<br/>
making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the command is<br/>
called from a keyboard macro?<br/>
<br/>
To test whether your function was called with `call-interactively',<br/>
either (i) add an extra optional argument and give it an `interactive'<br/>
spec that specifies non-nil unconditionally (such as "p"); or (ii)<br/>
use `called-interactively-p'.
