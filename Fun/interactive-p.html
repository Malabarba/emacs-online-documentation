</br>
(interactive-p)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 23.2;</br>
use `called-interactively-p' instead.</br>
</br>
Return t if the containing function was run directly by user input.</br>
This means that the function was called with `call-interactively'</br>
(which includes being called as the binding of a key)</br>
and input is currently coming from the keyboard (not a keyboard macro),</br>
and Emacs is not running in batch mode (`noninteractive' is nil).</br>
</br>
The only known proper use of `interactive-p' is in deciding whether to</br>
display a helpful message, or how to display it.  If you're thinking</br>
of using it for any other purpose, it is quite likely that you're</br>
making a mistake.  Think: what do you want to do when the command is</br>
called from a keyboard macro or in batch mode?</br>
</br>
To test whether your function was called with `call-interactively',</br>
either (i) add an extra optional argument and give it an `interactive'</br>
spec that specifies non-nil unconditionally (such as "p"); or (ii)</br>
use `called-interactively-p'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
