<strong>isearch-lazy-highlight-new-loop</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>isearch.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(isearch-lazy-highlight-new-loop &optional BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Cleanup any previous `lazy-highlight' loop and begin a new one.<br/>
BEG and END specify the bounds within which highlighting should occur.<br/>
This is called when `isearch-update' is invoked (which can cause the<br/>
search string to change or the window to scroll).  It is also used<br/>
by other Emacs features.
