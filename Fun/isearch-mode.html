<strong>isearch-mode</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>isearch.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(isearch-mode <u>FORWARD</u> &optional <u>REGEXP</u> <u>OP-FUN</u> <u>RECURSIVE-EDIT</u> <u>WORD</u>)</br>
</br>
Start Isearch minor mode.</br>
It is called by the function `isearch-forward' and other related functions.</br>
</br>
The non-nil arg <u>FORWARD</u> means searching in the forward direction.</br>
</br>
The non-nil arg <u>REGEXP</u> does an incremental regular expression search.</br>
</br>
The arg <u>OP-FUN</u> is a function to be called after each input character</br>
is processed.  (It is not called after characters that exit the search.)</br>
</br>
When the arg <u>RECURSIVE-EDIT</u> is non-nil, this function behaves modally and</br>
does not return to the calling function until the search is completed.</br>
To behave this way it enters a recursive-edit and exits it when done</br>
isearching.</br>
</br>
The arg <u>WORD</u>, if t, does incremental search for a sequence of words,</br>
ignoring punctuation.  If the value is a function, it is called to</br>
convert the search string to a regexp used by regexp search functions.
