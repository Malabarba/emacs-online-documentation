<strong>isearch-occur</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>isearch.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(isearch-occur REGEXP &optional NLINES)<br/>
<br/>
Run `occur' using the last search string as the regexp.<br/>
Interactively, REGEXP is constructed using the search string from the<br/>
last search command.  NLINES has the same meaning as in `occur'.<br/>
<br/>
If the last search command was a word search, REGEXP is computed from<br/>
the search words, ignoring punctuation.  If the last search<br/>
command was a regular expression search, REGEXP is the regular<br/>
expression used in that search.  If the last search command searched<br/>
for a literal string, REGEXP is constructed by quoting all the special<br/>
characters in that string.
