isearch-other-meta-char is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `isearch.el'.<br/><br/>(isearch-other-meta-char &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Process a miscellaneous key sequence in Isearch mode.<br/><br/>Try to convert the current key-sequence to something usable in Isearch<br/>mode, either by converting it with `function-key-map', downcasing a<br/>key with C-<upper case>, or finding a "scrolling command" bound to<br/>it.  (In the last case, we may have to read more events.)  If so,<br/>either unread the converted sequence or execute the command.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if `search-exit-option' is non-nil (the default) unread the<br/>key-sequence and exit the search normally.  If it is the symbol<br/>`edit', the search string is edited in the minibuffer and the meta<br/>character is unread so that it applies to editing the string.<br/><br/>ARG is the prefix argument.  It will be transmitted through to the<br/>scrolling command or to the command whose key-sequence exits<br/>Isearch mode.
