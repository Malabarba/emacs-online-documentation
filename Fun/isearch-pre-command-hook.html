<strong>isearch-pre-command-hook</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>isearch.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(isearch-pre-command-hook)</br>
</br>
Decide whether to exit Isearch mode before executing the command.</br>
Don't exit Isearch if the key sequence that invoked this command</br>
is bound in `isearch-mode-map', or if the invoked command is</br>
a prefix argument command (when `isearch-allow-prefix' is non-nil),</br>
or it is a scrolling command (when `isearch-allow-scroll' is non-nil).</br>
Otherwise, exit Isearch (when `search-exit-option' is non-nil)</br>
before the command is executed globally with terminated Isearch.
