<br/>
(ispell-adjusted-window-height &optional WINDOW)<br/>
<br/>
Like `window-height', adjusted to correct for the effect of tall mode-lines.<br/>
The value returned is actually the nominal number of text-lines in the<br/>
window plus 1.  On a terminal, this is the same value returned by<br/>
`window-height', but if the window has a mode-line is taller than a normal<br/>
text line, the returned value may be smaller than that from<br/>
`window-height'.
