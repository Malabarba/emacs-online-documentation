<strong>ispell-get-word</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ispell.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ispell-get-word <u>FOLLOWING</u> &optional <u>EXTRA-OTHERCHARS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the word for spell-checking according to ispell syntax.</br>
If optional argument <u>FOLLOWING</u> is non-nil or if `ispell-following-word'</br>
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word</br>
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.</br>
Optional second argument contains otherchars that can be included in word</br>
many times (see the doc string of `ispell-dictionary-alist' for details</br>
about otherchars).</br>
</br>
Word syntax is controlled by the definition of the chosen dictionary,</br>
which is in `ispell-local-dictionary-alist' or `ispell-dictionary-alist'.
