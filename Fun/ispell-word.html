<strong>ispell-word</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ispell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to M-$, <menu-bar> <tools> <spell> <ispell-word>.<br/>
<br/>
(ispell-word &optional FOLLOWING QUIETLY CONTINUE REGION)<br/>
<br/>
Check spelling of word under or before the cursor.<br/>
If the word is not found in dictionary, display possible corrections<br/>
in a window allowing you to choose one.<br/>
<br/>
If optional argument FOLLOWING is non-nil or if `ispell-following-word'<br/>
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word<br/>
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.<br/>
When the optional argument QUIETLY is non-nil or `ispell-quietly' is non-nil<br/>
when called interactively, non-corrective messages are suppressed.<br/>
<br/>
With a prefix argument (or if CONTINUE is non-nil),<br/>
resume interrupted spell-checking of a buffer or region.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, call<br/>
`ispell-region' to check the active region for spelling errors.<br/>
<br/>
Word syntax is controlled by the definition of the chosen dictionary,<br/>
which is in `ispell-local-dictionary-alist' or `ispell-dictionary-alist'.<br/>
<br/>
This will check or reload the dictionary.  Use M-x ispell-change-dictionary<br/>
or M-x ispell-region to update the Ispell process.<br/>
<br/>
Return values:<br/>
nil           word is correct or spelling is accepted.<br/>
0             word is inserted into buffer-local definitions.<br/>
"word"        word corrected from word list.<br/>
("word" arg)  word is hand entered.<br/>
quit          spell session exited.
