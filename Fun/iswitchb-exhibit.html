<strong>iswitchb-exhibit</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>iswitchb.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(iswitchb-exhibit)</br>
</br>
Find matching buffers and display a list in the minibuffer.</br>
Copied from `icomplete-exhibit' with two changes:</br>
1. It prints a default buffer name when there is no text yet entered.</br>
2. It calls my completion routine rather than the standard completion.
