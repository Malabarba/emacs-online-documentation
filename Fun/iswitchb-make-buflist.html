Set `iswitchb-buflist' to the current list of buffers.<br/>
Currently visible buffers are put at the end of the list.<br/>
The hook `iswitchb-make-buflist-hook' is run after the list has been<br/>
created to allow the user to further modify the order of the buffer names<br/>
in this list.  If DEFAULT is non-nil, and corresponds to an existing buffer,<br/>
it is put to the start of the list.
