<br/>
(iswitchb)<br/>
<br/>
Switch to buffer matching a substring.<br/>
As you type in a string, all of the buffers matching the string are<br/>
displayed.  When you have found the buffer you want, it can then be<br/>
selected.  As you type, most keys have their normal keybindings,<br/>
except for the following:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RET Select the buffer at the front of the list of matches.  If the<br/>
list is empty, possibly prompt to create new buffer.<br/>
<br/>
C-j Select the current prompt as the buffer.<br/>
If no buffer is found, prompt for a new one.<br/>
<br/>
C-s Put the first element at the end of the list.<br/>
C-r Put the last element at the start of the list.<br/>
TAB Complete a common suffix to the current string that<br/>
matches all buffers.  If there is only one match, select that buffer.<br/>
If there is no common suffix, show a list of all matching buffers<br/>
in a separate window.<br/>
C-t Toggle regexp searching.<br/>
C-c Toggle case-sensitive searching of buffer names.<br/>
? Show list of matching buffers in separate window.<br/>
C-x C-f Exit iswitchb and drop into `find-file'.<br/>
C-k Kill buffer at head of buffer list.
