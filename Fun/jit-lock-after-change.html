<strong>jit-lock-after-change</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>jit-lock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(jit-lock-after-change <u>START</u> <u>END</u> <u>OLD-LEN</u>)</br>
</br>
Mark the rest of the buffer as not fontified after a change.</br>
Installed on `after-change-functions'.</br>
<u>START</u> and <u>END</u> are the start and end of the changed text.  <u>OLD-LEN</u></br>
is the pre-change length.</br>
This function ensures that lines following the change will be refontified</br>
in case the syntax of those lines has changed.  Refontification</br>
will take place when text is fontified stealthily.
