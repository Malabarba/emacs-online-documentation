<strong>jit-lock-debug-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>jit-lock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(jit-lock-debug-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Minor mode to help debug code run from jit-lock.</br>
When this minor mode is enabled, jit-lock runs as little code as possible</br>
during redisplay and moves the rest to a timer, where things</br>
like `debug-on-error' and Edebug can be used.
