<strong>jit-lock-mode</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>jit-lock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(jit-lock-mode ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle Just-in-time Lock mode.<br/>
Turn Just-in-time Lock mode on if and only if ARG is non-nil.<br/>
Enable it automatically by customizing group `font-lock'.<br/>
<br/>
When Just-in-time Lock mode is enabled, fontification is different in the<br/>
following ways:<br/>
<br/>
- Demand-driven buffer fontification triggered by Emacs C code.<br/>
  This means initial fontification of the whole buffer does not occur.<br/>
  Instead, fontification occurs when necessary, such as when scrolling<br/>
  through the buffer would otherwise reveal unfontified areas.  This is<br/>
  useful if buffer fontification is too slow for large buffers.<br/>
<br/>
- Stealthy buffer fontification if `jit-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.<br/>
  This means remaining unfontified areas of buffers are fontified if Emacs has<br/>
  been idle for `jit-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.<br/>
  This is useful if any buffer has any deferred fontification.<br/>
<br/>
- Deferred context fontification if `jit-lock-contextually' is<br/>
  non-nil.  This means fontification updates the buffer corresponding to<br/>
  true syntactic context, after `jit-lock-context-time' seconds of Emacs<br/>
  idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  Otherwise, fontification occurs<br/>
  on modified lines only, and subsequent lines can remain fontified<br/>
  corresponding to previous syntactic contexts.  This is useful where<br/>
  strings or comments span lines.<br/>
<br/>
Stealth fontification only occurs while the system remains unloaded.<br/>
If the system load rises above `jit-lock-stealth-load' percent, stealth<br/>
fontification is suspended.  Stealth fontification intensity is controlled via<br/>
the variable `jit-lock-stealth-nice'.
