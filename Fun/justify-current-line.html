<strong>justify-current-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>fill.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(justify-current-line &optional <u>HOW</u> <u>EOP</u> <u>NOSQUEEZE</u>)</br>
</br>
Do some kind of justification on this line.</br>
Normally does full justification: adds spaces to the line to make it end at</br>
the column given by `current-fill-column'.</br>
Optional first argument <u>HOW</u> specifies alternate type of justification:</br>
it can be `left', `right', `full', `center', or `none'.</br>
If <u>HOW</u> is t, will justify however the `current-justification' function says to.</br>
If <u>HOW</u> is nil or missing, full justification is done by default.</br>
Second arg <u>EOP</u> non-nil means that this is the last line of the paragraph, so</br>
it will not be stretched by full justification.</br>
Third arg <u>NOSQUEEZE</u> non-nil means to leave interior whitespace unchanged,</br>
otherwise it is made canonical.
