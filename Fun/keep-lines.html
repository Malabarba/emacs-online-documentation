</br>
</br>
(keep-lines <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>RSTART</u> <u>REND</u> <u>INTERACTIVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete all lines except those containing matches for <u>REGEXP</u>.</br>
A match split across lines preserves all the lines it lies in.</br>
When called from Lisp (and usually interactively as well, see below)</br>
applies to all lines starting after point.</br>
</br>
If <u>REGEXP</u> contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\')</br>
and `search-upper-case' is non-nil, the matching is case-sensitive.</br>
</br>
Second and third arg <u>RSTART</u> and <u>REND</u> specify the region to operate on.</br>
This command operates on (the accessible part of) all lines whose</br>
accessible part is entirely contained in the region determined by <u>RSTART</u></br>
and <u>REND</u>.  (A newline ending a line counts as part of that line.)</br>
</br>
Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate</br>
on all lines whose accessible part is entirely contained in the region.</br>
Otherwise, the command applies to all lines starting after point.</br>
When calling this function from Lisp, you can pretend that it was</br>
called interactively by passing a non-nil <u>INTERACTIVE</u> argument.</br>
</br>
This function starts looking for the next match from the end of</br>
the previous match.  Hence, it ignores matches that overlap</br>
a previously found match.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
