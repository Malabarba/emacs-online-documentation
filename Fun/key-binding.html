<strong>key-binding</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(key-binding <u>KEY</u> &optional <u>ACCEPT-DEFAULT</u> <u>NO-REMAP</u> <u>POSITION</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the binding for command <u>KEY</u> in current keymaps.</br>
<u>KEY</u> is a string or vector, a sequence of keystrokes.</br>
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.</br>
</br>
Normally, `key-binding' ignores bindings for t, which act as default</br>
bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it</br>
usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the</br>
optional second argument <u>ACCEPT-DEFAULT</u> is non-nil, `key-binding' does</br>
recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.</br>
</br>
Like the normal command loop, `key-binding' will remap the command</br>
resulting from looking up <u>KEY</u> by looking up the command in the</br>
current keymaps.  However, if the optional third argument <u>NO-REMAP</u></br>
is non-nil, `key-binding' returns the unmapped command.</br>
</br>
If <u>KEY</u> is a key sequence initiated with the mouse, the used keymaps</br>
will depend on the clicked mouse position with regard to the buffer</br>
and possible local keymaps on strings.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>POSITION</u> is non-nil, it specifies a mouse</br>
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the lookup</br>
occurs in the keymaps associated with it instead of <u>KEY</u>.  It can also</br>
be a number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the</br>
specified buffer position instead of point are used.
