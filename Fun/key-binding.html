key-binding is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(key-binding KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT NO-REMAP POSITION)<br/><br/>Return the binding for command KEY in current keymaps.<br/>KEY is a string or vector, a sequence of keystrokes.<br/>The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.<br/><br/>Normally, `key-binding' ignores bindings for t, which act as default<br/>bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it<br/>usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the<br/>optional second argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, `key-binding' does<br/>recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.<br/><br/>Like the normal command loop, `key-binding' will remap the command<br/>resulting from looking up KEY by looking up the command in the<br/>current keymaps.  However, if the optional third argument NO-REMAP<br/>is non-nil, `key-binding' returns the unmapped command.<br/><br/>If KEY is a key sequence initiated with the mouse, the used keymaps<br/>will depend on the clicked mouse position with regard to the buffer<br/>and possible local keymaps on strings.<br/><br/>If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse<br/>position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the lookup<br/>occurs in the keymaps associated with it instead of KEY.  It can also<br/>be a number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the<br/>specified buffer position instead of point are used.
