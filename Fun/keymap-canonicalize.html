<strong>keymap-canonicalize</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(keymap-canonicalize <u>MAP</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a simpler equivalent keymap.</br>
This resolves inheritance and redefinitions.  The returned keymap</br>
should behave identically to a copy of KEYMAP w.r.t `lookup-key'</br>
and use in active keymaps and menus.</br>
Subkeymaps may be modified but are not canonicalized.
