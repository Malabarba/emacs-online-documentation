<strong>kill-buffer</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x k.<br/>
<br/>
(kill-buffer &optional BUFFER-OR-NAME)<br/>
<br/>
Kill the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME.<br/>
The argument may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.<br/>
Argument nil or omitted means kill the current buffer.  Return t if the<br/>
buffer is actually killed, nil otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
The functions in `kill-buffer-query-functions' are called with the<br/>
buffer to be killed as the current buffer.  If any of them returns nil,<br/>
the buffer is not killed.  The hook `kill-buffer-hook' is run before the<br/>
buffer is actually killed.  The buffer being killed will be current<br/>
while the hook is running.  Functions called by any of these hooks are<br/>
supposed to not change the current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Any processes that have this buffer as the `process-buffer' are killed<br/>
with SIGHUP.  This function calls `replace-buffer-in-windows' for<br/>
cleaning up all windows currently displaying the buffer to be killed.
