<strong>kill-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-k, &lt;deleteline>.</br>
</br>
<code>(kill-line <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Kill the rest of the current line; if no nonblanks there, kill thru newline.</br>
With prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, kill that many lines from point.</br>
Negative arguments kill lines backward.</br>
With zero argument, kills the text before point on the current line.</br>
</br>
When calling from a program, nil means "no arg",</br>
a number counts as a prefix arg.</br>
</br>
To kill a whole line, when point is not at the beginning, type C-a C-k C-k.</br>
</br>
If `show-trailing-whitespace' is non-nil, this command will just</br>
kill the rest of the current line, even if there are only</br>
nonblanks there.</br>
</br>
If option `kill-whole-line' is non-nil, then this command kills the whole line</br>
including its terminating newline, when used at the beginning of a line</br>
with no argument.  As a consequence, you can always kill a whole line</br>
by typing C-a C-k.</br>
</br>
If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,</br>
use C-M-w before C-k.</br>
</br>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting</br>
the line, but put the line in the kill ring anyway.  This means that</br>
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.</br>
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't</br>
even beep.)
