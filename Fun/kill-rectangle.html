<strong>kill-rectangle</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>rect.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x r k.<br/>
<br/>
(kill-rectangle START END &optional FILL)<br/>
<br/>
Delete the region-rectangle and save it as the last killed one.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a program the rectangle's corners are START and END.<br/>
You might prefer to use `delete-extract-rectangle' from a program.<br/>
<br/>
With a prefix (or a FILL) argument, also fill lines where nothing has to be<br/>
deleted.<br/>
<br/>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting<br/>
the rectangle, but put it in the kill ring anyway.  This means that<br/>
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.<br/>
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't<br/>
even beep.)
