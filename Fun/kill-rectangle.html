<strong>kill-rectangle</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>rect.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x r k.</br>
</br>
<code>(kill-rectangle <u>START</u> <u>END</u> <em>&optional</em> <u>FILL</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Delete the region-rectangle and save it as the last killed one.</br>
</br>
When called from a program the rectangle's corners are <u>START</u> and <u>END</u>.</br>
You might prefer to use `delete-extract-rectangle' from a program.</br>
</br>
With a prefix (or a <u>FILL</u>) argument, also fill lines where nothing has to be</br>
deleted.</br>
</br>
If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting</br>
the rectangle, but put it in the kill ring anyway.  This means that</br>
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.</br>
(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't</br>
even beep.)
