<strong>kill-ring-save</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <C-insertchar>, <C-insert>, M-w, <menu-bar> <edit> <copy>.<br/>
<br/>
(kill-ring-save BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.<br/>
In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.<br/>
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window<br/>
system cut and paste.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,<br/>
use C-M-w before M-w.<br/>
<br/>
This command is similar to `copy-region-as-kill', except that it gives<br/>
visual feedback indicating the extent of the region being copied.
