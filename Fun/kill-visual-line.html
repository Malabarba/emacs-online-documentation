kill-visual-line is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>(kill-visual-line &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Kill the rest of the visual line.<br/>With prefix argument ARG, kill that many visual lines from point.<br/>If ARG is negative, kill visual lines backward.<br/>If ARG is zero, kill the text before point on the current visual<br/>line.<br/><br/>If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,<br/>use C-M-w before C-k.<br/><br/>If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting<br/>the line, but put the line in the kill ring anyway.  This means that<br/>you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.<br/>(If the variable `kill-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't<br/>even beep.)
