<strong>kill-whole-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <C-S-backspace>.<br/>
<br/>
(kill-whole-line &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Kill current line.<br/>
With prefix ARG, kill that many lines starting from the current line.<br/>
If ARG is negative, kill backward.  Also kill the preceding newline.<br/>
(This is meant to make C-x z work well with negative arguments.)<br/>
If ARG is zero, kill current line but exclude the trailing newline.
