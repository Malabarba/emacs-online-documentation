<strong>kill-whole-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;C-S-backspace>.</br>
</br>
<code>(kill-whole-line <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Kill current line.</br>
With prefix <u>ARG</u>, kill that many lines starting from the current line.</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is negative, kill backward.  Also kill the preceding newline.</br>
(This is meant to make C-x z work well with negative arguments.)</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is zero, kill current line but exclude the trailing newline.
