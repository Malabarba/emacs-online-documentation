`Kinsoku' processing is to prohibit specific characters to be placed<br/>
at beginning of line or at end of line.  Characters not to be placed<br/>
at beginning and end of line have character category `>' and `<'<br/>
respectively.  This restriction is dissolved by making a line longer or<br/>
shorter.<br/>

in one place, and is used for the text processing described above in<br/>
the context of text formatting.
