</br>
Go to a line breaking position near point by doing `kinsoku' processing.</br>
<u>LINEBEG</u> is a buffer position we can't break a line before.</br>
</br>
`Kinsoku' processing is to prohibit specific characters to be placed</br>
at beginning of line or at end of line.  Characters not to be placed</br>
at beginning and end of line have character category `>' and `&lt;'</br>
respectively.  This restriction is dissolved by making a line longer or</br>
shorter.</br>
</br>
`Kinsoku' is a Japanese word which originally means ordering to stay</br>
in one place, and is used for the text processing described above in</br>
the context of text formatting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
