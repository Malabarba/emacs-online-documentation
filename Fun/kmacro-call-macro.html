<strong>kmacro-call-macro</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>kmacro.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(kmacro-call-macro ARG &optional NO-REPEAT END-MACRO)<br/>
<br/>
Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with C-x (.<br/>
A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until error.<br/>
<br/>
When you call the macro, you can call the macro again by repeating<br/>
just the last key in the key sequence that you used to call this<br/>
command.  See `kmacro-call-repeat-key' and `kmacro-call-repeat-with-arg'<br/>
for details on how to adjust or disable this behavior.<br/>
<br/>
To make a macro permanent so you can call it even after defining<br/>
others, use C-x C-k n.
