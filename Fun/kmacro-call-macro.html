<strong>kmacro-call-macro</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>kmacro.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(kmacro-call-macro <u>ARG</u> &optional <u>NO-REPEAT</u> <u>END-MACRO</u> <u>MACRO</u>)</br>
</br>
Call the keyboard <u>MACRO</u> that you defined with C-x (.</br>
A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until error.</br>
<u>MACRO</u> defaults to `last-kbd-macro'.</br>
</br>
When you call the macro, you can call the macro again by repeating</br>
just the last key in the key sequence that you used to call this</br>
command.  See `kmacro-call-repeat-key' and `kmacro-call-repeat-with-arg'</br>
for details on how to adjust or disable this behavior.</br>
</br>
To make a macro permanent so you can call it even after defining</br>
others, use C-x C-k n.
