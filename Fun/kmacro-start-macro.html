<strong>kmacro-start-macro</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>kmacro.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x (, C-x C-k C-s, C-x C-k s.</br>
</br>
<code>(kmacro-start-macro <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Record subsequent keyboard input, defining a keyboard macro.</br>
The commands are recorded even as they are executed.</br>
Use C-x ) to finish recording and make the macro available.</br>
Use C-x e to execute the macro.</br>
</br>
Non-nil arg (prefix arg) means append to last macro defined.</br>
</br>
With C-u prefix, append to last keyboard macro</br>
defined.  Depending on `kmacro-execute-before-append', this may begin</br>
by re-executing the last macro as if you typed it again.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, it sets `kmacro-counter' to <u>ARG</u> or 0 if missing before</br>
defining the macro.</br>
</br>
Use C-x C-k TAB to insert (and increment) the macro counter.</br>
The counter value can be set or modified via C-x C-k C-c and C-x C-k C-a.</br>
The format of the counter can be modified via C-x C-k C-f.</br>
</br>
Use C-x C-k n to give it a permanent name.</br>
Use C-x C-k b to bind it to a key sequence.
