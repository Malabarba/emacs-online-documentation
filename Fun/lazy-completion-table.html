<strong>lazy-completion-table</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(lazy-completion-table <u>VAR</u> <u>FUN</u>)</br>
</br>
Initialize variable <u>VAR</u> as a lazy completion table.</br>
If the completion table <u>VAR</u> is used for the first time (e.g., by passing <u>VAR</u></br>
as an argument to `try-completion'), the function <u>FUN</u> is called with no</br>
arguments.  <u>FUN</u> must return the completion table that will be stored in <u>VAR</u>.</br>
If completion is requested in the minibuffer, <u>FUN</u> will be called in the buffer</br>
from which the minibuffer was entered.  The return value of</br>
`lazy-completion-table' must be used to initialize the value of <u>VAR</u>.</br>
</br>
You should give <u>VAR</u> a non-nil `risky-local-variable' property.
