<strong>lazy-completion-table</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(lazy-completion-table VAR FUN)<br/>
<br/>
Initialize variable VAR as a lazy completion table.<br/>
If the completion table VAR is used for the first time (e.g., by passing VAR<br/>
as an argument to `try-completion'), the function FUN is called with no<br/>
arguments.  FUN must return the completion table that will be stored in VAR.<br/>
If completion is requested in the minibuffer, FUN will be called in the buffer<br/>
from which the minibuffer was entered.  The return value of<br/>
`lazy-completion-table' must be used to initialize the value of VAR.<br/>
<br/>
You should give VAR a non-nil `risky-local-variable' property.
