<strong>ldap-search-internal</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ldap.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ldap-search-internal <u>SEARCH-PLIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Perform a search on a LDAP server.</br>
<u>SEARCH-PLIST</u> is a property list describing the search request.</br>
Valid keys in that list are:</br>
</br>
  `auth-source', if non-nil, will use `auth-source-search' and</br>
will grab the :host, :secret, :base, and (:user or :binddn)</br>
tokens into the `host', `passwd', `base', and `binddn' parameters</br>
respectively if they are not provided in <u>SEARCH-PLIST</u>.  So for</br>
instance *each* of these netrc lines has the same effect if you</br>
ask for the host "ldapserver:2400":</br>
</br>
  machine ldapserver:2400 login myDN secret myPassword base myBase</br>
  machine ldapserver:2400 binddn myDN secret myPassword port ldap</br>
  login myDN secret myPassword base myBase</br>
</br>
but if you have more than one in your netrc file, only the first</br>
matching one will be used.  Note the "port ldap" part is NOT</br>
required.</br>
</br>
  `host' is a string naming one or more (blank-separated) LDAP servers</br>
to try to connect to.  Each host name may optionally be of the form HOST:PORT.</br>
  `filter' is a filter string for the search as described in RFC 1558.</br>
  `attributes' is a list of strings indicating which attributes to retrieve</br>
for each matching entry. If nil, return all available attributes.</br>
  `attrsonly', if non-nil, indicates that only attributes are retrieved,</br>
not their associated values.</br>
  `auth' is one of the symbols `simple', `krbv41' or `krbv42'.</br>
  `base' is the base for the search as described in RFC 1779.</br>
  `scope' is one of the three symbols `sub', `base' or `one'.</br>
  `binddn' is the distinguished name of the user to bind as (in RFC 1779 syntax).</br>
  `auth' is one of the symbols `simple', `krbv41' or `krbv42'</br>
  `passwd' is the password to use for simple authentication.</br>
  `deref' is one of the symbols `never', `always', `search' or `find'.</br>
  `timelimit' is the timeout limit for the connection in seconds.</br>
  `sizelimit' is the maximum number of matches to return.</br>
  `withdn' if non-nil each entry in the result will be prepended with</br>
its distinguished name DN.</br>
The function returns a list of matching entries.  Each entry is itself</br>
an alist of attribute/value pairs.
