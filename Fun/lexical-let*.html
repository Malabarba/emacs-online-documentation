<strong>lexical-let*</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cl.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(lexical-let* <u>BINDINGS</u> <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Like `let*', but lexically scoped.</br>
The main visible difference is that lambdas inside <u>BODY</u>, and in</br>
successive bindings within <u>BINDINGS</u>, will create lexical closures</br>
as in Common Lisp.  This is similar to the behavior of `let*' in</br>
Common Lisp.
