<strong>lexical-let*</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>cl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(lexical-let* BINDINGS BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Like `let*', but lexically scoped.<br/>
The main visible difference is that lambdas inside BODY, and in<br/>
successive bindings within BINDINGS, will create lexical closures<br/>
as in Common Lisp.  This is similar to the behavior of `let*' in<br/>
Common Lisp.
