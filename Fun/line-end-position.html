<strong>line-end-position</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(line-end-position &optional <u>N</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the character position of the last character on the current line.</br>
With argument <u>N</u> not nil or 1, move forward <u>N</u> - 1 lines first.</br>
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.</br>
</br>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the</br>
position of the last character in logical order, i.e. the largest</br>
character position on the line.</br>
</br>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field</br>
unless that would be on a different line than the original,</br>
unconstrained result.  If <u>N</u> is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends</br>
at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field</br>
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.</br>
</br>
This function does not move point.
