<strong>lisp-complete-symbol</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>lisp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(lisp-complete-symbol &optional PREDICATE)<br/>
<br/>
Perform completion on Lisp symbol preceding point.<br/>
Compare that symbol against the known Lisp symbols.<br/>
If no characters can be completed, display a list of possible completions.<br/>
Repeating the command at that point scrolls the list.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a program, optional arg PREDICATE is a predicate<br/>
determining which symbols are considered, e.g. `commandp'.<br/>
If PREDICATE is nil, the context determines which symbols are<br/>
considered.  If the symbol starts just after an open-parenthesis, only<br/>
symbols with function definitions are considered.  Otherwise, all<br/>
symbols with function definitions, values or properties are<br/>
considered.
