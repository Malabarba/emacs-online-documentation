<strong>list-hebrew-diary-entries</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="diary-hebrew-list-entries">diary-hebrew-list-entries</a></strong>' in `<code>cal-hebrew.el</code>'.</br>

(list-hebrew-diary-entries)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 23.1;</br>
use `diary-hebrew-list-entries' instead.</br>
</br>
Add any Hebrew date entries from the diary file to `diary-entries-list'.</br>
Hebrew date diary entries must be prefaced by `diary-hebrew-entry-symbol'</br>
(normally an `H').  The same diary date forms govern the style</br>
of the Hebrew calendar entries, except that the Hebrew month</br>
names cannot be abbreviated.  The Hebrew months are numbered</br>
from 1 to 13 with Nisan being 1, 12 being Adar I and 13 being</br>
Adar II; you must use `Adar I' if you want Adar of a common</br>
Hebrew year.  If a Hebrew date diary entry begins with</br>
`diary-nonmarking-symbol', the entry will appear in the diary</br>
listing, but will not be marked in the calendar.  This function</br>
is provided for use with `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook'.
