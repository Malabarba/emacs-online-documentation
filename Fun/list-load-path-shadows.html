<strong>list-load-path-shadows</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>shadow.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(list-load-path-shadows &optional STRINGP)<br/>
<br/>
Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.<br/>
<br/>
If STRINGP is non-nil, returns any shadows as a string.<br/>
Otherwise, if interactive shows any shadows in a `*Shadows*' buffer;<br/>
else prints messages listing any shadows.<br/>
<br/>
This function lists potential load path problems.  Directories in<br/>
the `load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp<br/>
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a<br/>
message is displayed indicating that the later file is "hidden" by<br/>
the earlier.<br/>
<br/>
For example, suppose `load-path' is set to<br/>
<br/>
("/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp" "/usr/gnu/emacs/share/emacs/19.30/lisp")<br/>
<br/>
and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then<br/>
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:<br/>
(require 'XXX), (autoload .... "XXX"), (load-library "XXX") etc.<br/>
<br/>
The first XXX.el file prevents Emacs from seeing the second (unless<br/>
the second is loaded explicitly via `load-file').<br/>
<br/>
When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle<br/>
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the<br/>
XXX package was not distributed with versions of Emacs prior to<br/>
19.30.  An Emacs maintainer downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed<br/>
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the Emacs distribution.<br/>
Unless the Emacs maintainer checks for this, the new version of XXX<br/>
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new<br/>
Emacs version).<br/>
<br/>
This function performs these checks and flags all possible<br/>
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc<br/>
(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file<br/>
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is<br/>
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.<br/>
<br/>
Shadowings are located by calling the (non-interactive) companion<br/>
function, `load-path-shadows-find'.
