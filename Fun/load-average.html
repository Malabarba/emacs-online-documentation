<strong>load-average</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(load-average &optional <u>USE-FLOATS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return list of 1 minute, 5 minute and 15 minute load averages.</br>
</br>
Each of the three load averages is multiplied by 100, then converted</br>
to integer.</br>
</br>
When <u>USE-FLOATS</u> is non-nil, floats will be used instead of integers.</br>
These floats are not multiplied by 100.</br>
</br>
If the 5-minute or 15-minute load averages are not available, return a</br>
shortened list, containing only those averages which are available.</br>
</br>
An error is thrown if the load average can't be obtained.  In some</br>
cases making it work would require Emacs being installed setuid or</br>
setgid so that it can read kernel information, and that usually isn't</br>
advisable.
