load-theme is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `custom.el'.<br/><br/>(load-theme THEME &optional NO-CONFIRM NO-ENABLE)<br/><br/>Load Custom theme named THEME from its file.<br/>The theme file is named THEME-theme.el, in one of the directories<br/>specified by `custom-theme-load-path'.<br/><br/>If the theme is not considered safe by `custom-safe-themes',<br/>prompt the user for confirmation before loading it.  But if<br/>optional arg NO-CONFIRM is non-nil, load the theme without<br/>prompting.<br/><br/>Normally, this function also enables THEME.  If optional arg<br/>NO-ENABLE is non-nil, load the theme but don't enable it, unless<br/>the theme was already enabled.<br/><br/>This function is normally called through Customize when setting<br/>`custom-enabled-themes'.  If used directly in your init file, it<br/>should be called with a non-nil NO-CONFIRM argument, or after<br/>`custom-safe-themes' has been loaded.<br/><br/>Return t if THEME was successfully loaded, nil otherwise.
