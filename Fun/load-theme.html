<strong>load-theme</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>custom.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(load-theme <u>THEME</u> &optional <u>NO-CONFIRM</u> <u>NO-ENABLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Load Custom theme named <u>THEME</u> from its file.</br>
The theme file is named <u>THEME</u>-theme.el, in one of the directories</br>
specified by `custom-theme-load-path'.</br>
</br>
If the theme is not considered safe by `custom-safe-themes',</br>
prompt the user for confirmation before loading it.  But if</br>
optional arg <u>NO-CONFIRM</u> is non-nil, load the theme without</br>
prompting.</br>
</br>
Normally, this function also enables <u>THEME</u>.  If optional arg</br>
<u>NO-ENABLE</u> is non-nil, load the theme but don't enable it, unless</br>
the theme was already enabled.</br>
</br>
This function is normally called through Customize when setting</br>
`custom-enabled-themes'.  If used directly in your init file, it</br>
should be called with a non-nil <u>NO-CONFIRM</u> argument, or after</br>
`custom-safe-themes' has been loaded.</br>
</br>
Return t if <u>THEME</u> was successfully loaded, nil otherwise.
