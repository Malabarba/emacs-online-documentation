load is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(load FILE &optional NOERROR NOMESSAGE NOSUFFIX MUST-SUFFIX)<br/><br/>Execute a file of Lisp code named FILE.<br/>First try FILE with `.elc' appended, then try with `.el',<br/>then try FILE unmodified (the exact suffixes in the exact order are<br/>determined by `load-suffixes').  Environment variable references in<br/>FILE are replaced with their values by calling `substitute-in-file-name'.<br/>This function searches the directories in `load-path'.<br/><br/>If optional second arg NOERROR is non-nil,<br/>report no error if FILE doesn't exist.<br/>Print messages at start and end of loading unless<br/>optional third arg NOMESSAGE is non-nil (but `force-load-messages'<br/>overrides that).<br/>If optional fourth arg NOSUFFIX is non-nil, don't try adding<br/>suffixes `.elc' or `.el' to the specified name FILE.<br/>If optional fifth arg MUST-SUFFIX is non-nil, insist on<br/>the suffix `.elc' or `.el'; don't accept just FILE unless<br/>it ends in one of those suffixes or includes a directory name.<br/><br/>If NOSUFFIX is nil, then if a file could not be found, try looking for<br/>a different representation of the file by adding non-empty suffixes to<br/>its name, before trying another file.  Emacs uses this feature to find<br/>compressed versions of files when Auto Compression mode is enabled.<br/>If NOSUFFIX is non-nil, disable this feature.<br/><br/>The suffixes that this function tries out, when NOSUFFIX is nil, are<br/>given by the return value of `get-load-suffixes' and the values listed<br/>in `load-file-rep-suffixes'.  If MUST-SUFFIX is non-nil, only the<br/>return value of `get-load-suffixes' is used, i.e. the file name is<br/>required to have a non-empty suffix.<br/><br/>Loading a file records its definitions, and its `provide' and<br/>`require' calls, in an element of `load-history' whose<br/>car is the file name loaded.  See `load-history'.<br/><br/>While the file is in the process of being loaded, the variable<br/>`load-in-progress' is non-nil and the variable `load-file-name'<br/>is bound to the file's name.<br/><br/>Return t if the file exists and loads successfully.
