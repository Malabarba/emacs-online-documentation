<strong>local-set-key</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(local-set-key <u>KEY</u> <u>COMMAND</u>)</br>
</br>
Give <u>KEY</u> a local binding as <u>COMMAND</u>.</br>
<u>COMMAND</u> is the command definition to use; usually it is</br>
a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.</br>
<u>KEY</u> is a key sequence; noninteractively, it is a string or vector</br>
of characters or event types, and non-ASCII characters with codes</br>
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.</br>
</br>
The binding goes in the current buffer's local map, which in most</br>
cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode.
