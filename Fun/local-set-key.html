<strong>local-set-key</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(local-set-key KEY COMMAND)<br/>
<br/>
Give KEY a local binding as COMMAND.<br/>
COMMAND is the command definition to use; usually it is<br/>
a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.<br/>
KEY is a key sequence; noninteractively, it is a string or vector<br/>
of characters or event types, and non-ASCII characters with codes<br/>
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.<br/>
<br/>
The binding goes in the current buffer's local map,<br/>
which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode.
