locale-charset-to-coding-system is a compiled Lisp function in `mule-cmds.el'.<br/><br/>(locale-charset-to-coding-system CHARSET)<br/><br/>Find coding system corresponding to CHARSET.<br/>CHARSET is any sort of non-Emacs charset name, such as might be used<br/>in a locale codeset, or elsewhere.  It is matched to a coding system<br/>first by case-insensitive lookup in `locale-charset-alist'.  Then<br/>matches are looked for in the coding system list, treating case and<br/>the characters `-' and `_' as insignificant.  The coding system base<br/>is returned.  Thus, for instance, if charset "ISO8859-2",<br/>`iso-latin-2' is returned.
