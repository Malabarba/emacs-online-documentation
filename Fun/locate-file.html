<strong>locate-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(locate-file FILENAME PATH &optional SUFFIXES PREDICATE)<br/>
<br/>
Search for FILENAME through PATH.<br/>
If found, return the absolute file name of FILENAME, with its suffixes;<br/>
otherwise return nil.<br/>
PATH should be a list of directories to look in, like the lists in<br/>
`exec-path' or `load-path'.<br/>
If SUFFIXES is non-nil, it should be a list of suffixes to append to<br/>
file name when searching.  If SUFFIXES is nil, it is equivalent to '("").<br/>
Use '("/") to disable PATH search, but still try the suffixes in SUFFIXES.<br/>
If non-nil, PREDICATE is used instead of `file-readable-p'.<br/>
<br/>
This function will normally skip directories, so if you want it to find<br/>
directories, make sure the PREDICATE function returns `dir-ok' for them.<br/>
<br/>
PREDICATE can also be an integer to pass to the `access' system call,<br/>
in which case file-name handlers are ignored.  This usage is deprecated.<br/>
For compatibility, PREDICATE can also be one of the symbols<br/>
`executable', `readable', `writable', or `exists', or a list of<br/>
one or more of those symbols.
