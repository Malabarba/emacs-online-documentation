<strong>locate-with-filter</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>locate.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(locate-with-filter <u>SEARCH-STRING</u> <u>FILTER</u> &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Run the executable program `locate' with a filter.</br>
This function is similar to the function `locate', which see.</br>
The difference is that, when invoked interactively, the present function</br>
prompts for both <u>SEARCH-STRING</u> and <u>FILTER</u>.  It passes <u>SEARCH-STRING</u></br>
to the locate executable program.  It produces a `*Locate*' buffer</br>
that lists only those lines in the output of the locate program that</br>
contain a match for the regular expression <u>FILTER</u>; this is often useful</br>
to constrain a big search.</br>
</br>
<u>ARG</u> is the interactive prefix arg, which has the same effect as in `locate'.</br>
</br>
When called from Lisp, this function is identical with `locate',</br>
except that <u>FILTER</u> is not optional.
