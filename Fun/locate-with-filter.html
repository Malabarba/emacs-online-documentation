locate-with-filter is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `locate.el'.<br/><br/>(locate-with-filter SEARCH-STRING FILTER &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Run the executable program `locate' with a filter.<br/>This function is similar to the function `locate', which see.<br/>The difference is that, when invoked interactively, the present function<br/>prompts for both SEARCH-STRING and FILTER.  It passes SEARCH-STRING<br/>to the locate executable program.  It produces a `*Locate*' buffer<br/>that lists only those lines in the output of the locate program that<br/>contain a match for the regular expression FILTER; this is often useful<br/>to constrain a big search.<br/><br/>ARG is the interactive prefix arg, which has the same effect as in `locate'.<br/><br/>When called from Lisp, this function is identical with `locate',<br/>except that FILTER is not optional.
