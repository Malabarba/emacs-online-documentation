<strong>locate</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>locate.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(locate <u>SEARCH-STRING</u> &optional <u>FILTER</u> <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Run the program `locate', putting results in `*Locate*' buffer.</br>
Pass it <u>SEARCH-STRING</u> as argument.  Interactively, prompt for <u>SEARCH-STRING</u>.</br>
With prefix arg <u>ARG</u>, prompt for the exact shell command to run instead.</br>
</br>
This program searches for those file names in a database that match</br>
<u>SEARCH-STRING</u> and normally outputs all matching absolute file names,</br>
one per line.  The database normally consists of all files on your</br>
system, or of all files that you have access to.  Consult the</br>
documentation of the program for the details about how it determines</br>
which file names match <u>SEARCH-STRING</u>.  (Those details vary highly with</br>
the version.)</br>
</br>
You can specify another program for this command to run by customizing</br>
the variables `locate-command' or `locate-make-command-line'.</br>
</br>
The main use of <u>FILTER</u> is to implement `locate-with-filter'.  See</br>
the docstring of that function for its meaning.</br>
</br>
After preparing the results buffer, this runs `dired-mode-hook' and</br>
then `locate-post-command-hook'.
