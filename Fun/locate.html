locate is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `locate.el'.<br/><br/>(locate SEARCH-STRING &optional FILTER ARG)<br/><br/>Run the program `locate', putting results in `*Locate*' buffer.<br/>Pass it SEARCH-STRING as argument.  Interactively, prompt for SEARCH-STRING.<br/>With prefix arg ARG, prompt for the exact shell command to run instead.<br/><br/>This program searches for those file names in a database that match<br/>SEARCH-STRING and normally outputs all matching absolute file names,<br/>one per line.  The database normally consists of all files on your<br/>system, or of all files that you have access to.  Consult the<br/>documentation of the program for the details about how it determines<br/>which file names match SEARCH-STRING.  (Those details vary highly with<br/>the version.)<br/><br/>You can specify another program for this command to run by customizing<br/>the variables `locate-command' or `locate-make-command-line'.<br/><br/>The main use of FILTER is to implement `locate-with-filter'.  See<br/>the docstring of that function for its meaning.<br/><br/>After preparing the results buffer, this runs `dired-mode-hook' and<br/>then `locate-post-command-hook'.
