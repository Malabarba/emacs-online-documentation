<strong>looking-back</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(looking-back REGEXP &optional LIMIT GREEDY)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if text before point matches regular expression REGEXP.<br/>
Like `looking-at' except matches before point, and is slower.<br/>
LIMIT if non-nil speeds up the search by specifying a minimum<br/>
starting position, to avoid checking matches that would start<br/>
before LIMIT.<br/>
<br/>
If GREEDY is non-nil, extend the match backwards as far as<br/>
possible, stopping when a single additional previous character<br/>
cannot be part of a match for REGEXP.  When the match is<br/>
extended, its starting position is allowed to occur before<br/>
LIMIT.
