looking-back is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(looking-back REGEXP &optional LIMIT GREEDY)<br/><br/>Return non-nil if text before point matches regular expression REGEXP.<br/>Like `looking-at' except matches before point, and is slower.<br/>LIMIT if non-nil speeds up the search by specifying a minimum<br/>starting position, to avoid checking matches that would start<br/>before LIMIT.<br/><br/>If GREEDY is non-nil, extend the match backwards as far as<br/>possible, stopping when a single additional previous character<br/>cannot be part of a match for REGEXP.  When the match is<br/>extended, its starting position is allowed to occur before<br/>LIMIT.
