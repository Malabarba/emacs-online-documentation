lookup-key is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(lookup-key KEYMAP KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)<br/><br/>In keymap KEYMAP, look up key sequence KEY.  Return the definition.<br/>A value of nil means undefined.  See doc of `define-key'<br/>for kinds of definitions.<br/><br/>A number as value means KEY is "too long";<br/>that is, characters or symbols in it except for the last one<br/>fail to be a valid sequence of prefix characters in KEYMAP.<br/>The number is how many characters at the front of KEY<br/>it takes to reach a non-prefix key.<br/><br/>Normally, `lookup-key' ignores bindings for t, which act as default<br/>bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it<br/>usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the<br/>third optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, `lookup-key' will<br/>recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.
