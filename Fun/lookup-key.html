<strong>lookup-key</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(lookup-key <u>KEYMAP</u> <u>KEY</u> &optional <u>ACCEPT-DEFAULT</u>)</br>
</br>
In keymap <u>KEYMAP</u>, look up key sequence <u>KEY</u>.  Return the definition.</br>
A value of nil means undefined.  See doc of `define-key'</br>
for kinds of definitions.</br>
</br>
A number as value means <u>KEY</u> is "too long";</br>
that is, characters or symbols in it except for the last one</br>
fail to be a valid sequence of prefix characters in <u>KEYMAP</u>.</br>
The number is how many characters at the front of <u>KEY</u></br>
it takes to reach a non-prefix key.</br>
</br>
Normally, `lookup-key' ignores bindings for t, which act as default</br>
bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it</br>
usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the</br>
third optional argument <u>ACCEPT-DEFAULT</u> is non-nil, `lookup-key' will</br>
recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.
