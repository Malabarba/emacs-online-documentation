<br/>
(lookup-nested-alist KEYSEQ ALIST &optional LEN START NIL-FOR-TOO-LONG)<br/>
<br/>
Look up key sequence KEYSEQ in nested alist ALIST.  Return the definition.<br/>
Optional 3rd argument LEN specifies the length of KEYSEQ.<br/>
Optional 4th argument START specifies index of the starting key.<br/>
The returned value is normally a nested alist of which<br/>
car part is the entry for KEYSEQ.<br/>
If ALIST is not deep enough for KEYSEQ, return number which is<br/>
 how many key elements at the front of KEYSEQ it takes<br/>
 to reach a leaf in ALIST.<br/>
Optional 5th argument NIL-FOR-TOO-LONG non-nil means return nil<br/>
