<strong>lower-frame</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(lower-frame &optional <u>FRAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Send <u>FRAME</u> to the back, so it is occluded by any frames that overlap it.</br>
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.</br>
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which</br>
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function does nothing.
