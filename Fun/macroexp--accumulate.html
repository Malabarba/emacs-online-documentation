<strong>macroexp--accumulate</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>macroexp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(macroexp--accumulate (VAR LIST) BODY...)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of the results of evaluating BODY for each element of LIST.<br/>
Evaluate BODY with VAR bound to each `car' from LIST, in turn.<br/>
Return a list of the values of the final form in BODY.<br/>
The list structure of the result will share as much with LIST as<br/>
possible (for instance, when BODY just returns VAR unchanged, the<br/>
result will be eq to LIST).
