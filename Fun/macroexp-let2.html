<strong>macroexp-let2</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>macroexp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(macroexp-let2 TEST VAR EXP &rest EXPS)<br/>
<br/>
Bind VAR to a copyable expression that returns the value of EXP.<br/>
This is like `(let ((v ,EXP)) ,EXPS) except that `v' is a new generated<br/>
symbol which EXPS can find in VAR.<br/>
TEST should be the name of a predicate on EXP checking whether the `let' can<br/>
be skipped; if nil, as is usual, `macroexp-const-p' is used.
