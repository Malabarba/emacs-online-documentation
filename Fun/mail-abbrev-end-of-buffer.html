<strong>mail-abbrev-end-of-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mailabbrev.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mail-abbrev-end-of-buffer &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Expand a mail abbrev before point, then move to the end of the buffer.</br>
This only expands an abbrev (if one is present) if called with</br>
point at the end of a line, or on whitespace before the end of a line.</br>
</br>
In other respects, this behaves like `end-of-buffer', which see.
