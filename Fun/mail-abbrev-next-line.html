<strong>mail-abbrev-next-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mailabbrev.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mail-abbrev-next-line &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Expand a mail abbrev before point, then move vertically down <u>ARG</u> lines.</br>
This only expands an abbrev (if one is present) if called with</br>
point at the end of a line, or on whitespace before the end of a line.</br>
</br>
In terms of line motion, this behaves like `next-line', which see.
