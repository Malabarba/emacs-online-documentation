<strong>mail-extract-address-components</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>mail-extr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mail-extract-address-components ADDRESS &optional ALL)<br/>
<br/>
Given an RFC-822 address ADDRESS, extract full name and canonical address.<br/>
Returns a list of the form (FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS).  If no<br/>
name can be extracted, FULL-NAME will be nil.  Also see<br/>
`mail-extr-ignore-single-names' and<br/>
`mail-extr-ignore-realname-equals-mailbox-name'.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional argument ALL is non-nil, then ADDRESS can contain zero<br/>
or more recipients, separated by commas, and we return a list of<br/>
the form ((FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS) ...) with one element for<br/>
each recipient.  If ALL is nil, then if ADDRESS contains more than<br/>
one recipients, all but the first is ignored.<br/>
<br/>
ADDRESS may be a string or a buffer.  If it is a buffer, the visible<br/>
(narrowed) portion of the buffer will be interpreted as the address.<br/>
(This feature exists so that the clever caller might be able to avoid<br/>
consing a string.)
