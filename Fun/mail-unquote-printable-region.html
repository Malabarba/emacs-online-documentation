<strong>mail-unquote-printable-region</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mail-utils.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mail-unquote-printable-region BEG END &optional WRAPPER NOERROR UNIBYTE)<br/>
<br/>
Undo the "quoted printable" encoding in buffer from BEG to END.<br/>
If the optional argument WRAPPER is non-nil,<br/>
we expect to find and remove the wrapper characters =?ISO-8859-1?Q?....?=.<br/>
On encountering malformed quoted-printable text, exits with an error,<br/>
unless NOERROR is non-nil, in which case it continues, and returns nil<br/>
when finished.  Returns non-nil on successful completion.<br/>
If UNIBYTE is non-nil, insert converted characters as unibyte.<br/>
That is useful if you are going to character code decoding afterward,<br/>
as Rmail does.
