<strong>make-backup-file-name</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(make-backup-file-name <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Create the non-numeric backup file name for <u>FILE</u>.</br>
Normally this will just be the file's name with `~' appended.</br>
Customization hooks are provided as follows.</br>
</br>
The value of `make-backup-file-name-function' should be a function which</br>
will be called with <u>FILE</u> as its argument; the resulting name is used.</br>
</br>
By default, a match for <u>FILE</u> is sought in `backup-directory-alist'; see</br>
the documentation of that variable.  If the directory for the backup</br>
doesn't exist, it is created.
