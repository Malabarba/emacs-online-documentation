<strong>make-comint-in-buffer</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>comint.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(make-comint-in-buffer NAME BUFFER PROGRAM &optional STARTFILE &rest SWITCHES)<br/>
<br/>
Make a Comint process NAME in BUFFER, running PROGRAM.<br/>
If BUFFER is nil, it defaults to NAME surrounded by `*'s.<br/>
If there is a running process in BUFFER, it is not restarted.<br/>
<br/>
PROGRAM should be one of the following:<br/>
- a string, denoting an executable program to create via<br/>
  `start-file-process'<br/>
- a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE), denoting a TCP<br/>
  connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'<br/>
- nil, denoting a newly-allocated pty.<br/>
<br/>
Optional fourth arg STARTFILE is the name of a file, whose<br/>
contents are sent to the process as its initial input.<br/>
<br/>
If PROGRAM is a string, any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.<br/>
<br/>
Return the (possibly newly created) process buffer.
