make-composed-keymap is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(make-composed-keymap MAPS &optional PARENT)<br/><br/>Construct a new keymap composed of MAPS and inheriting from PARENT.<br/>When looking up a key in the returned map, the key is looked in each<br/>keymap of MAPS in turn until a binding is found.<br/>If no binding is found in MAPS, the lookup continues in PARENT, if non-nil.<br/>As always with keymap inheritance, a nil binding in MAPS overrides<br/>any corresponding binding in PARENT, but it does not override corresponding<br/>bindings in other keymaps of MAPS.<br/>MAPS can be a list of keymaps or a single keymap.<br/>PARENT if non-nil should be a keymap.
