<strong>make-face</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>faces.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(make-face FACE &optional NO-INIT-FROM-RESOURCES)<br/>
<br/>
Define a new face with name FACE, a symbol.<br/>
Do not call this directly from Lisp code; use `defface' instead.<br/>
<br/>
If NO-INIT-FROM-RESOURCES is non-nil, don't initialize face<br/>
attributes from X resources.  If FACE is already known as a face,<br/>
leave it unmodified.  Return FACE.
