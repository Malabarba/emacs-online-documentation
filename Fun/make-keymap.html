<strong>make-keymap</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(make-keymap &optional <u>STRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Construct and return a new keymap, of the form (keymap CHARTABLE . ALIST).</br>
CHARTABLE is a char-table that holds the bindings for all characters</br>
without modifiers.  All entries in it are initially nil, meaning</br>
"command undefined".  ALIST is an assoc-list which holds bindings for</br>
function keys, mouse events, and any other things that appear in the</br>
input stream.  Initially, ALIST is nil.</br>
</br>
The optional arg <u>STRING</u> supplies a menu name for the keymap</br>
in case you use it as a menu with `x-popup-menu'.
