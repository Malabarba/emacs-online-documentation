<strong>make-local-variable</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(make-local-variable VARIABLE)<br/>
<br/>
Make VARIABLE have a separate value in the current buffer.<br/>
Other buffers will continue to share a common default value.<br/>
(The buffer-local value of VARIABLE starts out as the same value<br/>
VARIABLE previously had.  If VARIABLE was void, it remains void.)<br/>
Return VARIABLE.<br/>
<br/>
If the variable is already arranged to become local when set,<br/>
this function causes a local value to exist for this buffer,<br/>
just as setting the variable would do.<br/>
<br/>
This function returns VARIABLE, and therefore<br/>
  (set (make-local-variable 'VARIABLE) VALUE-EXP)<br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
See also `make-variable-buffer-local'.<br/>
<br/>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.<br/>
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.
