make-network-process is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(make-network-process &rest ARGS)<br/><br/>Create and return a network server or client process.<br/><br/>In Emacs, network connections are represented by process objects, so<br/>input and output work as for subprocesses and `delete-process' closes<br/>a network connection.  However, a network process has no process id,<br/>it cannot be signaled, and the status codes are different from normal<br/>processes.<br/><br/>Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following<br/>arguments are defined:<br/><br/>:name NAME -- NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary<br/>to make it unique.<br/><br/>:buffer BUFFER -- BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate<br/>with the process.  Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless<br/>you specify an output stream or filter function to handle the output.<br/>BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated<br/>with any buffer.<br/><br/>:host HOST -- HOST is name of the host to connect to, or its IP<br/>address.  The symbol `local' specifies the local host.  If specified<br/>for a server process, it must be a valid name or address for the local<br/>host, and only clients connecting to that address will be accepted.<br/><br/>:service SERVICE -- SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an<br/>integer specifying a port number to connect to.  If SERVICE is t,<br/>a random port number is selected for the server.  (If Emacs was<br/>compiled with getaddrinfo, a port number can also be specified as a<br/>string, e.g. "80", as well as an integer.  This is not portable.)<br/><br/>:type TYPE -- TYPE is the type of connection.  The default (nil) is a<br/>stream type connection, `datagram' creates a datagram type connection,<br/>`seqpacket' creates a reliable datagram connection.<br/><br/>:family FAMILY -- FAMILY is the address (and protocol) family for the<br/>service specified by HOST and SERVICE.  The default (nil) is to use<br/>whatever address family (IPv4 or IPv6) that is defined for the host<br/>and port number specified by HOST and SERVICE.  Other address families<br/>supported are:<br/>  local -- for a local (i.e. UNIX) address specified by SERVICE.<br/>  ipv4  -- use IPv4 address family only.<br/>  ipv6  -- use IPv6 address family only.<br/><br/>:local ADDRESS -- ADDRESS is the local address used for the connection.<br/>This parameter is ignored when opening a client process. When specified<br/>for a server process, the FAMILY, HOST and SERVICE args are ignored.<br/><br/>:remote ADDRESS -- ADDRESS is the remote partner's address for the<br/>connection.  This parameter is ignored when opening a stream server<br/>process.  For a datagram server process, it specifies the initial<br/>setting of the remote datagram address.  When specified for a client<br/>process, the FAMILY, HOST, and SERVICE args are ignored.<br/><br/>The format of ADDRESS depends on the address family:<br/>- An IPv4 address is represented as an vector of integers [A B C D P]<br/>corresponding to numeric IP address A.B.C.D and port number P.<br/>- A local address is represented as a string with the address in the<br/>local address space.<br/>- An "unsupported family" address is represented by a cons (F . AV)<br/>where F is the family number and AV is a vector containing the socket<br/>address data with one element per address data byte.  Do not rely on<br/>this format in portable code, as it may depend on implementation<br/>defined constants, data sizes, and data structure alignment.<br/><br/>:coding CODING -- If CODING is a symbol, it specifies the coding<br/>system used for both reading and writing for this process.  If CODING<br/>is a cons (DECODING . ENCODING), DECODING is used for reading, and<br/>ENCODING is used for writing.<br/><br/>:nowait BOOL -- If BOOL is non-nil for a stream type client process,<br/>return without waiting for the connection to complete; instead, the<br/>sentinel function will be called with second arg matching "open" (if<br/>successful) or "failed" when the connect completes.  Default is to use<br/>a blocking connect (i.e. wait) for stream type connections.<br/><br/>:noquery BOOL -- Query the user unless BOOL is non-nil, and process is<br/>running when Emacs is exited.<br/><br/>:stop BOOL -- Start process in the `stopped' state if BOOL non-nil.<br/>In the stopped state, a server process does not accept new<br/>connections, and a client process does not handle incoming traffic.<br/>The stopped state is cleared by `continue-process' and set by<br/>`stop-process'.<br/><br/>:filter FILTER -- Install FILTER as the process filter.<br/><br/>:filter-multibyte BOOL -- If BOOL is non-nil, strings given to the<br/>process filter are multibyte, otherwise they are unibyte.<br/>If this keyword is not specified, the strings are multibyte if<br/>the default value of `enable-multibyte-characters' is non-nil.<br/><br/>:sentinel SENTINEL -- Install SENTINEL as the process sentinel.<br/><br/>:log LOG -- Install LOG as the server process log function.  This<br/>function is called when the server accepts a network connection from a<br/>client.  The arguments are SERVER, CLIENT, and MESSAGE, where SERVER<br/>is the server process, CLIENT is the new process for the connection,<br/>and MESSAGE is a string.<br/><br/>:plist PLIST -- Install PLIST as the new process' initial plist.<br/><br/>:server QLEN -- if QLEN is non-nil, create a server process for the<br/>specified FAMILY, SERVICE, and connection type (stream or datagram).<br/>If QLEN is an integer, it is used as the max. length of the server's<br/>pending connection queue (also known as the backlog); the default<br/>queue length is 5.  Default is to create a client process.<br/><br/>The following network options can be specified for this connection:<br/><br/>:broadcast BOOL    -- Allow send and receive of datagram broadcasts.<br/>:dontroute BOOL    -- Only send to directly connected hosts.<br/>:keepalive BOOL    -- Send keep-alive messages on network stream.<br/>:linger BOOL or TIMEOUT -- Send queued messages before closing.<br/>:oobinline BOOL    -- Place out-of-band data in receive data stream.<br/>:priority INT      -- Set protocol defined priority for sent packets.<br/>:reuseaddr BOOL    -- Allow reusing a recently used local address<br/>                      (this is allowed by default for a server process).<br/>:bindtodevice NAME -- bind to interface NAME.  Using this may require<br/>                      special privileges on some systems.<br/><br/>Consult the relevant system programmer's manual pages for more<br/>information on using these options.<br/><br/><br/>A server process will listen for and accept connections from clients.<br/>When a client connection is accepted, a new network process is created<br/>for the connection with the following parameters:<br/><br/>- The client's process name is constructed by concatenating the server<br/>process' NAME and a client identification string.<br/>- If the FILTER argument is non-nil, the client process will not get a<br/>separate process buffer; otherwise, the client's process buffer is a newly<br/>created buffer named after the server process' BUFFER name or process<br/>NAME concatenated with the client identification string.<br/>- The connection type and the process filter and sentinel parameters are<br/>inherited from the server process' TYPE, FILTER and SENTINEL.<br/>- The client process' contact info is set according to the client's<br/>addressing information (typically an IP address and a port number).<br/>- The client process' plist is initialized from the server's plist.<br/><br/>Notice that the FILTER and SENTINEL args are never used directly by<br/>the server process.  Also, the BUFFER argument is not used directly by<br/>the server process, but via the optional :log function, accepted (and<br/>failed) connections may be logged in the server process' buffer.<br/><br/>The original argument list, modified with the actual connection<br/>information, is available via the `process-contact' function.
