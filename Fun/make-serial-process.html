<strong>make-serial-process</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(make-serial-process &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Create and return a serial port process.<br/>
<br/>
In Emacs, serial port connections are represented by process objects,<br/>
so input and output work as for subprocesses, and `delete-process'<br/>
closes a serial port connection.  However, a serial process has no<br/>
process id, it cannot be signaled, and the status codes are different<br/>
from normal processes.<br/>
<br/>
`make-serial-process' creates a process and a buffer, on which you<br/>
probably want to use `process-send-string'.  Try M-x serial-term for<br/>
an interactive terminal.  See below for examples.<br/>
<br/>
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following<br/>
arguments are defined:<br/>
<br/>
:port PORT -- (mandatory) PORT is the path or name of the serial port.<br/>
For example, this could be "/dev/ttyS0" on Unix.  On Windows, this<br/>
could be "COM1", or "\\.\COM10" for ports higher than COM9 (double<br/>
the backslashes in strings).<br/>
<br/>
:speed SPEED -- (mandatory) is handled by `serial-process-configure',<br/>
which this function calls.<br/>
<br/>
:name NAME -- NAME is the name of the process.  If NAME is not given,<br/>
the value of PORT is used.<br/>
<br/>
:buffer BUFFER -- BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate<br/>
with the process.  Process output goes at the end of that buffer,<br/>
unless you specify an output stream or filter function to handle the<br/>
output.  If BUFFER is not given, the value of NAME is used.<br/>
<br/>
:coding CODING -- If CODING is a symbol, it specifies the coding<br/>
system used for both reading and writing for this process.  If CODING<br/>
is a cons (DECODING . ENCODING), DECODING is used for reading, and<br/>
ENCODING is used for writing.<br/>
<br/>
:noquery BOOL -- When exiting Emacs, query the user if BOOL is nil and<br/>
the process is running.  If BOOL is not given, query before exiting.<br/>
<br/>
:stop BOOL -- Start process in the `stopped' state if BOOL is non-nil.<br/>
In the stopped state, a serial process does not accept incoming data,<br/>
but you can send outgoing data.  The stopped state is cleared by<br/>
`continue-process' and set by `stop-process'.<br/>
<br/>
:filter FILTER -- Install FILTER as the process filter.<br/>
<br/>
:sentinel SENTINEL -- Install SENTINEL as the process sentinel.<br/>
<br/>
:plist PLIST -- Install PLIST as the initial plist of the process.<br/>
<br/>
:bytesize<br/>
:parity<br/>
:stopbits<br/>
:flowcontrol<br/>
-- This function calls `serial-process-configure' to handle these<br/>
arguments.<br/>
<br/>
The original argument list, possibly modified by later configuration,<br/>
is available via the function `process-contact'.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
(make-serial-process :port "/dev/ttyS0" :speed 9600)<br/>
<br/>
(make-serial-process :port "COM1" :speed 115200 :stopbits 2)<br/>
<br/>
(make-serial-process :port "\\.\COM13" :speed 1200 :bytesize 7 :parity 'odd)<br/>
<br/>
(make-serial-process :port "/dev/tty.BlueConsole-SPP-1" :speed nil)
