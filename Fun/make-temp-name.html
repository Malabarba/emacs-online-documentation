make-temp-name is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(make-temp-name PREFIX)<br/><br/>Generate temporary file name (string) starting with PREFIX (a string).<br/>The Emacs process number forms part of the result,<br/>so there is no danger of generating a name being used by another process.<br/><br/>In addition, this function makes an attempt to choose a name<br/>which has no existing file.  To make this work,<br/>PREFIX should be an absolute file name.<br/><br/>There is a race condition between calling `make-temp-name' and creating the<br/>file which opens all kinds of security holes.  For that reason, you should<br/>probably use `make-temp-file' instead, except in three circumstances:<br/><br/>* If you are creating the file in the user's home directory.<br/>* If you are creating a directory rather than an ordinary file.<br/>* If you are taking special precautions as `make-temp-file' does.
