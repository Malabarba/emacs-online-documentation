<strong>make-temp-name</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(make-temp-name <u>PREFIX</u>)</br>
</br>
Generate temporary file name (string) starting with <u>PREFIX</u> (a string).</br>
The Emacs process number forms part of the result,</br>
so there is no danger of generating a name being used by another process.</br>
</br>
In addition, this function makes an attempt to choose a name</br>
which has no existing file.  To make this work,</br>
<u>PREFIX</u> should be an absolute file name.</br>
</br>
There is a race condition between calling `make-temp-name' and creating the</br>
file which opens all kinds of security holes.  For that reason, you should</br>
probably use `make-temp-file' instead, except in three circumstances:</br>
</br>
* If you are creating the file in the user's home directory.</br>
* If you are creating a directory rather than an ordinary file.</br>
* If you are taking special precautions as `make-temp-file' does.
