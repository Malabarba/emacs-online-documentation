make-text-button is a compiled Lisp function in `button.el'.<br/><br/>(make-text-button BEG END &rest PROPERTIES)<br/><br/>Make a button from BEG to END in the current buffer.<br/>The remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs,<br/>specifying properties to add to the button.<br/>In addition, the keyword argument :type may be used to specify a<br/>button-type from which to inherit other properties; see<br/>`define-button-type'.<br/><br/>This function is like `make-button', except that the button is actually<br/>part of the text instead of being a property of the buffer.  That is,<br/>this function uses text properties, the other uses overlays.<br/>Creating large numbers of buttons can also be somewhat faster<br/>using `make-text-button'.  Note, however, that if there is an existing<br/>face property at the site of the button, the button face may not be visible.<br/>You may want to use `make-button' in that case.<br/><br/>BEG can also be a string, in which case it is made into a button.<br/><br/>Also see `insert-text-button'.
