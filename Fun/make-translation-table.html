<br/>
Make a translation table from arguments.<br/>
A translation table is a char table intended for character<br/>
translation in CCL programs.<br/>
<br/>
Each argument is a list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), where FROM<br/>
is a character to be translated to TO.<br/>
<br/>
The arguments and forms in each argument are processed in the given<br/>
order, and if a previous form already translates TO to some other<br/>
character, say TO-ALT, FROM is also translated to TO-ALT.
