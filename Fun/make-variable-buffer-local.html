</br>
</br>
(make-variable-buffer-local <u>VARIABLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Make <u>VARIABLE</u> become buffer-local whenever it is set.</br>
At any time, the value for the current buffer is in effect,</br>
unless the variable has never been set in this buffer,</br>
in which case the default value is in effect.</br>
Note that binding the variable with `let', or setting it while</br>
a `let'-style binding made in this buffer is in effect,</br>
does not make the variable buffer-local.  Return <u>VARIABLE</u>.</br>
</br>
This globally affects all uses of this variable, so it belongs together with</br>
the variable declaration, rather than with its uses (if you just want to make</br>
a variable local to the current buffer for one particular use, use</br>
`make-local-variable').  Buffer-local bindings are normally cleared</br>
while setting up a new major mode, unless they have a `permanent-local'</br>
property.</br>
</br>
The function `default-value' gets the default value and `set-default' sets it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
