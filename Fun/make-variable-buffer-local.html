<strong>make-variable-buffer-local</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(make-variable-buffer-local VARIABLE)<br/>
<br/>
Make VARIABLE become buffer-local whenever it is set.<br/>
At any time, the value for the current buffer is in effect,<br/>
unless the variable has never been set in this buffer,<br/>
in which case the default value is in effect.<br/>
Note that binding the variable with `let', or setting it while<br/>
a `let'-style binding made in this buffer is in effect,<br/>
does not make the variable buffer-local.  Return VARIABLE.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases it is better to use `make-local-variable',<br/>
which makes a variable local in just one buffer.<br/>
<br/>
The function `default-value' gets the default value and `set-default' sets it.
