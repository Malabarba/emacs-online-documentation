<strong>make-variable-frame-local</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(make-variable-frame-local VARIABLE)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 22.2;<br/>
explicitly check for a frame-parameter instead.<br/>
<br/>
Enable VARIABLE to have frame-local bindings.<br/>
This does not create any frame-local bindings for VARIABLE,<br/>
it just makes them possible.<br/>
<br/>
A frame-local binding is actually a frame parameter value.<br/>
If a frame F has a value for the frame parameter named VARIABLE,<br/>
that also acts as a frame-local binding for VARIABLE in F--<br/>
provided this function has been called to enable VARIABLE<br/>
to have frame-local bindings at all.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to create a frame-local binding for VARIABLE in a frame<br/>
is to set the VARIABLE frame parameter of that frame.  See<br/>
`modify-frame-parameters' for how to set frame parameters.<br/>
<br/>
Note that since Emacs 23.1, variables cannot be both buffer-local and<br/>
frame-local any more (buffer-local bindings used to take precedence over<br/>
frame-local bindings).
