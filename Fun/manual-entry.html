<strong>manual-entry</strong> is an alias for `man' in `<code>man.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>

(manual-entry MAN-ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Get a Un*x manual page and put it in a buffer.<br/>
This command is the top-level command in the man package.  It<br/>
runs a Un*x command to retrieve and clean a manpage in the<br/>
background and places the results in a `Man-mode' browsing<br/>
buffer.  See variable `Man-notify-method' for what happens when<br/>
the buffer is ready.  If a buffer already exists for this man<br/>
page, it will display immediately.<br/>
<br/>
For a manpage from a particular section, use either of the<br/>
following.  "cat(1)" is how cross-references appear and is<br/>
passed to man as "1 cat".<br/>
<br/>
    cat(1)<br/>
    1 cat<br/>
<br/>
To see manpages from all sections related to a subject, use an<br/>
"all pages" option (which might be "-a" if it's not the<br/>
default), then step through with `Man-next-manpage' (M-n) etc.<br/>
Add to `Man-switches' to make this option permanent.<br/>
<br/>
    -a chmod<br/>
<br/>
An explicit filename can be given too.  Use -l if it might<br/>
otherwise look like a page name.<br/>
<br/>
    /my/file/name.1.gz<br/>
    -l somefile.1<br/>
<br/>
An "apropos" query with -k gives a buffer of matching page<br/>
names or descriptions.  The pattern argument is usually an<br/>
"egrep" style regexp.<br/>
<br/>
    -k pattern
