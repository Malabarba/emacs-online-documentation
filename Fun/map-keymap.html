</br>
(map-keymap <u>FUNCTION</u> <u>KEYMAP</u>)</br>
</br>
Call <u>FUNCTION</u> once for each event binding in <u>KEYMAP</u>.</br>
<u>FUNCTION</u> is called with two arguments: the event that is bound, and</br>
the definition it is bound to.  The event may be a character range.</br>
</br>
If <u>KEYMAP</u> has a parent, the parent's bindings are included as well.</br>
This works recursively: if the parent has itself a parent, then the</br>
grandparent's bindings are also included and so on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
