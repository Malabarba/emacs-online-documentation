<strong>map-y-or-n-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>map-ynp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(map-y-or-n-p PROMPTER ACTOR LIST &optional HELP ACTION-ALIST NO-CURSOR-IN-ECHO-AREA)<br/>
<br/>
Ask a series of boolean questions.<br/>
Takes args PROMPTER ACTOR LIST, and optional args HELP and ACTION-ALIST.<br/>
<br/>
LIST is a list of objects, or a function of no arguments to return the next<br/>
object or nil.<br/>
<br/>
If PROMPTER is a string, the prompt is (format PROMPTER OBJECT).  If not<br/>
a string, PROMPTER is a function of one arg (an object from LIST), which<br/>
returns a string to be used as the prompt for that object.  If the return<br/>
value is not a string, it may be nil to ignore the object or non-nil to act<br/>
on the object without asking the user.<br/>
<br/>
ACTOR is a function of one arg (an object from LIST),<br/>
which gets called with each object that the user answers `yes' for.<br/>
<br/>
If HELP is given, it is a list (OBJECT OBJECTS ACTION),<br/>
where OBJECT is a string giving the singular noun for an elt of LIST;<br/>
OBJECTS is the plural noun for elts of LIST, and ACTION is a transitive<br/>
verb describing ACTOR.  The default is ("object" "objects" "act on").<br/>
<br/>
At the prompts, the user may enter y, Y, or SPC to act on that object;<br/>
n, N, or DEL to skip that object; ! to act on all following objects;<br/>
ESC or q to exit (skip all following objects); . (period) to act on the<br/>
current object and then exit; or C-h to get help.<br/>
<br/>
If ACTION-ALIST is given, it is an alist (KEY FUNCTION HELP) of extra keys<br/>
that will be accepted.  KEY is a character; FUNCTION is a function of one<br/>
arg (an object from LIST); HELP is a string.  When the user hits KEY,<br/>
FUNCTION is called.  If it returns non-nil, the object is considered<br/>
"acted upon", and the next object from LIST is processed.  If it returns<br/>
nil, the prompt is repeated for the same object.<br/>
<br/>
Final optional argument NO-CURSOR-IN-ECHO-AREA non-nil says not to set<br/>
`cursor-in-echo-area' while prompting.<br/>
<br/>
This function uses `query-replace-map' to define the standard responses,<br/>
but not all of the responses which `query-replace' understands<br/>
are meaningful here.<br/>
<br/>
Returns the number of actions taken.
