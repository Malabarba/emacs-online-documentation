mapcar* is an alias for `cl-mapcar' in `cl.el'.<br/><br/>(mapcar* FUNCTION SEQ...)<br/><br/>Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQ, and make a list of the results.<br/>If there are several SEQs, FUNCTION is called with that many arguments,<br/>and mapping stops as soon as the shortest list runs out.  With just one<br/>SEQ, this is like `mapcar'.  With several, it is like the Common Lisp<br/>`mapcar' function extended to arbitrary sequence types.
