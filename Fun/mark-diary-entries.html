mark-diary-entries is an alias for `diary-mark-entries' in `diary-lib.el'.<br/><br/>(mark-diary-entries &optional REDRAW)<br/><br/>This function is obsolete since 23.1;<br/>use `diary-mark-entries' instead.<br/><br/>Mark days in the calendar window that have diary entries.<br/>Marks each entry in the diary that is visible in the calendar window.<br/><br/>After marking the entries, runs `diary-nongregorian-marking-hook'<br/>for the main diary file, and each included file.  For example,<br/>this is the appropriate hook to process Islamic entries in all<br/>diary files.  Next `diary-mark-entries-hook' runs, for the main diary<br/>file only.  If not using include files, there is no difference between<br/>these two hooks.<br/><br/>If the optional argument REDRAW is non-nil (which is the case<br/>interactively, for example) then this first removes any existing diary<br/>marks.  This is intended to deal with deleted diary entries.
