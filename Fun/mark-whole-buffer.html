<strong>mark-whole-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x h, &lt;menu-bar> &lt;edit> &lt;mark-whole-buffer>.</br>
</br>
<code>(mark-whole-buffer</code>)</br>
</br>
Put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer.</br>
If narrowing is in effect, only uses the accessible part of the buffer.</br>
You probably should not use this function in Lisp programs;</br>
it is usually a mistake for a Lisp function to use any subroutine</br>
that uses or sets the mark.
