<strong>match-data</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(match-data &optional INTEGERS REUSE RESEAT)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list containing all info on what the last search matched.<br/>
Element 2N is `(match-beginning N)'; element 2N + 1 is `(match-end N)'.<br/>
All the elements are markers or nil (nil if the Nth pair didn't match)<br/>
if the last match was on a buffer; integers or nil if a string was matched.<br/>
Use `set-match-data' to reinstate the data in this list.<br/>
<br/>
If INTEGERS (the optional first argument) is non-nil, always use<br/>
integers (rather than markers) to represent buffer positions.  In<br/>
this case, and if the last match was in a buffer, the buffer will get<br/>
stored as one additional element at the end of the list.<br/>
<br/>
If REUSE is a list, reuse it as part of the value.  If REUSE is long<br/>
enough to hold all the values, and if INTEGERS is non-nil, no consing<br/>
is done.<br/>
<br/>
If optional third arg RESEAT is non-nil, any previous markers on the<br/>
REUSE list will be modified to point to nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
Return value is undefined if the last search failed.
