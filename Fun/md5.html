<strong>md5</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(md5 OBJECT &optional START END CODING-SYSTEM NOERROR)<br/>
<br/>
Return MD5 message digest of OBJECT, a buffer or string.<br/>
<br/>
A message digest is a cryptographic checksum of a document, and the<br/>
algorithm to calculate it is defined in RFC 1321.<br/>
<br/>
The two optional arguments START and END are character positions<br/>
specifying for which part of OBJECT the message digest should be<br/>
computed.  If nil or omitted, the digest is computed for the whole<br/>
OBJECT.<br/>
<br/>
The MD5 message digest is computed from the result of encoding the<br/>
text in a coding system, not directly from the internal Emacs form of<br/>
the text.  The optional fourth argument CODING-SYSTEM specifies which<br/>
coding system to encode the text with.  It should be the same coding<br/>
system that you used or will use when actually writing the text into a<br/>
file.<br/>
<br/>
If CODING-SYSTEM is nil or omitted, the default depends on OBJECT.  If<br/>
OBJECT is a buffer, the default for CODING-SYSTEM is whatever coding<br/>
system would be chosen by default for writing this text into a file.<br/>
<br/>
If OBJECT is a string, the most preferred coding system (see the<br/>
command `prefer-coding-system') is used.<br/>
<br/>
If NOERROR is non-nil, silently assume the `raw-text' coding if the<br/>
guesswork fails.  Normally, an error is signaled in such case.
