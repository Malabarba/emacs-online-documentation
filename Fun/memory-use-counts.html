</br>
(memory-use-counts)</br>
</br>
Return a list of counters that measure how much consing there has been.</br>
Each of these counters increments for a certain kind of object.</br>
The counters wrap around from the largest positive integer to zero.</br>
Garbage collection does not decrease them.</br>
The elements of the value are as follows:</br>
  (CONSES FLOATS VECTOR-CELLS SYMBOLS STRING-CHARS MISCS INTERVALS STRINGS)</br>
All are in units of 1 = one object consed</br>
except for VECTOR-CELLS and STRING-CHARS, which count the total length of</br>
objects consed.</br>
MISCS include overlays, markers, and some internal types.</br>
Frames, windows, buffers, and subprocesses count as vectors</br>
  (but the contents of a buffer's text do not count here).<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
