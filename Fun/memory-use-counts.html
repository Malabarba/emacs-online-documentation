<strong>memory-use-counts</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(memory-use-counts)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of counters that measure how much consing there has been.<br/>
Each of these counters increments for a certain kind of object.<br/>
The counters wrap around from the largest positive integer to zero.<br/>
Garbage collection does not decrease them.<br/>
The elements of the value are as follows:<br/>
  (CONSES FLOATS VECTOR-CELLS SYMBOLS STRING-CHARS MISCS INTERVALS STRINGS)<br/>
All are in units of 1 = one object consed<br/>
except for VECTOR-CELLS and STRING-CHARS, which count the total length of<br/>
objects consed.<br/>
MISCS include overlays, markers, and some internal types.<br/>
Frames, windows, buffers, and subprocesses count as vectors<br/>
  (but the contents of a buffer's text do not count here).
