<strong>message-generate-unsubscribed-mail-followup-to</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>message.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(message-generate-unsubscribed-mail-followup-to &optional <u>INCLUDE-CC</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert a reasonable MFT header in a post to an unsubscribed list.</br>
When making original posts to a mailing list you are not subscribed to,</br>
you have to type in a MFT header by hand.  The contents, usually, are</br>
the addresses of the list and your own address.  This function inserts</br>
such a header automatically.  It fetches the contents of the To: header</br>
in the current mail buffer, and appends the current `user-mail-address'.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>INCLUDE-CC</u> is non-nil, the addresses in the</br>
Cc: header are also put into the MFT.
