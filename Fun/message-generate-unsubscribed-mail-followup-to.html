The contents, usually, are<br/>the addresses of the list and your own address.  This function inserts<br/>such a header automatically.  It fetches the contents of the To: header<br/>in the current mail buffer, and appends the current `user-mail-address'.<br/><br/>If the optional argument INCLUDE-CC is non-nil, the addresses in the<br/>Cc: header are also put into the MFT.
