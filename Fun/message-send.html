<strong>message-send</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>message.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(message-send &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Send the message in the current buffer.</br>
If `message-interactive' is non-nil, wait for success indication or</br>
error messages, and inform user.</br>
Otherwise any failure is reported in a message back to the user from</br>
the mailer.</br>
The usage of <u>ARG</u> is defined by the instance that called Message.</br>
It should typically alter the sending method in some way or other.
