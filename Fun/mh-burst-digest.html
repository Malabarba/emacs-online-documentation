</br>
</br>
(mh-burst-digest)</br>
</br>
Break up digest into separate messages.</br>
</br>
This command uses the MH command "burst" to break out each</br>
message in the digest into its own message. Using this command,</br>
you can quickly delete unwanted messages, like this: Once the</br>
digest is split up, toggle out of MH-Folder Show mode with</br>
t so that the scan lines fill the screen and</br>
messages aren't displayed. Then use d to quickly</br>
delete messages that you don't want to read (based on the</br>
"Subject:" header field). You can also burst the digest to</br>
reply directly to the people who posted the messages in the</br>
digest. One problem you may encounter is that the "From:"</br>
header fields are preceded with a ">" so that your reply can't</br>
create the "To:" field correctly. In this case, you must</br>
correct the "To:" field yourself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
