<strong>mh-delete-msg</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.</br>
</br>

(mh-delete-msg <u>RANGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete <u>RANGE</u>.</br>
</br>
To mark a message for deletion, use this command. A "D" is</br>
placed by the message in the scan window, and the next undeleted</br>
message is displayed. If the previous command had been</br>
p, then the next message displayed is</br>
the first undeleted message previous to the message just deleted.</br>
Use n to force subsequent</br>
d commands to move forward to the next undeleted</br>
message after deleting the message under the cursor.</br>
</br>
The hook `mh-delete-msg-hook' is called after you mark a message</br>
for deletion. For example, a past maintainer of MH-E used this</br>
once when he kept statistics on his mail usage.</br>
