mh-delete-msg is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mh-folder.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-delete-msg RANGE)<br/><br/>Delete RANGE.<br/><br/>To mark a message for deletion, use this command. A "D" is<br/>placed by the message in the scan window, and the next undeleted<br/>message is displayed. If the previous command had been<br/>p, then the next message displayed is<br/>the first undeleted message previous to the message just deleted.<br/>Use n to force subsequent<br/>d commands to move forward to the next undeleted<br/>message after deleting the message under the cursor.<br/><br/>The hook `mh-delete-msg-hook' is called after you mark a message<br/>for deletion. For example, a past maintainer of MH-E used this<br/>once when he kept statistics on his mail usage.<br/><br/>Check the documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how<br/>RANGE is read in interactive use.
