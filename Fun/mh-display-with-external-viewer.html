</br>
</br>
(mh-display-with-external-viewer <u>PART-INDEX</u>)</br>
</br>
View attachment externally.</br>
</br>
If Emacs does not know how to view an attachment, you could save</br>
it into a file and then run some program to open it. It is</br>
easier, however, to launch the program directly from MH-E with</br>
this command. While you'll most likely use this to view</br>
spreadsheets and documents, it is also useful to use your browser</br>
to view HTML attachments with higher fidelity than what Emacs can</br>
provide.</br>
</br>
This command displays the attachment associated with the button</br>
under the cursor. If the cursor is not located over a button,</br>
then the cursor first moves to the next button, wrapping to the</br>
beginning of the message if necessary. You can provide a numeric</br>
prefix argument <u>PART-INDEX</u> to view the attachment labeled with</br>
that number.</br>
</br>
This command tries to provide a reasonable default for the viewer</br>
by calling the Emacs function `mailcap-mime-info'. This function</br>
usually reads the file "/etc/mailcap".<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
