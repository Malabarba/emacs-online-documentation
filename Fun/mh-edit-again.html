<strong>mh-edit-again</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-comp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-edit-again MESSAGE)<br/>
<br/>
Edit a MESSAGE to send it again.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't complete a draft for one reason or another, and if<br/>
the draft buffer is no longer available, you can pick your draft<br/>
up again with this command. If you don't use a draft folder, your<br/>
last "draft" file will be used. If you use draft folders,<br/>
you'll need to visit the draft folder with "M-x mh-visit-folder<br/>
drafts <RET>", use M-x mh-next-undeleted-msg to move to the<br/>
appropriate message, and then use M-x mh-edit-again to prepare<br/>
the message for editing.<br/>
<br/>
This command can also be used to take messages that were sent to<br/>
you and to send them to more people.<br/>
<br/>
Don't use this command to re-edit a message from a Mailer-Daemon<br/>
who complained that your mail wasn't posted for some reason or<br/>
another (see `mh-extract-rejected-mail').<br/>
<br/>
The default message is the current message.<br/>
<br/>
