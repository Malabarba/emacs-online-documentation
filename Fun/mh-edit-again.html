</br>
</br>
(mh-edit-again <u>MESSAGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Edit a <u>MESSAGE</u> to send it again.</br>
</br>
If you don't complete a draft for one reason or another, and if</br>
the draft buffer is no longer available, you can pick your draft</br>
up again with this command. If you don't use a draft folder, your</br>
last "draft" file will be used. If you use draft folders,</br>
you'll need to visit the draft folder with "M-x mh-visit-folder</br>
drafts &lt;RET>", use M-x mh-next-undeleted-msg to move to the</br>
appropriate message, and then use M-x mh-edit-again to prepare</br>
the message for editing.</br>
</br>
This command can also be used to take messages that were sent to</br>
you and to send them to more people.</br>
</br>
Don't use this command to re-edit a message from a Mailer-Daemon</br>
who complained that your mail wasn't posted for some reason or</br>
another (see `mh-extract-rejected-mail').</br>
</br>
The default message is the current message.</br>
