<strong>mh-execute-commands</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-execute-commands)<br/>
<br/>
Process outstanding delete and refile requests.<br/>
<br/>
If you've marked messages to be deleted or refiled and you want<br/>
to go ahead and delete or refile the messages, use this command.<br/>
Many MH-E commands that may affect the numbering of the<br/>
messages (such as F r or F p)<br/>
will ask if you want to process refiles or deletes first and then<br/>
either run this command for you or undo the pending refiles and<br/>
deletes.<br/>
<br/>
This function runs `mh-before-commands-processed-hook' before the<br/>
commands are processed and `mh-after-commands-processed-hook'<br/>
after the commands are processed.
