<strong>mh-execute-commands</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-execute-commands)</br>
</br>
Perform outstanding operations.</br>
</br>
If you've marked messages to be refiled, deleted, blacklisted, or</br>
whitelisted and you want to go ahead and perform these operations</br>
on these messages, use this command. Many MH-E commands that may</br>
affect the numbering of the messages (such as</br>
F r or F p) will ask if you want</br>
to perform these operations first and then either run this</br>
command for you or undo the pending operations.</br>
</br>
This function runs `mh-before-commands-processed-hook' before the</br>
commands are processed and `mh-after-commands-processed-hook'</br>
after the commands are processed.
