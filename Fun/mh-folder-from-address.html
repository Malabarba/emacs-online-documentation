<strong>mh-folder-from-address</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mh-folder-from-address)</br>
</br>
Derive folder name from sender.</br>
</br>
The name of the folder is derived as follows:</br>
</br>
  a) The folder name associated with the first address found in</br>
     the list `mh-default-folder-list' is used. Each element in</br>
     this list contains a "Check Recipient" item. If this item is</br>
     turned on, then the address is checked against the recipient</br>
     instead of the sender. This is useful for mailing lists.</br>
</br>
  b) An alias prefixed by `mh-default-folder-prefix'</br>
     corresponding to the address is used. The prefix is used to</br>
     prevent clutter in your mail directory.</br>
</br>
Return nil if a folder name was not derived, or if the variable</br>
`mh-default-folder-must-exist-flag' is t and the folder does not</br>
exist.
