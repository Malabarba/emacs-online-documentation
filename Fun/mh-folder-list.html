<strong>mh-folder-list</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>mh-utils.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-folder-list FOLDER)<br/>
<br/>
Return FOLDER and its descendants.<br/>
FOLDER may have a + prefix. Returns a list of strings without the<br/>
+ prefix. If FOLDER is nil, then all folders are considered. For<br/>
example, if your Mail directory only contains the folders +inbox,<br/>
+outbox, +lists, and +lists/mh-e, then<br/>
<br/>
  (mh-folder-list nil)<br/>
       => ("inbox" "lists" "lists/mh-e" "outbox")<br/>
  (mh-folder-list "+lists")<br/>
       => ("lists" "lists/mh-e")<br/>
<br/>
Respects the value of `mh-recursive-folders-flag'. If this flag<br/>
is nil, and the sub-folders have not been explicitly viewed, then<br/>
they will not be returned.
