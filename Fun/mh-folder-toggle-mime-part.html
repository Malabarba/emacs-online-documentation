<strong>mh-folder-toggle-mime-part</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-mime.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-folder-toggle-mime-part PART-INDEX)<br/>
<br/>
View attachment.<br/>
<br/>
This command displays (or hides) the attachment associated with<br/>
the button under the cursor. If the cursor is not located over a<br/>
button, then the cursor first moves to the next button, wrapping<br/>
to the beginning of the message if necessary. This command has<br/>
the advantage over related commands of working from the MH-Folder<br/>
buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can also provide a numeric prefix argument PART-INDEX to view<br/>
the attachment labeled with that number. If Emacs does not know<br/>
how to display the attachment, then Emacs offers to save the<br/>
attachment in a file.
