<strong>mh-forward</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-comp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-forward <u>TO</u> <u>CC</u> &optional <u>RANGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Forward message.</br>
</br>
You are prompted for the <u>TO</u> and <u>CC</u> recipients. You are given a</br>
draft to edit that looks like it would if you had run the MH</br>
command "forw". You can then add some text.</br>
</br>
You can forward several messages by using a <u>RANGE</u>. All of the</br>
messages in the range are inserted into your draft. Check the</br>
documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how <u>RANGE</u> is read</br>
in interactive use.</br>
</br>
The hook `mh-forward-hook' is called on the draft.</br>
