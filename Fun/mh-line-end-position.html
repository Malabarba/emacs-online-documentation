mh-line-end-position is an alias for `line-end-position' in `mh-compat.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-line-end-position &optional N)<br/><br/>Return the character position of the last character on the current line.<br/>With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.<br/>If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.<br/><br/>This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the<br/>position of the last character in logical order, i.e. the largest<br/>character position on the line.<br/><br/>This function constrains the returned position to the current field<br/>unless that would be on a different line than the original,<br/>unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends<br/>at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field<br/>boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.<br/><br/>This function does not move point.
