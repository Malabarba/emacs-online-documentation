<strong>mh-mime-save-parts</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-mime.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-mime-save-parts <u>PROMPT</u>)</br>
</br>
Save attachments.</br>
</br>
You can save all of the attachments at once with this command.</br>
The attachments are saved in the directory specified by the</br>
option `mh-mime-save-parts-default-directory' unless you use a</br>
prefix argument <u>PROMPT</u> in which case you are prompted for the</br>
directory. These directories may be superseded by MH profile</br>
components, since this function calls on "mhstore" ("mhn") to</br>
do the work.
