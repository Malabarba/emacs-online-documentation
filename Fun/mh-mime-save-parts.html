mh-mime-save-parts is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mh-mime.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-mime-save-parts PROMPT)<br/><br/>Save attachments.<br/><br/>You can save all of the attachments at once with this command.<br/>The attachments are saved in the directory specified by the<br/>option `mh-mime-save-parts-default-directory' unless you use a<br/>prefix argument PROMPT in which case you are prompted for the<br/>directory. These directories may be superseded by MH profile<br/>components, since this function calls on "mhstore" ("mhn") to<br/>do the work.
