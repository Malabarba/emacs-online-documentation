mh-narrow-to-tick is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mh-seq.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-narrow-to-tick)<br/><br/>Limit to ticked messages.<br/><br/>What this command does is show only those messages that are in<br/>the "tick" sequence (which you can customize via the<br/>`mh-tick-seq' option) in the MH-Folder buffer. In addition, it<br/>limits further MH-E searches to just those messages. When you<br/>want to widen the view to all your messages again, use<br/>M-x mh-widen.
