<strong>mh-pack-folder</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>mh-funcs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-pack-folder <u>RANGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Pack folder.</br>
</br>
This command packs the folder, removing gaps from the numbering</br>
sequence. If you don't want to rescan the entire folder</br>
afterward, this command will accept a <u>RANGE</u>. Check the</br>
documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how <u>RANGE</u> is read</br>
in interactive use.</br>
</br>
This command will ask if you want to process refiles or deletes</br>
first and then either run x for you or undo</br>
the pending refiles and deletes.</br>
</br>
The hook `mh-pack-folder-hook' is run after the folder is packed;</br>
see its documentation for variables it can use.
