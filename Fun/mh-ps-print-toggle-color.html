<strong>mh-ps-print-toggle-color</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>mh-print.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-ps-print-toggle-color)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle whether color is used in printing messages.<br/>
<br/>
Colors are emulated on black-and-white printers with shades of<br/>
gray. This might produce illegible output, even if your screen<br/>
colors only use shades of gray. If this is the case, try using<br/>
this command to toggle between color, no color, and a black and<br/>
white representation of the colors and see which works best. You<br/>
change this setting permanently by customizing the option<br/>
`ps-print-color-p'.
