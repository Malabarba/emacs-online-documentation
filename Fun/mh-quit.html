</br>
</br>
(mh-quit)</br>
</br>
Quit the current MH-E folder.</br>
</br>
When you want to quit using MH-E and go back to editing, you can use</br>
this command. This buries the buffers of the current MH-E folder and</br>
restores the buffers that were present when you first ran</br>
M-x mh-rmail. It also removes any MH-E working buffers whose name</br>
begins with " *mh-" or "*MH-E ". You can later restore your MH-E</br>
session by selecting the "+inbox" buffer or by running M-x mh-rmail</br>
again.</br>
</br>
The two hooks `mh-before-quit-hook' and `mh-quit-hook' are called by</br>
this function. The former one is called before the quit occurs, so you</br>
might use it to perform any MH-E operations; you could perform some</br>
query and abort the quit or call `mh-execute-commands', for example.</br>
The latter is not run in an MH-E context, so you might use it to</br>
modify the window setup.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
