mh-recenter is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mh-folder.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-recenter ARG)<br/><br/>Like recenter but with three improvements:<br/><br/>- At the end of the buffer it tries to show fewer empty lines.<br/><br/>- operates only if the current buffer is in the selected window.<br/>  (Commands like `save-some-buffers' can make this false.)<br/><br/>- nil ARG means recenter as if prefix argument had been given.
