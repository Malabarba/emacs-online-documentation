<strong>mh-recenter</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mh-recenter <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Like recenter but with three improvements:</br>
</br>
- At the end of the buffer it tries to show fewer empty lines.</br>
</br>
- operates only if the current buffer is in the selected window.</br>
  (Commands like `save-some-buffers' can make this false.)</br>
</br>
- nil <u>ARG</u> means recenter as if prefix argument had been given.
