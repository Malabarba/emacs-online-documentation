<strong>mh-redistribute</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-comp.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-redistribute <u>TO</u> <u>CC</u> &optional <u>MESSAGE</u>)</br>
</br>
Redistribute a message.</br>
</br>
This command is similar in function to forwarding mail, but it</br>
does not allow you to edit the message, nor does it add your name</br>
to the "From" header field. It appears to the recipient as if</br>
the message had come from the original sender. When you run this</br>
command, you are prompted for the <u>TO</u> and <u>CC</u> recipients. The</br>
default <u>MESSAGE</u> is the current message.</br>
</br>
Also investigate the command M-x mh-edit-again for another way to</br>
redistribute messages.</br>
</br>
See also `mh-redist-full-contents-flag'.</br>
</br>
The hook `mh-annotate-msg-hook' is run after annotating the</br>
message and scan line.
