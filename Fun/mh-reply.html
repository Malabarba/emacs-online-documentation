mh-reply is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mh-comp.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-reply MESSAGE &optional REPLY-TO INCLUDEP)<br/><br/>Reply to a MESSAGE.<br/><br/>When you reply to a message, you are first prompted with "Reply<br/>to whom?" (unless the optional argument REPLY-TO is provided).<br/>You have several choices here.<br/><br/>     Response     Reply Goes To<br/><br/>     from         The person who sent the message. This is the<br/>                  default, so <RET> is sufficient.<br/><br/>     to           Replies to the sender, plus all recipients in the<br/>                  "To:" header field.<br/><br/>     all cc       Forms a reply to the addresses in the<br/>                  "Mail-Followup-To:" header field if one<br/>                  exists; otherwise forms a reply to the sender,<br/>                  plus all recipients.<br/><br/>Depending on your answer, "repl" is given a different argument<br/>to form your reply. Specifically, a choice of "from" or none at<br/>all runs "repl -nocc all", and a choice of "to" runs "repl<br/>-cc to". Finally, either "cc" or "all" runs "repl -cc all<br/>-nocc me".<br/><br/>Two windows are then created. One window contains the message to<br/>which you are replying in an MH-Show buffer. Your draft, in<br/>MH-Letter mode (*note `mh-letter-mode'), is in the other window.<br/>If the reply draft was not one that you expected, check the<br/>things that affect the behavior of "repl" which include the<br/>"repl:" profile component and the "replcomps" and<br/>"replgroupcomps" files.<br/><br/>If you supply a prefix argument INCLUDEP, the message you are<br/>replying to is inserted in your reply after having first been run<br/>through "mhl" with the format file "mhl.reply".<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can customize the option `mh-yank-behavior'<br/>and choose one of its "Automatically" variants to do the same<br/>thing. If you do so, the prefix argument has no effect.<br/><br/>Another way to include the message automatically in your draft is<br/>to use "repl: -filter repl.filter" in your MH profile.<br/><br/>If you wish to customize the header or other parts of the reply<br/>draft, please see "repl" and "mh-format".<br/><br/>See also `mh-reply-show-message-flag',<br/>`mh-reply-default-reply-to', and `mh-send'.
