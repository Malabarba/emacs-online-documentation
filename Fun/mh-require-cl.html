<strong>mh-require-cl</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>mh-acros.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mh-require-cl)</br>
</br>
Macro to load "cl" if needed.</br>
</br>
Emacs coding conventions require that the "cl" package not be</br>
required at runtime. However, the "cl" package in Emacs 21.4</br>
and earlier left "cl" routines in their macro expansions. In</br>
particular, the expansion of (setf (gethash ...) ...) used</br>
functions in "cl" at run time. This macro recognizes that and</br>
loads "cl" appropriately.
