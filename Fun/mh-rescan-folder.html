<strong>mh-rescan-folder</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-rescan-folder &optional <u>RANGE</u> <u>DONT-EXEC-PENDING</u>)</br>
</br>
Rescan folder.</br>
</br>
This command is useful to grab all messages in your "+inbox" after</br>
processing your new mail for the first time. If you don't want to</br>
rescan the entire folder, this command will accept a <u>RANGE</u>. Check the</br>
documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how <u>RANGE</u> is read in</br>
interactive use.</br>
</br>
This command will ask if you want to process refiles or deletes first</br>
and then either run x for you or undo the</br>
pending refiles and deletes.</br>
</br>
In a program, the processing of outstanding commands is not performed</br>
if <u>DONT-EXEC-PENDING</u> is non-nil.
