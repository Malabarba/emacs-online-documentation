<strong>mh-rescan-folder</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-rescan-folder &optional RANGE DONT-EXEC-PENDING)<br/>
<br/>
Rescan folder.<br/>
<br/>
This command is useful to grab all messages in your "+inbox" after<br/>
processing your new mail for the first time. If you don't want to<br/>
rescan the entire folder, this command will accept a RANGE. Check the<br/>
documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how RANGE is read in<br/>
interactive use.<br/>
<br/>
This command will ask if you want to process refiles or deletes first<br/>
and then either run x for you or undo the<br/>
pending refiles and deletes.<br/>
<br/>
In a program, the processing of outstanding commands is not performed<br/>
if DONT-EXEC-PENDING is non-nil.
