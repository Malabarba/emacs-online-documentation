mh-send-letter is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mh-comp.el'.<br/><br/>(mh-send-letter &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Save draft and send message.<br/><br/>When you are all through editing a message, you send it with this<br/>command. You can give a prefix argument ARG to monitor the first stage<br/>of the delivery; this output can be found in a buffer called "*MH-E<br/>Mail Delivery*".<br/><br/>The hook `mh-before-send-letter-hook' is run at the beginning of<br/>this command. For example, if you want to check your spelling in<br/>your message before sending, add the function `ispell-message'.<br/><br/>Unless `mh-insert-auto-fields' had previously been called<br/>manually, the function `mh-insert-auto-fields' is called to<br/>insert fields based upon the recipients. If fields are added, you<br/>are given a chance to see and to confirm these fields before the<br/>message is actually sent. You can do away with this confirmation<br/>by turning off the option `mh-auto-fields-prompt-flag'.<br/><br/>In case the MH "send" program is installed under a different name,<br/>use `mh-send-prog' to tell MH-E the name.<br/><br/>The hook `mh-annotate-msg-hook' is run after annotating the<br/>message and scan line.
