<strong>mh-show</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-show.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-show &optional MESSAGE REDISPLAY-FLAG)<br/>
<br/>
Display message.<br/>
<br/>
If the message under the cursor is already displayed, this command<br/>
scrolls to the beginning of the message. MH-E normally hides a lot of<br/>
the superfluous header fields that mailers add to a message, but if<br/>
you wish to see all of them, use the command ,.<br/>
<br/>
Two hooks can be used to control how messages are displayed. The<br/>
first hook, `mh-show-mode-hook', is called early on in the<br/>
process of the message display. It is usually used to perform<br/>
some action on the message's content. The second hook,<br/>
`mh-show-hook', is the last thing called after messages are<br/>
displayed. It's used to affect the behavior of MH-E in general or<br/>
when `mh-show-mode-hook' is too early.<br/>
<br/>
From a program, optional argument MESSAGE can be used to display an<br/>
alternative message. The optional argument REDISPLAY-FLAG forces the<br/>
redisplay of the message even if the show buffer was already<br/>
displaying the correct message.<br/>
<br/>
See the "mh-show" customization group for a litany of options that<br/>
control what displayed messages look like.
