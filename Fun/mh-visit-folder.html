<strong>mh-visit-folder</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mh-visit-folder FOLDER &optional RANGE INDEX-DATA)<br/>
<br/>
Visit FOLDER.<br/>
<br/>
When you want to read the messages that you have refiled into folders,<br/>
use this command to visit the folder. You are prompted for the folder<br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
The folder buffer will show just unseen messages if there are any;<br/>
otherwise, it will show all the messages in the buffer as long there<br/>
are fewer than `mh-large-folder' messages. If there are more, then you<br/>
are prompted for a range of messages to scan.<br/>
<br/>
You can provide a prefix argument in order to specify a RANGE of<br/>
messages to show when you visit the folder. In this case, regions are<br/>
not used to specify the range and `mh-large-folder' is ignored. Check<br/>
the documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how RANGE is read<br/>
in interactive use.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this command can also be used to create folders. If you<br/>
specify a folder that does not exist, you will be prompted to create<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Do not call this function from outside MH-E; use M-x mh-rmail instead.<br/>
<br/>
If, in a program, RANGE is nil (the default), then all messages in<br/>
FOLDER are displayed. If an index buffer is being created then<br/>
INDEX-DATA is used to initialize the index buffer specific data<br/>
structures.
