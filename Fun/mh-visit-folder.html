<strong>mh-visit-folder</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mh-folder.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mh-visit-folder <u>FOLDER</u> &optional <u>RANGE</u> <u>INDEX-DATA</u>)</br>
</br>
Visit <u>FOLDER</u>.</br>
</br>
When you want to read the messages that you have refiled into folders,</br>
use this command to visit the folder. You are prompted for the folder</br>
name.</br>
</br>
The folder buffer will show just unseen messages if there are any;</br>
otherwise, it will show all the messages in the buffer as long there</br>
are fewer than `mh-large-folder' messages. If there are more, then you</br>
are prompted for a range of messages to scan.</br>
</br>
You can provide a prefix argument in order to specify a <u>RANGE</u> of</br>
messages to show when you visit the folder. In this case, regions are</br>
not used to specify the range and `mh-large-folder' is ignored. Check</br>
the documentation of `mh-interactive-range' to see how <u>RANGE</u> is read</br>
in interactive use.</br>
</br>
Note that this command can also be used to create folders. If you</br>
specify a folder that does not exist, you will be prompted to create</br>
it.</br>
</br>
Do not call this function from outside MH-E; use M-x mh-rmail instead.</br>
</br>
If, in a program, <u>RANGE</u> is nil (the default), then all messages in</br>
<u>FOLDER</u> are displayed. If an index buffer is being created then</br>
<u>INDEX-DATA</u> is used to initialize the index buffer specific data</br>
structures.
