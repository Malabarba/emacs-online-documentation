</br>
</br>
(mh-yank-cur-msg)</br>
</br>
Insert the current message into the draft buffer.</br>
</br>
It is often useful to insert a snippet of text from a letter that</br>
someone mailed to provide some context for your reply. This</br>
command does this by adding an attribution, yanking a portion of</br>
text from the message to which you're replying, and inserting</br>
`mh-ins-buf-prefix' (`> ') before each line.</br>
</br>
The attribution consists of the sender's name and email address</br>
followed by the content of the option</br>
`mh-extract-from-attribution-verb'.</br>
</br>
You can also turn on the option</br>
`mh-delete-yanked-msg-window-flag' to delete the window</br>
containing the original message after yanking it to make more</br>
room on your screen for your reply.</br>
</br>
You can control how the message to which you are replying is</br>
yanked into your reply using `mh-yank-behavior'.</br>
</br>
If this isn't enough, you can gain full control over the</br>
appearance of the included text by setting `mail-citation-hook'</br>
to a function that modifies it. For example, if you set this hook</br>
to `trivial-cite' (which is NOT part of Emacs), set</br>
`mh-yank-behavior' to "Body and Header" (see URL</br>
`http://shasta.cs.uiuc.edu/~lrclause/tc.html').</br>
</br>
Note that if `mail-citation-hook' is set, `mh-ins-buf-prefix' is</br>
not inserted. If the option `mh-yank-behavior' is set to one of</br>
the supercite flavors, the hook `mail-citation-hook' is ignored</br>
and `mh-ins-buf-prefix' is not inserted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
