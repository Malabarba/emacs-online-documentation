<strong>minor-mode-key-binding</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(minor-mode-key-binding KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)<br/>
<br/>
Find the visible minor mode bindings of KEY.<br/>
Return an alist of pairs (MODENAME . BINDING), where MODENAME is<br/>
the symbol which names the minor mode binding KEY, and BINDING is<br/>
KEY's definition in that mode.  In particular, if KEY has no<br/>
minor-mode bindings, return nil.  If the first binding is a<br/>
non-prefix, all subsequent bindings will be omitted, since they would<br/>
be ignored.  Similarly, the list doesn't include non-prefix bindings<br/>
that come after prefix bindings.<br/>
<br/>
If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default<br/>
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.
