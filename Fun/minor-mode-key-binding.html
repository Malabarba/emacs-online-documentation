<strong>minor-mode-key-binding</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(minor-mode-key-binding <u>KEY</u> &optional <u>ACCEPT-DEFAULT</u>)</br>
</br>
Find the visible minor mode bindings of <u>KEY</u>.</br>
Return an alist of pairs (MODENAME . BINDING), where MODENAME is</br>
the symbol which names the minor mode binding <u>KEY</u>, and BINDING is</br>
<u>KEY</u>'s definition in that mode.  In particular, if <u>KEY</u> has no</br>
minor-mode bindings, return nil.  If the first binding is a</br>
non-prefix, all subsequent bindings will be omitted, since they would</br>
be ignored.  Similarly, the list doesn't include non-prefix bindings</br>
that come after prefix bindings.</br>
</br>
If optional argument <u>ACCEPT-DEFAULT</u> is non-nil, recognize default</br>
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.
