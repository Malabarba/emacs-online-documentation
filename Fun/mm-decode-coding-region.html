<strong>mm-decode-coding-region</strong> is an alias for `decode-coding-region' in `<code>mm-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mm-decode-coding-region START END CODING-SYSTEM &optional DESTINATION)<br/>
<br/>
Decode the current region from the specified coding system.<br/>
When called from a program, takes four arguments:<br/>
	START, END, CODING-SYSTEM, and DESTINATION.<br/>
START and END are buffer positions.<br/>
<br/>
Optional 4th arguments DESTINATION specifies where the decoded text goes.<br/>
If nil, the region between START and END is replaced by the decoded text.<br/>
If buffer, the decoded text is inserted in that buffer after point (point<br/>
does not move).<br/>
In those cases, the length of the decoded text is returned.<br/>
If DESTINATION is t, the decoded text is returned.<br/>
<br/>
This function sets `last-coding-system-used' to the precise coding system<br/>
used (which may be different from CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM is<br/>
not fully specified.)
