<strong>mm-insert-byte</strong> is an alias for `insert-byte' in `<code>mm-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mm-insert-byte BYTE COUNT &optional INHERIT)<br/>
<br/>
Insert COUNT (second arg) copies of BYTE (first arg).<br/>
Both arguments are required.<br/>
BYTE is a number of the range 0..255.<br/>
<br/>
If BYTE is 128..255 and the current buffer is multibyte, the<br/>
corresponding eight-bit character is inserted.<br/>
<br/>
Point, and before-insertion markers, are relocated as in the function `insert'.<br/>
The optional third arg INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text properties<br/>
from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.
