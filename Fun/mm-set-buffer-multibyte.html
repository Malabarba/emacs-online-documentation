mm-set-buffer-multibyte is an alias for `set-buffer-multibyte' in `mm-util.el'.<br/><br/>(mm-set-buffer-multibyte FLAG)<br/><br/>Set the multibyte flag of the current buffer to FLAG.<br/>If FLAG is t, this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer.<br/>If FLAG is nil, this makes the buffer a single-byte buffer.<br/>In these cases, the buffer contents remain unchanged as a sequence of<br/>bytes but the contents viewed as characters do change.<br/>If FLAG is `to', this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer by changing<br/>all eight-bit bytes to eight-bit characters.<br/>If the multibyte flag was really changed, undo information of the<br/>current buffer is cleared.
