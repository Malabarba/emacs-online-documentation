<strong>mm-set-buffer-multibyte</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/set-buffer-multibyte.html">set-buffer-multibyte</a></strong>' in `<code>mm-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mm-set-buffer-multibyte <u>FLAG</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the multibyte flag of the current buffer to <u>FLAG</u>.</br>
If <u>FLAG</u> is t, this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer.</br>
If <u>FLAG</u> is nil, this makes the buffer a single-byte buffer.</br>
In these cases, the buffer contents remain unchanged as a sequence of</br>
bytes but the contents viewed as characters do change.</br>
If <u>FLAG</u> is `to', this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer by changing</br>
all eight-bit bytes to eight-bit characters.</br>
If the multibyte flag was really changed, undo information of the</br>
current buffer is cleared.
