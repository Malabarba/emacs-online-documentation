<strong>mm-string-as-multibyte</strong> is an alias for `string-as-multibyte' in `<code>mm-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mm-string-as-multibyte STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual bytes as STRING.<br/>
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.<br/>
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.<br/>
<br/>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an individual 8-bit byte (i.e. not<br/>
part of a correct utf-8 sequence), it is converted to the corresponding<br/>
multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.<br/>
See also `string-to-multibyte'.<br/>
<br/>
Beware, this often doesn't really do what you think it does.<br/>
It is similar to (decode-coding-string STRING 'utf-8-emacs).<br/>
If you're not sure, whether to use `string-as-multibyte' or<br/>
`string-to-multibyte', use `string-to-multibyte'.
