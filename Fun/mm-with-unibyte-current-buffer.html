<strong>mm-with-unibyte-current-buffer</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>mm-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mm-with-unibyte-current-buffer &rest <u>FORMS</u>)</br>
</br>
This macro is obsolete since 25.1.</br>
</br>
Evaluate <u>FORMS</u> with current buffer temporarily made unibyte.</br>
Equivalent to `progn' in XEmacs.</br>
</br>
Note: We recommend not using this macro any more; there should be</br>
better ways to do a similar thing.  The previous version of this macro</br>
bound the default value of `enable-multibyte-characters' to nil while</br>
evaluating <u>FORMS</u> but it is no longer done.  So, some programs assuming</br>
it if any may malfunction.
