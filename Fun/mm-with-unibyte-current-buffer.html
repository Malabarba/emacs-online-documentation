mm-with-unibyte-current-buffer is a Lisp macro in `mm-util.el'.<br/><br/>(mm-with-unibyte-current-buffer &rest FORMS)<br/><br/>Evaluate FORMS with current buffer temporarily made unibyte.<br/>Equivalent to `progn' in XEmacs.<br/><br/>Note: We recommend not using this macro any more; there should be<br/>better ways to do a similar thing.  The previous version of this macro<br/>bound the default value of `enable-multibyte-characters' to nil while<br/>evaluating FORMS but it is no longer done.  So, some programs assuming<br/>it if any may malfunction.
