<strong>mm-xemacs-find-mime-charset-1</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mm-util.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mm-xemacs-find-mime-charset-1 <u>BEGIN</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Determine which MIME charset to use to send region as message.</br>
This uses the XEmacs-specific latin-unity package to better handle the</br>
case where identical characters from diverse ISO-8859-? character sets</br>
can be encoded using a single one of the corresponding coding systems.</br>
</br>
It treats `mm-coding-system-priorities' as the list of preferred</br>
coding systems; a useful example setting for this list in Western</br>
Europe would be '(iso-8859-1 iso-8859-15 utf-8), which would default</br>
to the very standard Latin 1 coding system, and only move to coding</br>
systems that are less supported as is necessary to encode the</br>
characters that exist in the buffer.</br>
</br>
Latin Unity doesn't know about those non-ASCII Roman characters that</br>
are available in various East Asian character sets.  As such, its</br>
behavior if you have a JIS 0212 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE in a</br>
buffer and it can otherwise be encoded as Latin 1, won't be ideal.</br>
But this is very much a corner case, so don't worry about it.
