<strong>modify-frame-parameters</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(modify-frame-parameters FRAME ALIST)<br/>
<br/>
Modify the parameters of frame FRAME according to ALIST.<br/>
If FRAME is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.<br/>
ALIST is an alist of parameters to change and their new values.<br/>
Each element of ALIST has the form (PARM . VALUE), where PARM is a symbol.<br/>
The meaningful PARMs depend on the kind of frame.<br/>
Undefined PARMs are ignored, but stored in the frame's parameter list<br/>
so that `frame-parameters' will return them.<br/>
<br/>
The value of frame parameter FOO can also be accessed<br/>
as a frame-local binding for the variable FOO, if you have<br/>
enabled such bindings for that variable with `make-variable-frame-local'.<br/>
Note that this functionality is obsolete as of Emacs 22.2, and its<br/>
use is not recommended.  Explicitly check for a frame-parameter instead.
