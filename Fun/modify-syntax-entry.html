<strong>modify-syntax-entry</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(modify-syntax-entry CHAR NEWENTRY &optional SYNTAX-TABLE)<br/>
<br/>
Set syntax for character CHAR according to string NEWENTRY.<br/>
The syntax is changed only for table SYNTAX-TABLE, which defaults to<br/>
 the current buffer's syntax table.<br/>
CHAR may be a cons (MIN . MAX), in which case, syntaxes of all characters<br/>
in the range MIN to MAX are changed.<br/>
The first character of NEWENTRY should be one of the following:<br/>
  Space or -  whitespace syntax.    w   word constituent.<br/>
  _           symbol constituent.   .   punctuation.<br/>
  (           open-parenthesis.     )   close-parenthesis.<br/>
  "           string quote.         \   escape.<br/>
  $           paired delimiter.     '   expression quote or prefix operator.<br/>
  <           comment starter.      >   comment ender.<br/>
  /           character-quote.      @   inherit from parent table.<br/>
  |           generic string fence. !   generic comment fence.<br/>
<br/>
Only single-character comment start and end sequences are represented thus.<br/>
Two-character sequences are represented as described below.<br/>
The second character of NEWENTRY is the matching parenthesis,<br/>
 used only if the first character is `(' or `)'.<br/>
Any additional characters are flags.<br/>
Defined flags are the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, b, p, and n.<br/>
 1 means CHAR is the start of a two-char comment start sequence.<br/>
 2 means CHAR is the second character of such a sequence.<br/>
 3 means CHAR is the start of a two-char comment end sequence.<br/>
 4 means CHAR is the second character of such a sequence.<br/>
<br/>
There can be several orthogonal comment sequences.  This is to support<br/>
language modes such as C++.  By default, all comment sequences are of style<br/>
a, but you can set the comment sequence style to b (on the second character<br/>
of a comment-start, and the first character of a comment-end sequence) and/or<br/>
c (on any of its chars) using this flag:<br/>
 b means CHAR is part of comment sequence b.<br/>
 c means CHAR is part of comment sequence c.<br/>
 n means CHAR is part of a nestable comment sequence.<br/>
<br/>
 p means CHAR is a prefix character for `backward-prefix-chars';<br/>
   such characters are treated as whitespace when they occur<br/>
   between expressions.
