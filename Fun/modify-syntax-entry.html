<strong>modify-syntax-entry</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(modify-syntax-entry <u>CHAR</u> <u>NEWENTRY</u> &optional <u>SYNTAX-TABLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Set syntax for character <u>CHAR</u> according to string <u>NEWENTRY</u>.</br>
The syntax is changed only for table <u>SYNTAX-TABLE</u>, which defaults to</br>
 the current buffer's syntax table.</br>
<u>CHAR</u> may be a cons (MIN . MAX), in which case, syntaxes of all characters</br>
in the range MIN to MAX are changed.</br>
The first character of <u>NEWENTRY</u> should be one of the following:</br>
  Space or -  whitespace syntax.    w   word constituent.</br>
  _           symbol constituent.   .   punctuation.</br>
  (           open-parenthesis.     )   close-parenthesis.</br>
  "           string quote.         \   escape.</br>
  $           paired delimiter.     '   expression quote or prefix operator.</br>
  &lt;           comment starter.      >   comment ender.</br>
  /           character-quote.      @   inherit from parent table.</br>
  |           generic string fence. !   generic comment fence.</br>
</br>
Only single-character comment start and end sequences are represented thus.</br>
Two-character sequences are represented as described below.</br>
The second character of <u>NEWENTRY</u> is the matching parenthesis,</br>
 used only if the first character is `(' or `)'.</br>
Any additional characters are flags.</br>
Defined flags are the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, b, p, and n.</br>
 1 means <u>CHAR</u> is the start of a two-char comment start sequence.</br>
 2 means <u>CHAR</u> is the second character of such a sequence.</br>
 3 means <u>CHAR</u> is the start of a two-char comment end sequence.</br>
 4 means <u>CHAR</u> is the second character of such a sequence.</br>
</br>
There can be several orthogonal comment sequences.  This is to support</br>
language modes such as C++.  By default, all comment sequences are of style</br>
a, but you can set the comment sequence style to b (on the second character</br>
of a comment-start, and the first character of a comment-end sequence) and/or</br>
c (on any of its chars) using this flag:</br>
 b means <u>CHAR</u> is part of comment sequence b.</br>
 c means <u>CHAR</u> is part of comment sequence c.</br>
 n means <u>CHAR</u> is part of a nestable comment sequence.</br>
</br>
 p means <u>CHAR</u> is a prefix character for `backward-prefix-chars';</br>
   such characters are treated as whitespace when they occur</br>
   between expressions.
