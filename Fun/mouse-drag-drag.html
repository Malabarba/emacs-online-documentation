<strong>mouse-drag-drag</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse-drag.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mouse-drag-drag START-EVENT)<br/>
<br/>
"Drag" the page according to a mouse drag.<br/>
<br/>
Drag scrolling moves the page according to the movement of the mouse.<br/>
You "grab" the character under the mouse and move it around.<br/>
<br/>
If the mouse is clicked and released in the same place of time we<br/>
assume that the user didn't want to scroll but wanted to whatever<br/>
mouse-2 used to do, so we pass it through.<br/>
<br/>
Drag scrolling is identical to the "hand" option in MacPaint, or the<br/>
middle button in Tk text widgets.<br/>
<br/>
