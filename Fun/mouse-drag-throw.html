mouse-drag-throw is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `mouse-drag.el'.<br/><br/>(mouse-drag-throw START-EVENT)<br/><br/>"Throw" the page according to a mouse drag.<br/><br/>A "throw" is scrolling the page at a speed relative to the distance<br/>from the original mouse click to the current mouse location.  Try it;<br/>you'll like it.  It's easier to observe than to explain.<br/><br/>If the mouse is clicked and released in the same place of time we<br/>assume that the user didn't want to scroll but wanted to whatever<br/>mouse-2 used to do, so we pass it through.<br/><br/>Throw scrolling was inspired (but is not identical to) the "hand"<br/>option in MacPaint, or the middle button in Tk text widgets.<br/><br/>If `mouse-throw-with-scroll-bar' is non-nil, then this command scrolls<br/>in the opposite direction.  (Different people have different ideas<br/>about which direction is natural.  Perhaps it has to do with which<br/>hemisphere you're in.)<br/><br/>To test this function, evaluate:<br/>    (global-set-key [down-mouse-2] 'mouse-drag-throw)
