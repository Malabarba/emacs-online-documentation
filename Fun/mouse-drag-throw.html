</br>
</br>
(mouse-drag-throw <u>START-EVENT</u>)</br>
</br>
"Throw" the page according to a mouse drag.</br>
</br>
A "throw" is scrolling the page at a speed relative to the distance</br>
from the original mouse click to the current mouse location.  Try it;</br>
you'll like it.  It's easier to observe than to explain.</br>
</br>
If the mouse is clicked and released in the same place of time we</br>
assume that the user didn't want to scroll but wanted to whatever</br>
mouse-2 used to do, so we pass it through.</br>
</br>
Throw scrolling was inspired (but is not identical to) the "hand"</br>
option in MacPaint, or the middle button in Tk text widgets.</br>
</br>
If `mouse-throw-with-scroll-bar' is non-nil, then this command scrolls</br>
in the opposite direction.  (Different people have different ideas</br>
about which direction is natural.  Perhaps it has to do with which</br>
hemisphere you're in.)</br>
