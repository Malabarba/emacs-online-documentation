<strong>mouse-kill-preserving-secondary</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse-copy.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(mouse-kill-preserving-secondary)</br>
</br>
Kill the text in the secondary selection, but leave the selection set.</br>
</br>
This command is like M-x mouse-kill-secondary (that is, the secondary</br>
selection is deleted and placed in the kill ring), except that it also</br>
leaves the secondary buffer active on exit.</br>
</br>
This command was derived from mouse-kill-secondary in emacs-19.28</br>
by johnh@ficus.cs.ucla.edu.
