<strong>mouse-kill-secondary</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mouse-kill-secondary)<br/>
<br/>
Kill the text in the secondary selection.<br/>
This is intended more as a keyboard command than as a mouse command<br/>
but it can work as either one.<br/>
<br/>
The current buffer (in case of keyboard use), or the buffer clicked on,<br/>
must be the one that the secondary selection is in.  This requirement<br/>
is to prevent accidents.
