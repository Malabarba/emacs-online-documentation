<strong>mouse-on-link-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mouse-on-link-p POS)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if POS is on a link in the current buffer.<br/>
POS must be a buffer position in the current buffer or a mouse<br/>
event location in the selected window (see `event-start').<br/>
However, if `mouse-1-click-in-non-selected-windows' is non-nil,<br/>
POS may be a mouse event location in any window.<br/>
<br/>
A clickable link is identified by one of the following methods:<br/>
<br/>
- If the character at POS has a non-nil `follow-link' text or<br/>
overlay property, the value of that property determines what to do.<br/>
<br/>
- If there is a local key-binding or a keybinding at position POS<br/>
for the `follow-link' event, the binding of that event determines<br/>
what to do.<br/>
<br/>
The resulting value determine whether POS is inside a link:<br/>
<br/>
- If the value is `mouse-face', POS is inside a link if there<br/>
is a non-nil `mouse-face' property at POS.  Return t in this case.<br/>
<br/>
- If the value is a function, FUNC, POS is inside a link if<br/>
the call (FUNC POS) returns non-nil.  Return the return value<br/>
from that call.  Arg is (posn-point POS) if POS is a mouse event.<br/>
<br/>
- Otherwise, return the value itself.<br/>
<br/>
The return value is interpreted as follows:<br/>
<br/>
- If it is a string, the mouse-1 event is translated into the<br/>
first character of the string, i.e. the action of the mouse-1<br/>
click is the local or global binding of that character.<br/>
<br/>
- If it is a vector, the mouse-1 event is translated into the<br/>
first element of that vector, i.e. the action of the mouse-1<br/>
click is the local or global binding of that event.<br/>
<br/>
- Otherwise, the mouse-1 event is translated into a mouse-2 event<br/>
at the same position.
