<strong>mouse-pixel-position</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mouse-pixel-position)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list (FRAME X . Y) giving the current mouse frame and position.<br/>
The position is given in pixel units, where (0, 0) is the<br/>
upper-left corner of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is<br/>
the vertical offset.<br/>
If Emacs is running on a mouseless terminal or hasn't been programmed<br/>
to read the mouse position, it returns the selected frame for FRAME<br/>
and nil for X and Y.
