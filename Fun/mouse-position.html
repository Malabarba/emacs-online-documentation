<strong>mouse-position</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mouse-position)</br>
</br>
Return a list (FRAME X . Y) giving the current mouse frame and position.</br>
The position is given in canonical character cells, where (0, 0) is the</br>
upper-left corner of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is the</br>
vertical offset, measured in units of the frame's default character size.</br>
If Emacs is running on a mouseless terminal or hasn't been programmed</br>
to read the mouse position, it returns the selected frame for FRAME</br>
and nil for X and Y.</br>
If `mouse-position-function' is non-nil, `mouse-position' calls it,</br>
passing the normal return value to that function as an argument,</br>
and returns whatever that function returns.
