<strong>mouse-posn-property</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(mouse-posn-property <u>POS</u> <u>PROPERTY</u>)</br>
</br>
Look for a property at click position.</br>
<u>POS</u> may be either a buffer position or a click position like</br>
those returned from `event-start'.  If the click position is on</br>
a string, the text property <u>PROPERTY</u> is examined.</br>
If this is nil or the click is not on a string, then</br>
the corresponding buffer position is searched for <u>PROPERTY</u>.</br>
If <u>PROPERTY</u> is encountered in one of those places,</br>
its value is returned.
