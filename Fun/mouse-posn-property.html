<strong>mouse-posn-property</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(mouse-posn-property POS PROPERTY)<br/>
<br/>
Look for a property at click position.<br/>
POS may be either a buffer position or a click position like<br/>
those returned from `event-start'.  If the click position is on<br/>
a string, the text property PROPERTY is examined.<br/>
If this is nil or the click is not on a string, then<br/>
the corresponding buffer position is searched for PROPERTY.<br/>
If PROPERTY is encountered in one of those places,<br/>
its value is returned.
