<strong>mouse-save-then-kill</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;mouse-3>.</br>
</br>
<code>(mouse-save-then-kill <u>CLICK</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Set the region according to <u>CLICK</u>; the second time, kill it.</br>
<u>CLICK</u> should be a mouse click event.</br>
</br>
If the region is inactive, activate it temporarily.  Set mark at</br>
the original point, and move point to the position of <u>CLICK</u>.</br>
</br>
If the region is already active, adjust it.  Normally, do this by</br>
moving point or mark, whichever is closer, to <u>CLICK</u>.  But if you</br>
have selected whole words or lines, move point or mark to the</br>
word or line boundary closest to <u>CLICK</u> instead.</br>
</br>
If `mouse-drag-copy-region' is non-nil, this command also saves the</br>
new region to the kill ring (replacing the previous kill if the</br>
previous region was just saved to the kill ring).</br>
</br>
If this command is called a second consecutive time with the same</br>
<u>CLICK</u> position, kill the region (or delete it</br>
if `mouse-drag-copy-region' is non-nil)
