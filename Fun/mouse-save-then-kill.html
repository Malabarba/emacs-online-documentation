mouse-save-then-kill is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `mouse.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <mouse-3>.<br/><br/>(mouse-save-then-kill CLICK)<br/><br/>Set the region according to CLICK; the second time, kill it.<br/>CLICK should be a mouse click event.<br/><br/>If the region is inactive, activate it temporarily.  Set mark at<br/>the original point, and move point to the position of CLICK.<br/><br/>If the region is already active, adjust it.  Normally, do this by<br/>moving point or mark, whichever is closer, to CLICK.  But if you<br/>have selected whole words or lines, move point or mark to the<br/>word or line boundary closest to CLICK instead.<br/><br/>If `mouse-drag-copy-region' is non-nil, this command also saves the<br/>new region to the kill ring (replacing the previous kill if the<br/>previous region was just saved to the kill ring).<br/><br/>If this command is called a second consecutive time with the same<br/>CLICK position, kill the region (or delete it<br/>if `mouse-drag-copy-region' is non-nil)
