<strong>mouse-secondary-save-then-kill</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mouse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;M-mouse-3>.</br>
</br>
<code>(mouse-secondary-save-then-kill <u>CLICK</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Set the secondary selection and save it to the kill ring.</br>
The second time, kill it.  <u>CLICK</u> should be a mouse click event.</br>
</br>
If you have not called `mouse-start-secondary' in the clicked</br>
buffer, activate the secondary selection and set it between point</br>
and the click position <u>CLICK</u>.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, adjust the bounds of the secondary selection.</br>
Normally, do this by moving its beginning or end, whichever is</br>
closer, to <u>CLICK</u>.  But if you have selected whole words or lines,</br>
adjust to the word or line boundary closest to <u>CLICK</u> instead.</br>
</br>
If this command is called a second consecutive time with the same</br>
<u>CLICK</u> position, kill the secondary selection.
