mouse-secondary-save-then-kill is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `mouse.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <M-mouse-3>.<br/><br/>(mouse-secondary-save-then-kill CLICK)<br/><br/>Set the secondary selection and save it to the kill ring.<br/>The second time, kill it.  CLICK should be a mouse click event.<br/><br/>If you have not called `mouse-start-secondary' in the clicked<br/>buffer, activate the secondary selection and set it between point<br/>and the click position CLICK.<br/><br/>Otherwise, adjust the bounds of the secondary selection.<br/>Normally, do this by moving its beginning or end, whichever is<br/>closer, to CLICK.  But if you have selected whole words or lines,<br/>adjust to the word or line boundary closest to CLICK instead.<br/><br/>If this command is called a second consecutive time with the same<br/>CLICK position, kill the secondary selection.
