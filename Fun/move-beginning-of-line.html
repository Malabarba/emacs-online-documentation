<strong>move-beginning-of-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-a, <home>.<br/>
<br/>
(move-beginning-of-line ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Move point to beginning of current line as displayed.<br/>
(If there's an image in the line, this disregards newlines<br/>
which are part of the text that the image rests on.)<br/>
<br/>
With argument ARG not nil or 1, move forward ARG - 1 lines first.<br/>
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.<br/>
To ignore intangibility, bind `inhibit-point-motion-hooks' to t.
