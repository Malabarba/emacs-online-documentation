<strong>multiple-value-bind</strong> is an alias for `cl-multiple-value-bind' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(multiple-value-bind (SYM...) FORM BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Collect multiple return values.<br/>
FORM must return a list; the BODY is then executed with the first N elements<br/>
of this list bound (`let'-style) to each of the symbols SYM in turn.  This<br/>
is analogous to the Common Lisp `cl-multiple-value-bind' macro, using lists to<br/>
simulate true multiple return values.  For compatibility, (cl-values A B C) is<br/>
a synonym for (list A B C).
