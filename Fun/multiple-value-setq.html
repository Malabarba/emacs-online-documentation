multiple-value-setq is an alias for `cl-multiple-value-setq' in `cl.el'.<br/><br/>(multiple-value-setq (SYM...) FORM)<br/><br/>Collect multiple return values.<br/>FORM must return a list; the first N elements of this list are stored in<br/>each of the symbols SYM in turn.  This is analogous to the Common Lisp<br/>`cl-multiple-value-setq' macro, using lists to simulate true multiple return<br/>values.  For compatibility, (cl-values A B C) is a synonym for (list A B C).
