<strong>narrow-to-region</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x n n.</br>
</br>
<code>(narrow-to-region <u>START</u> <u>END</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Restrict editing in this buffer to the current region.</br>
The rest of the text becomes temporarily invisible and untouchable</br>
but is not deleted; if you save the buffer in a file, the invisible</br>
text is included in the file.  C-x n w makes all visible again.</br>
See also `save-restriction'.</br>
</br>
When calling from a program, pass two arguments; positions (integers</br>
or markers) bounding the text that should remain visible.
