<strong>newsticker--cache-contains</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>newst-backend.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(newsticker--cache-contains DATA FEED TITLE DESC LINK AGE &optional GUID)<br/>
<br/>
Check DATA whether FEED contains an item with the given properties.<br/>
This function returns the contained item or nil if it is not<br/>
contained.<br/>
The properties which are checked are TITLE, DESC, LINK, AGE, and<br/>
GUID.  In general all properties must match in order to return a<br/>
certain item, except for the following cases.<br/>
<br/>
If AGE equals 'feed the TITLE, DESCription and LINK do not<br/>
matter.  If DESC is nil it is ignored as well.  If<br/>
`newsticker-desc-comp-max' is non-nil, only the first<br/>
`newsticker-desc-comp-max' characters of DESC are taken into<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
If GUID is non-nil it is sufficient to match this value, and the<br/>
other properties are ignored.
