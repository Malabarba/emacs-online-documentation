<strong>next-error-buffer-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(next-error-buffer-p BUFFER &optional AVOID-CURRENT EXTRA-TEST-INCLUSIVE EXTRA-TEST-EXCLUSIVE)<br/>
<br/>
Test if BUFFER is a `next-error' capable buffer.<br/>
<br/>
If AVOID-CURRENT is non-nil, treat the current buffer<br/>
as an absolute last resort only.<br/>
<br/>
The function EXTRA-TEST-INCLUSIVE, if non-nil, is called in each buffer<br/>
that normally would not qualify.  If it returns t, the buffer<br/>
in question is treated as usable.<br/>
<br/>
The function EXTRA-TEST-EXCLUSIVE, if non-nil, is called in each buffer<br/>
that would normally be considered usable.  If it returns nil,<br/>
that buffer is rejected.
