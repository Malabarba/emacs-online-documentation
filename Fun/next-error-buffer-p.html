<strong>next-error-buffer-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(next-error-buffer-p <u>BUFFER</u> &optional <u>AVOID-CURRENT</u> <u>EXTRA-TEST-INCLUSIVE</u> <u>EXTRA-TEST-EXCLUSIVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Test if <u>BUFFER</u> is a `next-error' capable buffer.</br>
</br>
If <u>AVOID-CURRENT</u> is non-nil, treat the current buffer</br>
as an absolute last resort only.</br>
</br>
The function <u>EXTRA-TEST-INCLUSIVE</u>, if non-nil, is called in each buffer</br>
that normally would not qualify.  If it returns t, the buffer</br>
in question is treated as usable.</br>
</br>
The function <u>EXTRA-TEST-EXCLUSIVE</u>, if non-nil, is called in each buffer</br>
that would normally be considered usable.  If it returns nil,</br>
that buffer is rejected.
