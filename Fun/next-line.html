<strong>next-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-n, <down>.<br/>
<br/>
(next-line &optional ARG TRY-VSCROLL)<br/>
<br/>
Move cursor vertically down ARG lines.<br/>
Interactively, vscroll tall lines if `auto-window-vscroll' is enabled.<br/>
If there is no character in the target line exactly under the current column,<br/>
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this<br/>
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.<br/>
If there is no line in the buffer after this one, behavior depends on the<br/>
value of `next-line-add-newlines'.  If non-nil, it inserts a newline character<br/>
to create a line, and moves the cursor to that line.  Otherwise it moves the<br/>
cursor to the end of the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
If the variable `line-move-visual' is non-nil, this command moves<br/>
by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without<br/>
taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.<br/>
<br/>
The command C-x C-n can be used to create<br/>
a semipermanent goal column for this command.<br/>
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),<br/>
this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).<br/>
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil<br/>
when there is no goal column.  Note that setting `goal-column'<br/>
overrides `line-move-visual' and causes this command to move by buffer<br/>
lines rather than by display lines.<br/>
<br/>
If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider<br/>
using `forward-line' instead.  It is usually easier to use<br/>
and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).
