<strong>next-line</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-n, &lt;down>.</br>
</br>
<code>(next-line <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u> <u>TRY-VSCROLL</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Move cursor vertically down <u>ARG</u> lines.</br>
Interactively, vscroll tall lines if `auto-window-vscroll' is enabled.</br>
Non-interactively, use <u>TRY-VSCROLL</u> to control whether to vscroll tall</br>
lines: if either `auto-window-vscroll' or <u>TRY-VSCROLL</u> is nil, this</br>
function will not vscroll.</br>
</br>
<u>ARG</u> defaults to 1.</br>
</br>
If there is no character in the target line exactly under the current column,</br>
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this</br>
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.</br>
If there is no line in the buffer after this one, behavior depends on the</br>
value of `next-line-add-newlines'.  If non-nil, it inserts a newline character</br>
to create a line, and moves the cursor to that line.  Otherwise it moves the</br>
cursor to the end of the buffer.</br>
</br>
If the variable `line-move-visual' is non-nil, this command moves</br>
by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without</br>
taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.</br>
</br>
The command C-x C-n can be used to create</br>
a semipermanent goal column for this command.</br>
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),</br>
this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).</br>
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil</br>
when there is no goal column.  Note that setting `goal-column'</br>
overrides `line-move-visual' and causes this command to move by buffer</br>
lines rather than by display lines.</br>
</br>
If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider</br>
using `forward-line' instead.  It is usually easier to use</br>
and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).
