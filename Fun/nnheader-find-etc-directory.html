<strong>nnheader-find-etc-directory</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>nnheader.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(nnheader-find-etc-directory PACKAGE &optional FILE FIRST)<br/>
<br/>
Go through `load-path' and find the "../etc/PACKAGE" directory.<br/>
This function will look in the parent directory of each `load-path'<br/>
entry, and look for the "etc" directory there.<br/>
If FILE, find the ".../etc/PACKAGE" file instead.<br/>
If FIRST is non-nil, return the directory or the file found at the<br/>
first.  Otherwise, find the newest one, though it may take a time.
