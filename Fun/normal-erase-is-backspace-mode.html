<!DOCTYPE html><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en-us"><head><style type="text/css"> @import url('http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual.css');</style></head><body style="padding:1rem;"><strong>normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(normal-erase-is-backspace-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle the Erase and Delete mode of the Backspace and Delete keys.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable this feature if <u>ARG</u> is</br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable</br>
the mode if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.</br>
</br>
On window systems, when this mode is on, Delete is mapped to C-d</br>
and Backspace is mapped to DEL; when this mode is off, both</br>
Delete and Backspace are mapped to DEL.  (The remapping goes via</br>
`local-function-key-map', so binding Delete or Backspace in the</br>
global or local keymap will override that.)</br>
</br>
In addition, on window systems, the bindings of C-Delete, M-Delete,</br>
C-M-Delete, C-Backspace, M-Backspace, and C-M-Backspace are changed in</br>
the global keymap in accordance with the functionality of Delete and</br>
Backspace.  For example, if Delete is remapped to C-d, which deletes</br>
forward, C-Delete is bound to `kill-word', but if Delete is remapped</br>
to DEL, which deletes backward, C-Delete is bound to</br>
`backward-kill-word'.</br>
</br>
If not running on a window system, a similar effect is accomplished by</br>
remapping C-h (normally produced by the Backspace key) and DEL via</br>
`keyboard-translate': if this mode is on, C-h is mapped to DEL and DEL</br>
to C-d; if it's off, the keys are not remapped.</br>
</br>
When not running on a window system, and this mode is turned on, the</br>
former functionality of C-h is available on the F1 key.  You should</br>
probably not turn on this mode on a text-only terminal if you don't</br>
have both Backspace, Delete and F1 keys.</br>
