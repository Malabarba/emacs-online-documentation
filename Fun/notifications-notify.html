 :title          The notification title.</br>
 :body           The notification body text.</br>
 :app-name       The name of the application sending the notification.</br>
                 Default to `notifications-application-name'.</br>
 :replaces-id    The notification ID that this notification replaces.</br>
 :app-icon       The notification icon.</br>
                 Default is `notifications-application-icon'.</br>

                   (KEY TITLE KEY TITLE ...)</br>
                 where KEY and TITLE are both strings.</br>
                 The default action (usually invoked by clicking the</br>
                 notification) should have a key named "default".</br>
                 The title can be anything, though implementations are free</br>
                 not to display it.</br>
 :timeout        The timeout time in milliseconds since the display</br>
                 of the notification at which the notification should</br>
                 automatically close.</br>
                 If -1, the notification's expiration time is dependent</br>
                 on the notification server's settings, and may vary for</br>
                 the type of notification.</br>
                 If 0, the notification never expires.</br>
                 Default value is -1.</br>
 :urgency        The urgency level.</br>
                 Either `low', `normal' or `critical'.</br>
 :action-items   Whether the TITLE of the actions is interpreted as</br>

                 height, rowstride, has alpha, bits per sample, channels and</br>
                 image data respectively.</br>
 :image-path     This is represented either as a URI (file:// is the</br>
                 only URI schema supported right now) or a name</br>
                 in a freedesktop.org-compliant icon theme.</br>
 :sound-file     The path to a sound file to play when the notification pops up.</br>
 :sound-name     A themable named sound from the freedesktop.org sound naming</br>
                 specification to play when the notification pops up.</br>
                 Similar to icon-name,only for sounds. An example would</br>
                 be "message-new-instant".</br>
 :suppress-sound Causes the server to suppress playing any sounds, if it has</br>
                 that ability.</br>
 :resident       When set the server will not automatically remove the</br>
                 notification when an action has been invoked.</br>
 :transient      When set the server will treat the notification as transient</br>
                 and by-pass the server's persistence capability, if it</br>
                 should exist.</br>
 :x              Specifies the X location on the screen that the notification</br>
                 should point to.  The "y" hint must also be specified.</br>
 :y              Specifies the Y location on the screen that the notification</br>
                 should point to.  The "x" hint must also be specified.</br>
 :on-action      Function to call when an action is invoked.</br>
                 The notification id and the key of the action are passed</br>
                 as arguments to the function.</br>
 :on-close       Function to call when the notification has been closed</br>
                 by timeout or by the user.</br>
                 The function receive the notification id and the closing</br>
                 reason as arguments:</br>
                   - `expired' if the notification has expired</br>
                   - `dismissed' if the notification was dismissed by the user</br>
                   - `close-notification' if the notification was closed</br>
                     by a call to CloseNotification</br>
                   - `undefined' if the notification server hasn't provided</br>
                     a reason</br>
</br>
Which parameters are accepted by the notification server can be</br>
checked via `notifications-get-capabilities'.</br>
</br>
This function returns a notification id, an integer, which can be</br>
used to manipulate the notification item with</br>
`notifications-close-notification' or the `:replaces-id' argument</br>
of another `notifications-notify' call.
