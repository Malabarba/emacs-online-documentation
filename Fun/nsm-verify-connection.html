<strong>nsm-verify-connection</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>nsm.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(nsm-verify-connection <u>PROCESS</u> <u>HOST</u> <u>PORT</u> &optional <u>SAVE-FINGERPRINT</u> <u>WARN-UNENCRYPTED</u>)</br>
</br>
Verify the security status of <u>PROCESS</u> that's connected to <u>HOST</u>:<u>PORT</u>.</br>
If <u>PROCESS</u> is a gnutls connection, the certificate validity will</br>
be examined.  If it's a non-TLS connection, it may be compared</br>
against previous connections.  If the function determines that</br>
there is something odd about the connection, the user will be</br>
queried about what to do about it.</br>
</br>
The process it returned if everything is OK, and otherwise, the</br>
process will be deleted and nil is returned.</br>
</br>
If <u>SAVE-FINGERPRINT</u>, always save the fingerprint of the</br>
server (if the connection is a TLS connection).  This is useful</br>
to keep track of the TLS status of STARTTLS servers.</br>
</br>
If <u>WARN-UNENCRYPTED</u>, query the user if the connection is</br>
unencrypted.
