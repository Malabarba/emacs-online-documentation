number-sequence is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(number-sequence FROM &optional TO INC)<br/><br/>Return a sequence of numbers from FROM to TO (both inclusive) as a list.<br/>INC is the increment used between numbers in the sequence and defaults to 1.<br/>So, the Nth element of the list is (+ FROM (* N INC)) where N counts from<br/>zero.  TO is only included if there is an N for which TO = FROM + N * INC.<br/>If TO is nil or numerically equal to FROM, return (FROM).<br/>If INC is positive and TO is less than FROM, or INC is negative<br/>and TO is larger than FROM, return nil.<br/>If INC is zero and TO is neither nil nor numerically equal to<br/>FROM, signal an error.<br/><br/>This function is primarily designed for integer arguments.<br/>Nevertheless, FROM, TO and INC can be integer or float.  However,<br/>floating point arithmetic is inexact.  For instance, depending on<br/>the machine, it may quite well happen that<br/>(number-sequence 0.4 0.6 0.2) returns the one element list (0.4),<br/>whereas (number-sequence 0.4 0.8 0.2) returns a list with three<br/>elements.  Thus, if some of the arguments are floats and one wants<br/>to make sure that TO is included, one may have to explicitly write<br/>TO as (+ FROM (* N INC)) or use a variable whose value was<br/>computed with this exact expression.  Alternatively, you can,<br/>of course, also replace TO with a slightly larger value<br/>(or a slightly more negative value if INC is negative).
