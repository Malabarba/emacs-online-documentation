nxml-dynamic-markup-word is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `nxml-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(nxml-dynamic-markup-word)<br/><br/>Dynamically markup the word before point.<br/>This attempts to find a tag to put around the word before point based<br/>on the contents of the current buffer. The end-tag will be inserted at<br/>point.  The start-tag will be inserted at or before the beginning of<br/>the word before point; the contents of the current buffer is used to<br/>decide where.<br/><br/>It works in a similar way to M-/.  It searches first<br/>backwards from point, then forwards from point for an element whose<br/>content is a string which matches the contents of the buffer before<br/>point and which includes at least the word before point.  It then<br/>copies the start- and end-tags from that element and uses them to<br/>surround the matching string before point.<br/><br/>Repeating M-x nxml-dynamic-markup-word immediately after successful<br/>M-x nxml-dynamic-markup-word removes the previously inserted markup<br/>and attempts to find another possible way to do the markup.
