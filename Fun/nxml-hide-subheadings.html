nxml-hide-subheadings is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `nxml-outln.el'.<br/><br/>(nxml-hide-subheadings)<br/><br/>Hide the subheadings that are part of the section containing point.<br/>The text content will also be hidden, leaving only the heading of the<br/>section itself visible.  The state of the subsections will also be<br/>changed to hide their headings, so that M-x nxml-show-direct-text-content<br/>would show only the heading of the subsections.  The section containing<br/>point is the innermost section that contains the character following<br/>point.  See the variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' for more<br/>details on how to customize which elements are recognized as sections<br/>and headings.
