nxml-parse-file is a compiled Lisp function in `nxml-parse.el'.<br/><br/>(nxml-parse-file FILE)<br/><br/>Parse the XML document in FILE and return it as a list.<br/>An XML element is represented as a list (NAME ATTRIBUTES . CHILDREN).<br/>NAME is either a string, in the case where the name does not have a<br/>namespace, or a cons (NAMESPACE . LOCAL-NAME), where NAMESPACE is a<br/>symbol and LOCAL-NAME is a string, in the case where the name does<br/>have a namespace.  NAMESPACE is a keyword whose name is `:URI', where<br/>URI is the namespace name.  ATTRIBUTES is an alist of attributes where<br/>each attribute has the form (NAME . VALUE), where NAME has the same<br/>form as an element name, and VALUE is a string.  A namespace<br/>declaration is represented as an attribute whose name is<br/>(:http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/ . LOCAL-NAME).  CHILDREN is a list<br/>containing strings and child elements; CHILDREN never contains two<br/>consecutive strings and never contains an empty string.  Processing<br/>instructions and comments are not represented.  The return value is a<br/>list representing the document element.<br/><br/>If the XML document is not well-formed, an error having the condition<br/>`nxml-file-parse-error' will be signaled; the error data will be a<br/>list of the form (FILE POSITION MESSAGE), where POSITION is an<br/>integer specifying the position where the error was detected, and<br/>MESSAGE is a string describing the error.<br/><br/>The current contents of FILE will be parsed even if there is a<br/>modified buffer currently visiting FILE.<br/><br/>If the variable `nxml-validate-function' is non-nil, it will be called<br/>twice for each element, and any reported error will be signaled in the<br/>same way as well-formedness error.
