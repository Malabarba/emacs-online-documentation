nxml-scan-element-backward is a compiled Lisp function in `nxml-rap.el'.<br/><br/>(nxml-scan-element-backward FROM &optional UP BOUND)<br/><br/>Scan backward from FROM over a single balanced element.<br/>Point must be between tokens.  Return the position of the end of<br/>the tag that starts the element. `xmltok-start' will contain the<br/>position of the start of the tag.  If UP is non-nil, then scan<br/>past start-tag of element containing point.  If BOUND is non-nil,<br/>then don't scan back past BOUND.  If no element is found, return<br/>nil.  If a well-formedness error prevents scanning, signal an<br/>`nxml-scan-error'.  Point is not moved.
