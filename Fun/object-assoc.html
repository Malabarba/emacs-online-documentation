<strong>object-assoc</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>eieio.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(object-assoc KEY SLOT LIST)<br/>
<br/>
Return an object if KEY is `equal' to SLOT's value of an object in LIST.<br/>
LIST is a list of objects whose slots are searched.<br/>
Objects in LIST do not need to have a slot named SLOT, nor does<br/>
SLOT need to be bound.  If these errors occur, those objects will<br/>
be ignored.
