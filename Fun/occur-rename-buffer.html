<strong>occur-rename-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(occur-rename-buffer &optional <u>UNIQUE-P</u> <u>INTERACTIVE-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Rename the current *Occur* buffer to *Occur: original-buffer-name*.</br>
Here `original-buffer-name' is the buffer name where Occur was originally run.</br>
When given the prefix argument, or called non-interactively, the renaming</br>
will not clobber the existing buffer(s) of that name, but use</br>
`generate-new-buffer-name' instead.  You can add this to `occur-hook'</br>
if you always want a separate *Occur* buffer for each buffer where you</br>
invoke `occur'.
