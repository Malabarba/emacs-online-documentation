occur-rename-buffer is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `replace.el'.<br/><br/>(occur-rename-buffer &optional UNIQUE-P INTERACTIVE-P)<br/><br/>Rename the current *Occur* buffer to *Occur: original-buffer-name*.<br/>Here `original-buffer-name' is the buffer name where Occur was originally run.<br/>When given the prefix argument, or called non-interactively, the renaming<br/>will not clobber the existing buffer(s) of that name, but use<br/>`generate-new-buffer-name' instead.  You can add this to `occur-hook'<br/>if you always want a separate *Occur* buffer for each buffer where you<br/>invoke `occur'.
