<strong>one-window-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(one-window-p &optional NOMINI ALL-FRAMES)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if the selected window is the only window.<br/>
Optional arg NOMINI non-nil means don't count the minibuffer<br/>
even if it is active.  Otherwise, the minibuffer is counted<br/>
when it is active.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument ALL-FRAMES specifies the set of frames to<br/>
consider, see also `next-window'.  ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted<br/>
means consider windows on the selected frame only, plus the<br/>
minibuffer window if specified by the NOMINI argument.  If the<br/>
minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all frames that share<br/>
that minibuffer too.  The remaining non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES<br/>
with a special meaning are:<br/>
<br/>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.<br/>
<br/>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on<br/>
  the current terminal.<br/>
<br/>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible<br/>
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.<br/>
<br/>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame<br/>
and no others.
