<strong>open-gnutls-stream</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>gnutls.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(open-gnutls-stream NAME BUFFER HOST SERVICE)<br/>
<br/>
Open a SSL/TLS connection for a service to a host.<br/>
Returns a subprocess-object to represent the connection.<br/>
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.<br/>
Args are NAME BUFFER HOST SERVICE.<br/>
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.<br/>
BUFFER is the buffer (or `buffer-name') to associate with the process.<br/>
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify<br/>
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.<br/>
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated<br/>
 with any buffer<br/>
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.<br/>
Fourth arg SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an integer<br/>
specifying a port number to connect to.<br/>
<br/>
Usage example:<br/>
<br/>
  (with-temp-buffer<br/>
    (open-gnutls-stream "tls"<br/>
                        (current-buffer)<br/>
                        "your server goes here"<br/>
                        "imaps"))<br/>
<br/>
This is a very simple wrapper around `gnutls-negotiate'.  See its<br/>
documentation for the specific parameters you can use to open a<br/>
GnuTLS connection, including specifying the credential type,<br/>
trust and key files, and priority string.
