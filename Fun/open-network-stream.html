<strong>open-network-stream</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>network-stream.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(open-network-stream <u>NAME</u> <u>BUFFER</u> <u>HOST</u> <u>SERVICE</u> &rest <u>PARAMETERS</u>)</br>
</br>
Open a TCP connection to <u>HOST</u>, optionally with encryption.</br>
Normally, return a network process object; with a non-nil</br>
:return-list parameter, return a list instead (see below).</br>
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process'</br>
closes it.</br>
</br>
<u>NAME</u> is the name for the process.  It is modified if necessary to</br>
 make it unique.</br>
<u>BUFFER</u> is a buffer or buffer name to associate with the process.</br>
 Process output goes at end of that buffer.  <u>BUFFER</u> may be nil,</br>
 meaning that the process is not associated with any buffer.</br>
<u>HOST</u> is the name or IP address of the host to connect to.</br>
<u>SERVICE</u> is the name of the service desired, or an integer specifying</br>
 a port number to connect to.</br>
</br>
The remaining <u>PARAMETERS</u> should be a sequence of keywords and</br>
values:</br>
</br>
:type specifies the connection type, one of the following:</br>
  nil or `network'</br>
             -- Begin with an ordinary network connection, and if</br>
                the parameters :success and :capability-command</br>
                are also supplied, try to upgrade to an encrypted</br>
                connection via STARTTLS.  Even if that</br>
                fails (e.g. if <u>HOST</u> does not support TLS), retain</br>
                an unencrypted connection.</br>
  `plain'    -- An ordinary, unencrypted network connection.</br>
  `starttls' -- Begin with an ordinary connection, and try</br>
                upgrading via STARTTLS.  If that fails for any</br>
                reason, drop the connection; in that case the</br>
                returned object is a killed process.</br>
  `tls'      -- A TLS connection.</br>
  `ssl'      -- Equivalent to `tls'.</br>
  `shell'    -- A shell connection.</br>
</br>
:return-list specifies this function's return value.</br>
  If omitted or nil, return a process object.  A non-nil means to</br>
  return (PROC . PROPS), where PROC is a process object and PROPS</br>
  is a plist of connection properties, with these keywords:</br>
   :greeting -- the greeting returned by <u>HOST</u> (a string), or nil.</br>
   :capabilities -- a string representing <u>HOST</u>'s capabilities,</br>
                    or nil if none could be found.</br>
   :type -- the resulting connection type; `plain' (unencrypted)</br>
            or `tls' (TLS-encrypted).</br>
</br>
:end-of-command specifies a regexp matching the end of a command.</br>
</br>
:end-of-capability specifies a regexp matching the end of the</br>
  response to the command specified for :capability-command.</br>
  It defaults to the regexp specified for :end-of-command.</br>
</br>
:success specifies a regexp matching a message indicating a</br>
  successful STARTTLS negotiation.  For instance, the default</br>
  should be "^3" for an NNTP connection.</br>
</br>
:capability-command specifies a command used to query the <u>HOST</u></br>
  for its capabilities.  For instance, for IMAP this should be</br>
  "1 CAPABILITY\r\n".</br>
</br>
:starttls-function specifies a function for handling STARTTLS.</br>
  This function should take one parameter, the response to the</br>
  capability command, and should return the command to switch on</br>
  STARTTLS if the server supports STARTTLS, and nil otherwise.</br>
</br>
:always-query-capabilities says whether to query the server for</br>
  capabilities, even if we're doing a `plain' network connection.</br>
</br>
:client-certificate should either be a list where the first</br>
  element is the certificate key file name, and the second</br>
  element is the certificate file name itself, or `t', which</br>
  means that `auth-source' will be queried for the key and the</br>
  certificate.  This parameter will only be used when doing TLS</br>
  or STARTTLS connections.</br>
</br>
:use-starttls-if-possible is a boolean that says to do opportunistic</br>
STARTTLS upgrades even if Emacs doesn't have built-in TLS functionality.</br>
</br>
:nogreeting is a boolean that can be used to inhibit waiting for</br>
a greeting from the server.</br>
</br>
:nowait is a boolean that says the connection should be made</br>
  asynchronously, if possible.
