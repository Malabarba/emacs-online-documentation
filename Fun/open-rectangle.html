<strong>open-rectangle</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>rect.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x r o.<br/>
<br/>
(open-rectangle START END &optional FILL)<br/>
<br/>
Blank out the region-rectangle, shifting text right.<br/>
<br/>
The text previously in the region is not overwritten by the blanks,<br/>
but instead winds up to the right of the rectangle.<br/>
<br/>
When called from a program the rectangle's corners are START and END.<br/>
With a prefix (or a FILL) argument, fill with blanks even if there is<br/>
no text on the right side of the rectangle.
