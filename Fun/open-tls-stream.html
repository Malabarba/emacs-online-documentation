<br/>
(open-tls-stream NAME BUFFER HOST PORT)<br/>
<br/>
Open a TLS connection for a port to a host.<br/>
Returns a subprocess-object to represent the connection.<br/>
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.<br/>
Args are NAME BUFFER HOST PORT.<br/>
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.<br/>
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer name) to associate with the process.<br/>
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify<br/>
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.<br/>
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated<br/>
 with any buffer<br/>
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.<br/>
Fourth arg PORT is an integer specifying a port to connect to.
