org-agenda-write is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org-agenda.el'.<br/><br/>(org-agenda-write FILE &optional OPEN NOSETTINGS AGENDA-BUFNAME)<br/><br/>Write the current buffer (an agenda view) as a file.<br/>Depending on the extension of the file name, plain text (.txt),<br/>HTML (.html or .htm) or Postscript (.ps) is produced.<br/>If the extension is .ics, run icalendar export over all files used<br/>to construct the agenda and limit the export to entries listed in the<br/>agenda now.<br/>With prefix argument OPEN, open the new file immediately.<br/>If NOSETTINGS is given, do not scope the settings of<br/>`org-agenda-exporter-settings' into the export commands.  This is used when<br/>the settings have already been scoped and we do not wish to overrule other,<br/>higher priority settings.<br/>If AGENDA-BUFFER-NAME, use this as the buffer name for the agenda to write.
