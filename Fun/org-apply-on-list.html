<strong>org-apply-on-list</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-list.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-apply-on-list FUNCTION INIT-VALUE &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Call FUNCTION on each item of the list at point.<br/>
FUNCTION must be called with at least one argument: INIT-VALUE,<br/>
that will contain the value returned by the function at the<br/>
previous item, plus ARGS extra arguments.<br/>
<br/>
FUNCTION is applied on items in reverse order.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, (org-apply-on-list (lambda (result) (1+ result)) 0)<br/>
will return the number of items in the current list.<br/>
<br/>
Sublists of the list are skipped.  Cursor is always at the<br/>
beginning of the item.
