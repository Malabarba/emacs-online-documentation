<strong>org-archive-subtree</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-archive.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-archive-subtree &optional <u>FIND-DONE</u>)</br>
</br>
Move the current subtree to the archive.</br>
The archive can be a certain top-level heading in the current file, or in</br>
a different file.  The tree will be moved to that location, the subtree</br>
heading be marked DONE, and the current time will be added.</br>
</br>
When called with prefix argument <u>FIND-DONE</u>, find whole trees without any</br>
open TODO items and archive them (after getting confirmation from the user).</br>
If the cursor is not at a headline when this command is called, try all level</br>
1 trees.  If the cursor is on a headline, only try the direct children of</br>
this heading.
