</br>
Evaluate <u>BODY</u> in BUFFER and return process output.</br>
Will wait until EOE-INDICATOR appears in the output, then return</br>
all process output.  If REMOVE-ECHO and FULL-BODY are present and</br>
non-nil, then strip echo'd body from the returned output.  <u>META</u></br>
should be a list containing the following where the last two</br>
elements are optional.</br>

or user `keyboard-quit' during execution of body.
