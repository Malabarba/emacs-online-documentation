Will wait until EOE-INDICATOR appears in the output, then return<br/>
all process output.  If REMOVE-ECHO and FULL-BODY are present and<br/>
non-nil, then strip echo'd body from the returned output.  META<br/>
should be a list containing the following where the last two<br/>
elements are optional.<br/>

or user `keyboard-quit' during execution of body.
