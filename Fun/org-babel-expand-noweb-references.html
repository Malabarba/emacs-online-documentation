<strong>org-babel-expand-noweb-references</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ob.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-babel-expand-noweb-references &optional INFO PARENT-BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Expand Noweb references in the body of the current source code block.<br/>
<br/>
For example the following reference would be replaced with the<br/>
body of the source-code block named 'example-block'.<br/>
<br/>
<<example-block>><br/>
<br/>
Note that any text preceding the <<foo>> construct on a line will<br/>
be interposed between the lines of the replacement text.  So for<br/>
example if <<foo>> is placed behind a comment, then the entire<br/>
replacement text will also be commented.<br/>
<br/>
This function must be called from inside of the buffer containing<br/>
the source-code block which holds BODY.<br/>
<br/>
In addition the following syntax can be used to insert the<br/>
results of evaluating the source-code block named 'example-block'.<br/>
<br/>
<<example-block()>><br/>
<br/>
Any optional arguments can be passed to example-block by placing<br/>
the arguments inside the parenthesis following the convention<br/>
defined by `org-babel-lob'.  For example<br/>
<br/>
<<example-block(a=9)>><br/>
<br/>
would set the value of argument "a" equal to "9".  Note that<br/>
these arguments are not evaluated in the current source-code<br/>
block but are passed literally to the "example-block".
