org-babel-insert-result is a compiled Lisp function in `ob.el'.<br/><br/>(org-babel-insert-result RESULT &optional RESULT-PARAMS INFO HASH INDENT LANG)<br/><br/>Insert RESULT into the current buffer.<br/>By default RESULT is inserted after the end of the<br/>current source block.  With optional argument RESULT-PARAMS<br/>controls insertion of results in the org-mode file.<br/>RESULT-PARAMS can take the following values:<br/><br/>replace - (default option) insert results after the source block<br/>          replacing any previously inserted results<br/><br/>silent -- no results are inserted<br/><br/>file ---- the results are interpreted as a file path, and are<br/>          inserted into the buffer using the Org-mode file syntax<br/><br/>list ---- the results are interpreted as an Org-mode list.<br/><br/>raw ----- results are added directly to the Org-mode file.  This<br/>          is a good option if you code block will output org-mode<br/>          formatted text.<br/><br/>drawer -- results are added directly to the Org-mode file as with<br/>          "raw", but are wrapped in a RESULTS drawer, allowing<br/>          them to later be replaced or removed automatically.<br/><br/>org ----- results are added inside of a "#+BEGIN_SRC org" block.<br/>          They are not comma-escaped when inserted, but Org syntax<br/>          here will be discarded when exporting the file.<br/><br/>html ---- results are added inside of a #+BEGIN_HTML block.  This<br/>          is a good option if you code block will output html<br/>          formatted text.<br/><br/>latex --- results are added inside of a #+BEGIN_LATEX block.<br/>          This is a good option if you code block will output<br/>          latex formatted text.<br/><br/>code ---- the results are extracted in the syntax of the source<br/>          code of the language being evaluated and are added<br/>          inside of a #+BEGIN_SRC block with the source-code<br/>          language set appropriately.  Note this relies on the<br/>          optional LANG argument.
