<strong>org-babel-process-file-name</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ob-core.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-babel-process-file-name <u>NAME</u> &optional <u>NO-QUOTE-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Prepare <u>NAME</u> to be used in an external process.</br>
If <u>NAME</u> specifies a remote location, the remote portion of the</br>
name is removed, since in that case the process will be executing</br>
remotely.  The file name is then processed by `expand-file-name'.</br>
Unless second argument <u>NO-QUOTE-P</u> is non-nil, the file name is</br>
additionally processed by `shell-quote-argument'
