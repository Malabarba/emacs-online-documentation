<strong>org-babel-process-file-name</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ob.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-babel-process-file-name NAME &optional NO-QUOTE-P)<br/>
<br/>
Prepare NAME to be used in an external process.<br/>
If NAME specifies a remote location, the remote portion of the<br/>
name is removed, since in that case the process will be executing<br/>
remotely.  The file name is then processed by `expand-file-name'.<br/>
Unless second argument NO-QUOTE-P is non-nil, the file name is<br/>
additionally processed by `shell-quote-argument'
