org-babel-ref-index-list is a compiled Lisp function in `ob-ref.el'.<br/><br/>(org-babel-ref-index-list INDEX LIS)<br/><br/>Return the subset of LIS indexed by INDEX.<br/><br/>Indices are 0 based and negative indices count from the end of<br/>LIS, so 0 references the first element of LIS and -1 references<br/>the last.  If INDEX is separated by ","s then each "portion"<br/>is assumed to index into the next deepest nesting or dimension.<br/><br/>A valid "portion" can consist of either an integer index, two<br/>integers separated by a ":" in which case the entire range is<br/>returned, or an empty string or "*" both of which are<br/>interpreted to mean the entire range and as such are equivalent<br/>to "0:-1".
