<strong>org-babel-ref-index-list</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ob-ref.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-babel-ref-index-list <u>INDEX</u> <u>LIS</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the subset of <u>LIS</u> indexed by <u>INDEX</u>.</br>
</br>
Indices are 0 based and negative indices count from the end of</br>
<u>LIS</u>, so 0 references the first element of <u>LIS</u> and -1 references</br>
the last.  If <u>INDEX</u> is separated by ","s then each "portion"</br>
is assumed to index into the next deepest nesting or dimension.</br>
</br>
A valid "portion" can consist of either an integer index, two</br>
integers separated by a ":" in which case the entire range is</br>
returned, or an empty string or "*" both of which are</br>
interpreted to mean the entire range and as such are equivalent</br>
to "0:-1".
