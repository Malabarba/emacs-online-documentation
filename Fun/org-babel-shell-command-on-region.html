<strong>org-babel-shell-command-on-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>ob-eval.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-babel-shell-command-on-region START END COMMAND &optional OUTPUT-BUFFER REPLACE ERROR-BUFFER DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Execute COMMAND in an inferior shell with region as input.<br/>
<br/>
Fixes bugs in the emacs 23.1.1 version of `shell-command-on-region'<br/>
<br/>
Normally display output (if any) in temp buffer `*Shell Command Output*';<br/>
Prefix arg means replace the region with it.  Return the exit code of<br/>
COMMAND.<br/>
<br/>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters in<br/>
the input and output to the shell command, use<br/>
C-x RET c before this command.  By<br/>
default, the input (from the current buffer) is encoded in the<br/>
same coding system that will be used to save the file,<br/>
`buffer-file-coding-system'.  If the output is going to replace<br/>
the region, then it is decoded from that same coding system.<br/>
<br/>
The noninteractive arguments are START, END, COMMAND,<br/>
OUTPUT-BUFFER, REPLACE, ERROR-BUFFER, and DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER.<br/>
Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding<br/>
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.<br/>
<br/>
If the command generates output, the output may be displayed<br/>
in the echo area or in a buffer.<br/>
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area<br/>
(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if<br/>
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.  Otherwise<br/>
it is displayed in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.  The output<br/>
is available in that buffer in both cases.<br/>
<br/>
If there is output and an error, a message about the error<br/>
appears at the end of the output.<br/>
<br/>
If there is no output, or if output is inserted in the current buffer,<br/>
then `*Shell Command Output*' is deleted.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional fourth argument OUTPUT-BUFFER is non-nil,<br/>
that says to put the output in some other buffer.<br/>
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, put the output there.<br/>
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil,<br/>
insert output in the current buffer.<br/>
In either case, the output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).<br/>
<br/>
If REPLACE, the optional fifth argument, is non-nil, that means insert<br/>
the output in place of text from START to END, putting point and mark<br/>
around it.<br/>
<br/>
If optional sixth argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer<br/>
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.<br/>
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.<br/>
If DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, display the error buffer if there<br/>
were any errors.  (This is always t, interactively.)<br/>
In an interactive call, the variable `shell-command-default-error-buffer'<br/>
specifies the value of ERROR-BUFFER.
