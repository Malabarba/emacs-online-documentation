<strong>org-beamer-select-environment</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>ox-beamer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-beamer-select-environment)</br>
</br>
Select the environment to be used by beamer for this entry.</br>
While this uses (for convenience) a tag selection interface, the</br>
result of this command will be that the BEAMER_env *property* of</br>
the entry is set.</br>
</br>
In addition to this, the command will also set a tag as a visual</br>
aid, but the tag does not have any semantic meaning.
