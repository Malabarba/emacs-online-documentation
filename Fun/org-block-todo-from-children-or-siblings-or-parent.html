(org-block-todo-from-children-or-siblings-or-parent <u>CHANGE-PLIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Block turning an entry into a TODO, using the hierarchy.</br>
This checks whether the current task should be blocked from state</br>
changes.  Such blocking occurs when:</br>
</br>
  1. The task has children which are not all in a completed state.</br>
</br>
  2. A task has a parent with the property :ORDERED:, and there</br>
     are siblings prior to the current task with incomplete</br>
     status.</br>
</br>
  3. The parent of the task is blocked because it has siblings that should</br>
     be done first, or is child of a block grandparent TODO entry.
