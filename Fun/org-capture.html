org-capture is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-capture.el'.<br/><br/>(org-capture &optional GOTO KEYS)<br/><br/>Capture something.<br/><br/>This will let you select a template from `org-capture-templates', and then<br/>file the newly captured information.  The text is immediately inserted<br/>at the target location, and an indirect buffer is shown where you can<br/>edit it.  Pressing C-c C-c brings you back to the previous state<br/>of Emacs, so that you can continue your work.<br/><br/>When called interactively with a C-u prefix argument GOTO, don't capture<br/>anything, just go to the file/headline where the selected template<br/>stores its notes.  With a double prefix argument C-u C-u, go to the last note<br/>stored.<br/><br/>When called with a `C-0' (zero) prefix, insert a template at point.<br/><br/>Lisp programs can set KEYS to a string associated with a template<br/>in `org-capture-templates'.  In this case, interactive selection<br/>will be bypassed.<br/><br/>If `org-capture-use-agenda-date' is non-nil, capturing from the<br/>agenda will use the date at point as the default date.
