<strong>org-clock-in</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-clock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-clock-in &optional SELECT START-TIME)<br/>
<br/>
Start the clock on the current item.<br/>
If necessary, clock-out of the currently active clock.<br/>
With a prefix argument SELECT (C-u), offer a list of recently clocked<br/>
tasks to clock into.  When SELECT is C-u C-u, clock into the current task<br/>
and mark it as the default task, a special task that will always be offered<br/>
in the clocking selection, associated with the letter `d'.<br/>
When SELECT is C-u C-u C-u, clock in by using the last clock-out<br/>
time as the start time (see `org-clock-continuously' to<br/>
make this the default behavior.)
