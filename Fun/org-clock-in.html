org-clock-in is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-clock.el'.<br/><br/>(org-clock-in &optional SELECT START-TIME)<br/><br/>Start the clock on the current item.<br/>If necessary, clock-out of the currently active clock.<br/>With a prefix argument SELECT (C-u), offer a list of recently clocked<br/>tasks to clock into.  When SELECT is C-u C-u, clock into the current task<br/>and mark it as the default task, a special task that will always be offered<br/>in the clocking selection, associated with the letter `d'.<br/>When SELECT is C-u C-u C-u, clock in by using the last clock-out<br/>time as the start time (see `org-clock-continuously' to<br/>make this the default behavior.)
