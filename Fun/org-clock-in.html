<strong>org-clock-in</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-clock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-clock-in &optional <u>SELECT</u> <u>START-TIME</u>)</br>
</br>
Start the clock on the current item.</br>
If necessary, clock-out of the currently active clock.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>SELECT</u> (C-u), offer a list of recently clocked</br>
tasks to clock into.  When <u>SELECT</u> is C-u C-u, clock into the current task</br>
and mark it as the default task, a special task that will always be offered</br>
in the clocking selection, associated with the letter `d'.</br>
When <u>SELECT</u> is C-u C-u C-u, clock in by using the last clock-out</br>
time as the start time (see `org-clock-continuously' to</br>
make this the default behavior.)
