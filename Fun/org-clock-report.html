Create a table containing a report about clocked time.</br>
If the cursor is inside an existing clocktable block, then the table</br>
will be updated.  If not, a new clocktable will be inserted.  The scope</br>
of the new clock will be subtree when called from within a subtree, and</br>
file elsewhere.</br>

When called with a prefix argument, move to the first clock table in the</br>
buffer and update it.
