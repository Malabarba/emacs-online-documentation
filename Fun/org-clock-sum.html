<strong>org-clock-sum</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-clock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-clock-sum &optional TSTART TEND HEADLINE-FILTER PROPNAME)<br/>
<br/>
Sum the times for each subtree.<br/>
Puts the resulting times in minutes as a text property on each headline.<br/>
TSTART and TEND can mark a time range to be considered.<br/>
HEADLINE-FILTER is a zero-arg function that, if specified, is called for<br/>
each headline in the time range with point at the headline.  Headlines for<br/>
which HEADLINE-FILTER returns nil are excluded from the clock summation.<br/>
PROPNAME lets you set a custom text property instead of :org-clock-minutes.
