</br>
</br>
(org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift <u>N</u> &optional <u>SHIFT</u>)</br>
</br>
Clone the task (subtree) at point <u>N</u> times.</br>
The clones will be inserted as siblings.</br>
</br>
In interactive use, the user will be prompted for the number of</br>
clones to be produced.  If the entry has a timestamp, the user</br>
will also be prompted for a time shift, which may be a repeater</br>
as used in time stamps, for example `+3d'.  To disable this,</br>
you can call the function with a universal prefix argument.</br>
</br>
When a valid repeater is given and the entry contains any time</br>
stamps, the clones will become a sequence in time, with time</br>
stamps in the subtree shifted for each clone produced.  If <u>SHIFT</u></br>
is nil or the empty string, time stamps will be left alone.  The</br>
ID property of the original subtree is removed.</br>
</br>
If the original subtree did contain time stamps with a repeater,</br>
the following will happen:</br>
- the repeater will be removed in each clone</br>
- an additional clone will be produced, with the current, unshifted</br>
  date(s) in the entry.</br>
- the original entry will be placed *after* all the clones, with</br>
  repeater intact.</br>
- the start days in the repeater in the original entry will be shifted</br>
  to past the last clone.</br>
In this way you can spell out a number of instances of a repeating task,</br>
and still retain the repeater to cover future instances of the task.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
