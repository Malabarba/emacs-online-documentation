<strong>org-compatible-face</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-compat.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-compatible-face INHERITS SPECS)<br/>
<br/>
Make a compatible face specification.<br/>
If INHERITS is an existing face and if the Emacs version supports it,<br/>
just inherit the face.  If INHERITS is set and the Emacs version does<br/>
not support it, copy the face specification from the inheritance face.<br/>
If INHERITS is not given and SPECS is, use SPECS to define the face.<br/>
XEmacs and Emacs 21 do not know about the `min-colors' attribute.<br/>
For them we convert a (min-colors 8) entry to a `tty' entry and move it<br/>
to the top of the list.  The `min-colors' attribute will be removed from<br/>
any other entries, and any resulting duplicates will be removed entirely.
