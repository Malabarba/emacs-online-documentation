</br>
</br>

</br>
Convert an org-mode file with only odd levels to one with odd/even levels.</br>
This promotes level 3 to level 2, level 5 to level 3 etc.  If the</br>
file contains a section with an even level, conversion would</br>
destroy the structure of the file.  An error is signaled in this</br>
case.
