org-copy-subtree is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-copy-subtree &optional N CUT FORCE-STORE-MARKERS)<br/><br/>Cut the current subtree into the clipboard.<br/>With prefix arg N, cut this many sequential subtrees.<br/>This is a short-hand for marking the subtree and then copying it.<br/>If CUT is non-nil, actually cut the subtree.<br/>If FORCE-STORE-MARKERS is non-nil, store the relative locations<br/>of some markers in the region, even if CUT is non-nil.  This is<br/>useful if the caller implements cut-and-paste as copy-then-paste-then-cut.
