org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Set tags in headline, or update according to changed information at point.<br/><br/>This command does many different things, depending on context:<br/><br/>- If a function in `org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook' recognizes this location,<br/>  this is what we do.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is in a headline, prompt for tags and insert them<br/>  into the current line, aligned to `org-tags-column'.  When called<br/>  with prefix arg, realign all tags in the current buffer.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is in one of the special #+KEYWORD lines, this<br/>  triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the<br/>  information.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command<br/>  works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is on a #+TBLFM line, re-apply the formulas to<br/>  the entire table.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is at a footnote reference or definition, jump to<br/>  the corresponding definition or references, respectively.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is a the beginning of a dynamic block, update it.<br/><br/>- If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close note and file it.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is on a <<<target>>>, update radio targets and<br/>  corresponding links in this buffer.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the<br/>  ordered list.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is on a checkbox, toggle it.<br/><br/>- If the cursor is on a code block, evaluate it.  The variable<br/>  `org-confirm-babel-evaluate' can be used to control prompting<br/>  before code block evaluation, by default every code block<br/>  evaluation requires confirmation.  Code block evaluation can be<br/>  inhibited by setting `org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c'.
