<strong>org-edit-fixed-width-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-src.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-edit-fixed-width-region)</br>
</br>
Edit the fixed-width ascii drawing at point.</br>
This must be a region where each line starts with a colon followed by</br>
a space character.</br>
An new buffer is created and the fixed-width region is copied into it,</br>
and the buffer is switched into `artist-mode' for editing.  When done,</br>
exit with M-x org-edit-src-exit.  The edited text will then replace</br>
the fragment in the Org-mode buffer.
