<strong>org-edit-src-code</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-src.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-edit-src-code &optional CONTEXT CODE EDIT-BUFFER-NAME)<br/>
<br/>
Edit the source CODE block at point.<br/>
The code is copied to a separate buffer and the appropriate mode<br/>
is turned on.  When done, exit with M-x org-edit-src-exit.  This will<br/>
remove the original code in the Org buffer, and replace it with the<br/>
edited version.  An optional argument CONTEXT is used by M-x org-edit-src-save<br/>
when calling this function.  See `org-src-window-setup' to configure<br/>
the display of windows containing the Org buffer and the code buffer.
