<strong>org-entry-properties</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-entry-properties &optional <u>POM</u> <u>WHICH</u> <u>SPECIFIC</u>)</br>
</br>
Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker <u>POM</u>.</br>
This includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for deadline,</br>
scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties defined in the</br>
entry.  The return value is an alist, keys may occur multiple times</br>
if the property key was used several times.</br>
<u>POM</u> may also be nil, in which case the current entry is used.</br>
If <u>WHICH</u> is nil or `all', get all properties.  If <u>WHICH</u> is</br>
`special' or `standard', only get that subclass.  If <u>WHICH</u></br>
is a string only get exactly this property.  <u>SPECIFIC</u> can be a string, the</br>
specific property we are interested in.  Specifying it can speed</br>
things up because then unnecessary parsing is avoided.
