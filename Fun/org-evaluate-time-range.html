<strong>org-evaluate-time-range</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-evaluate-time-range &optional <u>TO-BUFFER</u>)</br>
</br>
Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start and end.</br>
Normally the result is just printed in the echo area, but with prefix arg</br>
<u>TO-BUFFER</u>, the result is inserted just after the date stamp into the buffer.</br>
If the time range is actually in a table, the result is inserted into the</br>
next column.</br>
For time difference computation, a year is assumed to be exactly 365</br>
days in order to avoid rounding problems.
