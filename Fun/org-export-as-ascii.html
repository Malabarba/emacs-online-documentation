org-export-as-ascii is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-ascii.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export-as-ascii ARG &optional EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/><br/>Export the outline as a pretty ASCII file.<br/>If there is an active region, export only the region.<br/>The prefix ARG specifies how many levels of the outline should become<br/>underlined headlines, default is 3.    Lower levels will become bulleted<br/>lists.  EXT-PLIST is a property list with external parameters overriding<br/>org-mode's default settings, but still inferior to file-local<br/>settings.  When TO-BUFFER is non-nil, create a buffer with that<br/>name and export to that buffer.  If TO-BUFFER is the symbol<br/>`string', don't leave any buffer behind but just return the<br/>resulting ASCII as a string.  When BODY-ONLY is set, don't produce<br/>the file header and footer.  When PUB-DIR is set, use this as the<br/>publishing directory.
