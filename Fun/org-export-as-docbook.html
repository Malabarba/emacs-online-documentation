<strong>org-export-as-docbook</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-docbook.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-export-as-docbook &optional EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/>
<br/>
Export the current buffer as a DocBook file.<br/>
If there is an active region, export only the region.  When<br/>
HIDDEN is obsolete and does nothing.  EXT-PLIST is a<br/>
property list with external parameters overriding org-mode's<br/>
default settings, but still inferior to file-local settings.<br/>
When TO-BUFFER is non-nil, create a buffer with that name and<br/>
export to that buffer.  If TO-BUFFER is the symbol `string',<br/>
don't leave any buffer behind but just return the resulting HTML<br/>
as a string.  When BODY-ONLY is set, don't produce the file<br/>
header and footer, simply return the content of the document (all<br/>
top-level sections).  When PUB-DIR is set, use this as the<br/>
publishing directory.
