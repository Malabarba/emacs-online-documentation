org-export-as-docbook is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-docbook.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export-as-docbook &optional EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/><br/>Export the current buffer as a DocBook file.<br/>If there is an active region, export only the region.  When<br/>HIDDEN is obsolete and does nothing.  EXT-PLIST is a<br/>property list with external parameters overriding org-mode's<br/>default settings, but still inferior to file-local settings.<br/>When TO-BUFFER is non-nil, create a buffer with that name and<br/>export to that buffer.  If TO-BUFFER is the symbol `string',<br/>don't leave any buffer behind but just return the resulting HTML<br/>as a string.  When BODY-ONLY is set, don't produce the file<br/>header and footer, simply return the content of the document (all<br/>top-level sections).  When PUB-DIR is set, use this as the<br/>publishing directory.
