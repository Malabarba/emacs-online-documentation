org-export-as-freemind is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-freemind.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export-as-freemind &optional HIDDEN EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/><br/>Export the current buffer as a Freemind file.<br/>If there is an active region, export only the region.  HIDDEN is<br/>obsolete and does nothing.  EXT-PLIST is a property list with<br/>external parameters overriding org-mode's default settings, but<br/>still inferior to file-local settings.  When TO-BUFFER is<br/>non-nil, create a buffer with that name and export to that<br/>buffer.  If TO-BUFFER is the symbol `string', don't leave any<br/>buffer behind but just return the resulting HTML as a string.<br/>When BODY-ONLY is set, don't produce the file header and footer,<br/>simply return the content of the document (all top level<br/>sections).  When PUB-DIR is set, use this as the publishing<br/>directory.<br/><br/>See `org-freemind-from-org-mode' for more information.
