org-export-as-html is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-html.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export-as-html ARG &optional EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/><br/>Export the outline as a pretty HTML file.<br/>If there is an active region, export only the region.  The prefix<br/>ARG specifies how many levels of the outline should become<br/>headlines.  The default is 3.  Lower levels will become bulleted<br/>lists.  EXT-PLIST is a property list with external parameters overriding<br/>org-mode's default settings, but still inferior to file-local<br/>settings.  When TO-BUFFER is non-nil, create a buffer with that<br/>name and export to that buffer.  If TO-BUFFER is the symbol<br/>`string', don't leave any buffer behind but just return the<br/>resulting HTML as a string.  When BODY-ONLY is set, don't produce<br/>the file header and footer, simply return the content of<br/><body>...</body>, without even the body tags themselves.  When<br/>PUB-DIR is set, use this as the publishing directory.
