<strong>org-export-as-latex</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-latex.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-export-as-latex ARG &optional EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/>
<br/>
Export current buffer to a LaTeX file.<br/>
If there is an active region, export only the region.  The prefix<br/>
ARG specifies how many levels of the outline should become<br/>
headlines.  The default is 3.  Lower levels will be exported<br/>
depending on `org-export-latex-low-levels'.  The default is to<br/>
convert them as description lists.<br/>
EXT-PLIST is a property list with external parameters overriding<br/>
org-mode's default settings, but still inferior to file-local settings.<br/>
When TO-BUFFER is non-nil, create a buffer with that name and export<br/>
to that buffer.  If TO-BUFFER is the symbol `string', don't leave any<br/>
buffer behind and just return the resulting LaTeX as a string, with<br/>
no LaTeX header.<br/>
When BODY-ONLY is set, don't produce the file header and footer,<br/>
simply return the content of \begin{document}...\end{document},<br/>
without even the \begin{document} and \end{document} commands.<br/>
When PUB-DIR is set, use this as the publishing directory.
