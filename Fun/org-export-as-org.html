<strong>org-export-as-org</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-exp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-export-as-org ARG &optional EXT-PLIST TO-BUFFER BODY-ONLY PUB-DIR)<br/>
<br/>
Make a copy with not-exporting stuff removed.<br/>
The purpose of this function is to provide a way to export the source<br/>
Org file of a webpage in Org format, but with sensitive and/or irrelevant<br/>
stuff removed.  This command will remove the following:<br/>
<br/>
- archived trees (if the variable `org-export-with-archived-trees' is nil)<br/>
- comment blocks and trees starting with the COMMENT keyword<br/>
- only trees that are consistent with `org-export-select-tags'<br/>
  and `org-export-exclude-tags'.<br/>
<br/>
The only arguments that will be used are EXT-PLIST and PUB-DIR,<br/>
all the others will be ignored (but are present so that the general<br/>
mechanism to call publishing functions will work).<br/>
<br/>
EXT-PLIST is a property list with external parameters overriding<br/>
org-mode's default settings, but still inferior to file-local<br/>
settings.  When PUB-DIR is set, use this as the publishing<br/>
directory.
