<strong>org-export-as-taskjuggler</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-taskjuggler.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-export-as-taskjuggler)<br/>
<br/>
Export parts of the current buffer as a TaskJuggler file.<br/>
The exporter looks for a tree with tag, property or todo that<br/>
matches `org-export-taskjuggler-project-tag' and takes this as<br/>
the tasks for this project.  The first node of this tree defines<br/>
the project properties such as project name and project period.<br/>
If there is a tree with tag, property or todo that matches<br/>
`org-export-taskjuggler-resource-tag' this three is taken as<br/>
resources for the project.  If no resources are specified, a<br/>
default resource is created and allocated to the project.  Also<br/>
the taskjuggler project will be created with default reports as<br/>
defined in `org-export-taskjuggler-default-reports'.
