<strong>org-export-dispatch</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>ox.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-export-dispatch &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Export dispatcher for Org mode.</br>
</br>
It provides an access to common export related tasks in a buffer.</br>
Its interface comes in two flavors: standard and expert.</br>
</br>
While both share the same set of bindings, only the former</br>
displays the valid keys associations in a dedicated buffer.</br>
Scrolling (resp. line-wise motion) in this buffer is done with</br>
SPC and DEL (resp. C-n and C-p) keys.</br>
</br>
Set variable `org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui' to switch to one</br>
flavor or the other.</br>
</br>
When <u>ARG</u> is C-u, repeat the last export action, with the same set</br>
of options used back then, on the current buffer.</br>
</br>
When <u>ARG</u> is C-u C-u, display the asynchronous export stack.
