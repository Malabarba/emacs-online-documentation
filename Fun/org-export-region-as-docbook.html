org-export-region-as-docbook is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-docbook.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export-region-as-docbook BEG END &optional BODY-ONLY BUFFER)<br/><br/>Convert region from BEG to END in `org-mode' buffer to DocBook.<br/>If prefix arg BODY-ONLY is set, omit file header and footer and<br/>only produce the region of converted text, useful for<br/>cut-and-paste operations.  If BUFFER is a buffer or a string,<br/>use/create that buffer as a target of the converted DocBook.  If<br/>BUFFER is the symbol `string', return the produced DocBook as a<br/>string and leave not buffer behind.  For example, a Lisp program<br/>could call this function in the following way:<br/><br/>  (setq docbook (org-export-region-as-docbook beg end t 'string))<br/><br/>When called interactively, the output buffer is selected, and shown<br/>in a window.  A non-interactive call will only return the buffer.
