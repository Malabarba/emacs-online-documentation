org-export-region-as-latex is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-latex.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export-region-as-latex BEG END &optional BODY-ONLY BUFFER)<br/><br/>Convert region from BEG to END in `org-mode' buffer to LaTeX.<br/>If prefix arg BODY-ONLY is set, omit file header, footer, and table of<br/>contents, and only produce the region of converted text, useful for<br/>cut-and-paste operations.<br/>If BUFFER is a buffer or a string, use/create that buffer as a target<br/>of the converted LaTeX.  If BUFFER is the symbol `string', return the<br/>produced LaTeX as a string and leave no buffer behind.  For example,<br/>a Lisp program could call this function in the following way:<br/><br/>  (setq latex (org-export-region-as-latex beg end t 'string))<br/><br/>When called interactively, the output buffer is selected, and shown<br/>in a window.  A non-interactive call will only return the buffer.
