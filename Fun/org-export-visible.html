<strong>org-export-visible</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-exp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-export-visible TYPE ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Create a copy of the visible part of the current buffer, and export it.<br/>
The copy is created in a temporary buffer and removed after use.<br/>
TYPE is the final key (as a string) that also selects the export command in<br/>
the C-c C-e export dispatcher.<br/>
As a special case, if the you type SPC at the prompt, the temporary<br/>
org-mode file will not be removed but presented to you so that you can<br/>
continue to use it.  The prefix arg ARG is passed through to the exporting<br/>
command.
