org-export is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `org-exp.el'.<br/><br/>(org-export &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Export dispatcher for Org-mode.<br/>When `org-export-run-in-background' is non-nil, try to run the command<br/>in the background.  This will be done only for commands that write<br/>to a file.  For details see the docstring of `org-export-run-in-background'.<br/><br/>The prefix argument ARG will be passed to the exporter.  However, if<br/>ARG is a double universal prefix C-u C-u, that means to inverse the<br/>value of `org-export-run-in-background'.<br/><br/>If `org-export-initial-scope' is set to 'subtree, try to export<br/>the current subtree, otherwise try to export the whole buffer.<br/>Pressing `1' will switch between these two options.
