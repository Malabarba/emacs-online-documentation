</br>
(org-file-apps-entry-match-against-dlink-p <u>ENTRY</u>)</br>

expression which should be matched against the whole link by</br>
org-open-file.</br>
</br>
It assumes that is the case when the entry uses a regular</br>
expression which has at least one grouping construct and the</br>
action is either a lisp form or a command string containing</br>
'%1', i.e. using at least one subexpression match as a</br>
parameter.
