org-fill-paragraph is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-fill-paragraph &optional JUSTIFY)<br/><br/>Fill element at point, when applicable.<br/><br/>This function only applies to comment blocks, comments, example<br/>blocks and paragraphs.  Also, as a special case, re-align table<br/>when point is at one.<br/><br/>If JUSTIFY is non-nil (interactively, with prefix argument),<br/>justify as well.  If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then<br/>period followed by one space does not end a sentence, so don't<br/>break a line there.  The variable `fill-column' controls the<br/>width for filling.<br/><br/>For convenience, when point is at a plain list, an item or<br/>a footnote definition, try to fill the first paragraph within.
