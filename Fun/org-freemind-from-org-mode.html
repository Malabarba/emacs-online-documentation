org-freemind-from-org-mode is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-freemind.el'.<br/><br/>(org-freemind-from-org-mode ORG-FILE MM-FILE)<br/><br/>Convert the `org-mode' file ORG-FILE to the FreeMind file MM-FILE.<br/>All the nodes will be opened or closed in Freemind just as you<br/>have them in `org-mode'.<br/><br/>Note that exporting to Freemind also gives you an alternative way<br/>to export from `org-mode' to html.  You can create a dynamic html<br/>version of the your org file, by first exporting to Freemind and<br/>then exporting from Freemind to html.  The 'As<br/>XHTML (JavaScript)' version in Freemind works very well (and you<br/>can use a CSS stylesheet to style it).
