<strong>org-freemind-from-org-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-freemind.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-freemind-from-org-mode ORG-FILE MM-FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Convert the `org-mode' file ORG-FILE to the FreeMind file MM-FILE.<br/>
All the nodes will be opened or closed in Freemind just as you<br/>
have them in `org-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
Note that exporting to Freemind also gives you an alternative way<br/>
to export from `org-mode' to html.  You can create a dynamic html<br/>
version of the your org file, by first exporting to Freemind and<br/>
then exporting from Freemind to html.  The 'As<br/>
XHTML (JavaScript)' version in Freemind works very well (and you<br/>
can use a CSS stylesheet to style it).
