</br>
</br>
(org-goto &optional <u>ALTERNATIVE-INTERFACE</u>)</br>
</br>
Look up a different location in the current file, keeping current visibility.</br>
</br>
When you want look-up or go to a different location in a</br>
document, the fastest way is often to fold the entire buffer and</br>
then dive into the tree.  This method has the disadvantage, that</br>
the previous location will be folded, which may not be what you</br>
want.</br>
</br>
This command works around this by showing a copy of the current</br>
buffer in an indirect buffer, in overview mode.  You can dive</br>
into the tree in that copy, use org-occur and incremental search</br>
to find a location.  When pressing RET or `Q', the command</br>
returns to the original buffer in which the visibility is still</br>
unchanged.  After RET it will also jump to the location selected</br>
in the indirect buffer and expose the headline hierarchy above.</br>
</br>
With a prefix argument, use the alternative interface: e.g. if</br>
`org-goto-interface' is 'outline use 'outline-path-completion.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
