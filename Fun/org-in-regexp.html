<strong>org-in-regexp</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-in-regexp RE &optional NLINES VISUALLY)<br/>
<br/>
Check if point is inside a match of regexp.<br/>
Normally only the current line is checked, but you can include NLINES extra<br/>
lines both before and after point into the search.<br/>
If VISUALLY is set, require that the cursor is not after the match but<br/>
really on, so that the block visually is on the match.
