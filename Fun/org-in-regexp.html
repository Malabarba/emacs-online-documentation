<strong>org-in-regexp</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-in-regexp <u>RE</u> &optional <u>NLINES</u> <u>VISUALLY</u>)</br>
</br>
Check if point is inside a match of regexp.</br>
Normally only the current line is checked, but you can include <u>NLINES</u> extra</br>
lines both before and after point into the search.</br>
If <u>VISUALLY</u> is set, require that the cursor is not after the match but</br>
really on, so that the block visually is on the match.
