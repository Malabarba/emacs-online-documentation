org-insert-heading is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-insert-heading &optional FORCE-HEADING INVISIBLE-OK)<br/><br/>Insert a new heading or item with same depth at point.<br/>If point is in a plain list and FORCE-HEADING is nil, create a new list item.<br/>If point is at the beginning of a headline, insert a sibling before the<br/>current headline.  If point is not at the beginning, split the line,<br/>create the new headline with the text in the current line after point<br/>(but see also the variable `org-M-RET-may-split-line').<br/><br/>When INVISIBLE-OK is set, stop at invisible headlines when going back.<br/>This is important for non-interactive uses of the command.
