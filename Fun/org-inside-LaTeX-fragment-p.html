</br>
(org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p)</br>
</br>
Test if point is inside a LaTeX fragment.</br>
I.e. after a \begin, \(, M-x , $, or $$, without the corresponding closing</br>
sequence appearing also before point.</br>
Even though the matchers for math are configurable, this function assumes</br>
that \begin, \(, \[, and $$ are always used.  Only the single dollar</br>
delimiters are skipped when they have been removed by customization.</br>
The return value is nil, or a cons cell with the delimiter and the</br>
position of this delimiter.</br>
</br>
This function does a reasonably good job, but can locally be fooled by</br>
for example currency specifications.  For example it will assume being in</br>
inline math after "$22.34".  The LaTeX fragment formatter will only format</br>
fragments that are properly closed, but during editing, we have to live</br>
with the uncertainty caused by missing closing delimiters.  This function</br>
looks only before point, not after.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
