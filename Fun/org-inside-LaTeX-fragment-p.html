org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p is a compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p)<br/><br/>Test if point is inside a LaTeX fragment.<br/>I.e. after a \begin, \(, M-x , $, or $$, without the corresponding closing<br/>sequence appearing also before point.<br/>Even though the matchers for math are configurable, this function assumes<br/>that \begin, \(, \[, and $$ are always used.  Only the single dollar<br/>delimiters are skipped when they have been removed by customization.<br/>The return value is nil, or a cons cell with the delimiter and the<br/>position of this delimiter.<br/><br/>This function does a reasonably good job, but can locally be fooled by<br/>for example currency specifications.  For example it will assume being in<br/>inline math after "$22.34".  The LaTeX fragment formatter will only format<br/>fragments that are properly closed, but during editing, we have to live<br/>with the uncertainty caused by missing closing delimiters.  This function<br/>looks only before point, not after.
