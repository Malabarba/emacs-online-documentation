<strong>org-kill-is-subtree-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-kill-is-subtree-p &optional <u>TXT</u>)</br>
</br>
Check if the current kill is an outline subtree, or a set of trees.</br>
Returns nil if kill does not start with a headline, or if the first</br>
headline level is not the largest headline level in the tree.</br>
So this will actually accept several entries of equal levels as well,</br>
which is OK for `org-paste-subtree'.</br>
If optional <u>TXT</u> is given, check this string instead of the current kill.
