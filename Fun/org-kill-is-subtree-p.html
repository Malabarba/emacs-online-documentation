org-kill-is-subtree-p is a compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-kill-is-subtree-p &optional TXT)<br/><br/>Check if the current kill is an outline subtree, or a set of trees.<br/>Returns nil if kill does not start with a headline, or if the first<br/>headline level is not the largest headline level in the tree.<br/>So this will actually accept several entries of equal levels as well,<br/>which is OK for `org-paste-subtree'.<br/>If optional TXT is given, check this string instead of the current kill.
