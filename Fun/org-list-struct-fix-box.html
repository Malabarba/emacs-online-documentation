<strong>org-list-struct-fix-box</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-list.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-list-struct-fix-box STRUCT PARENTS PREVS &optional ORDERED)<br/>
<br/>
Verify and correct checkboxes in STRUCT.<br/>
<br/>
PARENTS is the alist of parents and PREVS is the alist of<br/>
previous items, as returned by, respectively,<br/>
`org-list-parents-alist' and `org-list-prevs-alist'.<br/>
<br/>
If ORDERED is non-nil, a checkbox can only be checked when every<br/>
checkbox before it is checked too.  If there was an attempt to<br/>
break this rule, the function will return the blocking item.  In<br/>
all others cases, the return value will be nil.<br/>
<br/>
This function modifies STRUCT.
