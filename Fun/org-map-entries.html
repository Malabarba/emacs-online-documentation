</br>
(org-map-entries <u>FUNC</u> &optional <u>MATCH</u> <u>SCOPE</u> &rest <u>SKIP</u>)</br>
</br>
Call <u>FUNC</u> at each headline selected by <u>MATCH</u> in <u>SCOPE</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>FUNC</u> is a function or a lisp form.  The function will be called without</br>
arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline.</br>
The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and</br>
returned as a list.</br>
</br>
The call to <u>FUNC</u> will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so <u>FUNC</u></br>
does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be</br>
moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the</br>
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some</br>
circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,</br>
if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could</br>
mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you</br>
can specify the position from where search should continue by making</br>
<u>FUNC</u> set the variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer</br>
position.</br>
</br>
<u>MATCH</u> is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda tags view.</br>
Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during</br>
the iteration.  When <u>MATCH</u> is nil or t, all headlines will be</br>
visited by the iteration.</br>
</br>
<u>SCOPE</u> determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:</br>
</br>
nil     The current buffer, respecting the restriction if any</br>
tree    The subtree started with the entry at point</br>
region  The entries within the active region, if any</br>
region-start-level</br>
        The entries within the active region, but only those at</br>
        the same level than the first one.</br>
file    The current buffer, without restriction</br>
file-with-archives</br>
        The current buffer, and any archives associated with it</br>
agenda  All agenda files</br>
agenda-with-archives</br>
        All agenda files with any archive files associated with them</br>
(file1 file2 ...)</br>
        If this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned</br>
</br>
The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of</br>
the scanner.  The following items can be given here:</br>
</br>
  archive    skip trees with the archive tag</br>
  comment    skip trees with the COMMENT keyword</br>
  function or Emacs Lisp form:</br>
             will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function', so</br>
             whenever the function returns a position, <u>FUNC</u> will not be</br>
             called for that entry and search will continue from the</br>
             position returned</br>
</br>
If your function needs to retrieve the tags including inherited tags</br>
at the *current* entry, you can use the value of the variable</br>
`org-scanner-tags' which will be much faster than getting the value</br>
with `org-get-tags-at'.  If your function gets properties with</br>
`org-entry-properties' at the *current* entry, bind `org-trust-scanner-tags'</br>
to t around the call to `org-entry-properties' to get the same speedup.</br>
Note that if your function moves around to retrieve tags and properties at</br>
a *different* entry, you cannot use these techniques.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
