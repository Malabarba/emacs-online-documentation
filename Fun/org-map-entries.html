org-map-entries is a compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-map-entries FUNC &optional MATCH SCOPE &rest SKIP)<br/><br/>Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.<br/><br/>FUNC is a function or a lisp form.  The function will be called without<br/>arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline.<br/>The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and<br/>returned as a list.<br/><br/>The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so FUNC<br/>does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be<br/>moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the<br/>processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some<br/>circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,<br/>if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could<br/>mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you<br/>can specify the position from where search should continue by making<br/>FUNC set the variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer<br/>position.<br/><br/>MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda tags view.<br/>Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during<br/>the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all headlines will be<br/>visited by the iteration.<br/><br/>SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:<br/><br/>nil     The current buffer, respecting the restriction if any<br/>tree    The subtree started with the entry at point<br/>region  The entries within the active region, if any<br/>region-start-level<br/>        The entries within the active region, but only those at<br/>        the same level than the first one.<br/>file    The current buffer, without restriction<br/>file-with-archives<br/>        The current buffer, and any archives associated with it<br/>agenda  All agenda files<br/>agenda-with-archives<br/>        All agenda files with any archive files associated with them<br/>(file1 file2 ...)<br/>        If this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned<br/><br/>The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of<br/>the scanner.  The following items can be given here:<br/><br/>  archive    skip trees with the archive tag<br/>  comment    skip trees with the COMMENT keyword<br/>  function or Emacs Lisp form:<br/>             will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function', so<br/>             whenever the function returns a position, FUNC will not be<br/>             called for that entry and search will continue from the<br/>             position returned<br/><br/>If your function needs to retrieve the tags including inherited tags<br/>at the *current* entry, you can use the value of the variable<br/>`org-scanner-tags' which will be much faster than getting the value<br/>with `org-get-tags-at'.  If your function gets properties with<br/>`org-entry-properties' at the *current* entry, bind `org-trust-scanner-tags'<br/>to t around the call to `org-entry-properties' to get the same speedup.<br/>Note that if your function moves around to retrieve tags and properties at<br/>a *different* entry, you cannot use these techniques.
