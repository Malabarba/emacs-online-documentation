org-maybe-intangible is a Lisp macro in `org-macs.el'.<br/><br/>(org-maybe-intangible PROPS)<br/><br/>Add '(intangible t) to PROPS if Emacs version is earlier than Emacs 22.<br/>In Emacs 21, invisible text is not avoided by the command loop, so the<br/>intangible property is needed to make sure point skips this text.<br/>In Emacs 22, this is not necessary.  The intangible text property has<br/>led to problems with flyspell.  These problems are fixed in flyspell.el,<br/>but we still avoid setting the property in Emacs 22 and later.<br/>We use a macro so that the test can happen at compilation time.
