<strong>org-maybe-intangible</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>org-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-maybe-intangible <u>PROPS</u>)</br>
</br>
Add '(intangible t) to <u>PROPS</u> if Emacs version is earlier than Emacs 22.</br>
In Emacs 21, invisible text is not avoided by the command loop, so the</br>
intangible property is needed to make sure point skips this text.</br>
In Emacs 22, this is not necessary.  The intangible text property has</br>
led to problems with flyspell.  These problems are fixed in flyspell.el,</br>
but we still avoid setting the property in Emacs 22 and later.</br>
We use a macro so that the test can happen at compilation time.
