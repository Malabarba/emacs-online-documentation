org-mks is a compiled Lisp function in `org-mks.el'.<br/><br/>(org-mks TABLE TITLE &optional PROMPT SPECIALS)<br/><br/>Select a member of an alist with multiple keys.<br/>TABLE is the alist which should contain entries where the car is a string.<br/>There should be two types of entries.<br/><br/>1. prefix descriptions like ("a" "Description")<br/>   This indicates that `a' is a prefix key for multi-letter selection, and<br/>   that there are entries following with keys like "ab", "ax"...<br/><br/>2. Selectable members must have more than two elements, with the first<br/>   being the string of keys that lead to selecting it, and the second a<br/>   short description string of the item.<br/><br/>The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries<br/>that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key<br/>prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.<br/>When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)<br/>under this key will be shown and offered for selection.<br/><br/>TITLE will be placed over the selection in the temporary buffer,<br/>PROMPT will be used when prompting for a key.  SPECIAL is an alist with<br/>also ("key" "description") entries.  When one of these is selection,<br/>only the bare key is returned.
