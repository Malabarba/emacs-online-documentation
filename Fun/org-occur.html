<strong>org-occur</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-occur <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>KEEP-PREVIOUS</u> <u>CALLBACK</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a compact tree which shows all matches of <u>REGEXP</u>.</br>
The tree will show the lines where the regexp matches, and all higher</br>
headlines above the match.  It will also show the heading after the match,</br>
to make sure editing the matching entry is easy.</br>
If <u>KEEP-PREVIOUS</u> is non-nil, highlighting and exposing done by a previous</br>
call to `org-occur' will be kept, to allow stacking of calls to this</br>
command.</br>
If <u>CALLBACK</u> is non-nil, it is a function which is called to confirm</br>
that the match should indeed be shown.
