<strong>org-occur</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-occur REGEXP &optional KEEP-PREVIOUS CALLBACK)<br/>
<br/>
Make a compact tree which shows all matches of REGEXP.<br/>
The tree will show the lines where the regexp matches, and all higher<br/>
headlines above the match.  It will also show the heading after the match,<br/>
to make sure editing the matching entry is easy.<br/>
If KEEP-PREVIOUS is non-nil, highlighting and exposing done by a previous<br/>
call to `org-occur' will be kept, to allow stacking of calls to this<br/>
command.<br/>
If CALLBACK is non-nil, it is a function which is called to confirm<br/>
that the match should indeed be shown.
