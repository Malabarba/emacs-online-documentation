<strong>org-open-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-open-file PATH &optional IN-EMACS LINE SEARCH)<br/>
<br/>
Open the file at PATH.<br/>
First, this expands any special file name abbreviations.  Then the<br/>
configuration variable `org-file-apps' is checked if it contains an<br/>
entry for this file type, and if yes, the corresponding command is launched.<br/>
<br/>
If no application is found, Emacs simply visits the file.<br/>
<br/>
With optional prefix argument IN-EMACS, Emacs will visit the file.<br/>
With a double C-u C-u prefix arg, Org tries to avoid opening in Emacs<br/>
and to use an external application to visit the file.<br/>
<br/>
Optional LINE specifies a line to go to, optional SEARCH a string<br/>
to search for.  If LINE or SEARCH is given, the file will be<br/>
opened in Emacs, unless an entry from org-file-apps that makes<br/>
use of groups in a regexp matches.<br/>

If you want to change the way frames are used when following a<br/>
link, please customize `org-link-frame-setup'.<br/>
<br/>
If the file does not exist, an error is thrown.
