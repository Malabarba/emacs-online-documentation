<strong>org-outline-level</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-outline-level)<br/>
<br/>
Compute the outline level of the heading at point.<br/>
This function assumes that the cursor is at the beginning of a line matched<br/>
by `outline-regexp'.  Otherwise it returns garbage.<br/>
If this is called at a normal headline, the level is the number of stars.<br/>
Use `org-reduced-level' to remove the effect of `org-odd-levels'.
