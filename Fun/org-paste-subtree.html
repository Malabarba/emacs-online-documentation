</br>
</br>
(org-paste-subtree &optional <u>LEVEL</u> <u>TREE</u> <u>FOR-YANK</u>)</br>
</br>
Paste the clipboard as a subtree, with modification of headline level.</br>
The entire subtree is promoted or demoted in order to match a new headline</br>
level.</br>
</br>
If the cursor is at the beginning of a headline, the same level as</br>
that headline is used to paste the tree.</br>
</br>
If not, the new level is derived from the *visible* headings</br>
before and after the insertion point, and taken to be the inferior headline</br>
level of the two.  So if the previous visible heading is level 3 and the</br>
next is level 4 (or vice versa), level 4 will be used for insertion.</br>
This makes sure that the subtree remains an independent subtree and does</br>
not swallow low level entries.</br>
</br>
You can also force a different level, either by using a numeric prefix</br>
argument, or by inserting the heading marker by hand.  For example, if the</br>
cursor is after "*****", then the tree will be shifted to level 5.</br>
</br>
If optional <u>TREE</u> is given, use this text instead of the kill ring.</br>
</br>
When <u>FOR-YANK</u> is set, this is called by `org-yank'.  In this case, do not</br>
move back over whitespace before inserting, and move point to the end of</br>
the inserted text when done.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
