</br>
(org-read-date &optional <u>ORG-WITH-TIME</u> <u>TO-TIME</u> <u>FROM-STRING</u> <u>PROMPT</u> <u>DEFAULT-TIME</u> <u>DEFAULT-INPUT</u> <u>INACTIVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Read a date, possibly a time, and make things smooth for the user.</br>
The prompt will suggest to enter an ISO date, but you can also enter anything</br>
which will at least partially be understood by `parse-time-string'.</br>
Unrecognized parts of the date will default to the current day, month, year,</br>
hour and minute.  If this command is called to replace a timestamp at point,</br>
or to enter the second timestamp of a range, the default time is taken</br>
from the existing stamp.  Furthermore, the command prefers the future,</br>
so if you are giving a date where the year is not given, and the day-month</br>
combination is already past in the current year, it will assume you</br>
mean next year.  For details, see the manual.  A few examples:</br>
</br>
  3-2-5         --> 2003-02-05</br>
  feb 15        --> currentyear-02-15</br>
  2/15          --> currentyear-02-15</br>
  sep 12 9      --> 2009-09-12</br>
  12:45         --> today 12:45</br>
  22 sept 0:34  --> currentyear-09-22 0:34</br>
  12            --> currentyear-currentmonth-12</br>
  Fri           --> nearest Friday after today</br>
  -Tue          --> last Tuesday</br>
  etc.</br>
</br>
Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the *first* thing</br>
in the input:  a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter [hdwmy] to indicate</br>
change in days weeks, months, years.</br>
With a single plus or minus, the date is relative to today.  With a double</br>
plus or minus, it is relative to the date in <u>DEFAULT-TIME</u>.  E.g.</br>
  +4d           --> four days from today</br>
  +4            --> same as above</br>
  +2w           --> two weeks from today</br>
  ++5           --> five days from default date</br>
</br>
The function understands only English month and weekday abbreviations.</br>
</br>
While prompting, a calendar is popped up - you can also select the</br>
date with the mouse (button 1).  The calendar shows a period of three</br>
months.  To scroll it to other months, use the keys `>' and `&lt;'.</br>
If you don't like the calendar, turn it off with</br>
       (setq org-read-date-popup-calendar nil)</br>
</br>
With optional argument <u>TO-TIME</u>, the date will immediately be converted</br>
to an internal time.</br>
With an optional argument <u>ORG-WITH-TIME</u>, the prompt will suggest to</br>
also insert a time.  Note that when <u>ORG-WITH-TIME</u> is not set, you can</br>
still enter a time, and this function will inform the calling routine</br>
about this change.  The calling routine may then choose to change the</br>
format used to insert the time stamp into the buffer to include the time.</br>
With optional argument <u>FROM-STRING</u>, read from this string instead from</br>
the user.  <u>PROMPT</u> can overwrite the default prompt.  <u>DEFAULT-TIME</u> is</br>
the time/date that is used for everything that is not specified by the</br>
user.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
