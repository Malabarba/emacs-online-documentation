<strong>org-read-date</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-read-date &optional ORG-WITH-TIME TO-TIME FROM-STRING PROMPT DEFAULT-TIME DEFAULT-INPUT INACTIVE)<br/>
<br/>
Read a date, possibly a time, and make things smooth for the user.<br/>
The prompt will suggest to enter an ISO date, but you can also enter anything<br/>
which will at least partially be understood by `parse-time-string'.<br/>
Unrecognized parts of the date will default to the current day, month, year,<br/>
hour and minute.  If this command is called to replace a timestamp at point,<br/>
or to enter the second timestamp of a range, the default time is taken<br/>
from the existing stamp.  Furthermore, the command prefers the future,<br/>
so if you are giving a date where the year is not given, and the day-month<br/>
combination is already past in the current year, it will assume you<br/>
mean next year.  For details, see the manual.  A few examples:<br/>
<br/>
  3-2-5         --> 2003-02-05<br/>
  feb 15        --> currentyear-02-15<br/>
  2/15          --> currentyear-02-15<br/>
  sep 12 9      --> 2009-09-12<br/>
  12:45         --> today 12:45<br/>
  22 sept 0:34  --> currentyear-09-22 0:34<br/>
  12            --> currentyear-currentmonth-12<br/>
  Fri           --> nearest Friday (today or later)<br/>
  etc.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the *first* thing<br/>
in the input:  a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter [hdwmy] to indicate<br/>
change in days weeks, months, years.<br/>
With a single plus or minus, the date is relative to today.  With a double<br/>
plus or minus, it is relative to the date in DEFAULT-TIME.  E.g.<br/>
  +4d           --> four days from today<br/>
  +4            --> same as above<br/>
  +2w           --> two weeks from today<br/>
  ++5           --> five days from default date<br/>
<br/>
The function understands only English month and weekday abbreviations.<br/>
<br/>
While prompting, a calendar is popped up - you can also select the<br/>
date with the mouse (button 1).  The calendar shows a period of three<br/>
months.  To scroll it to other months, use the keys `>' and `<'.<br/>
If you don't like the calendar, turn it off with<br/>
       (setq org-read-date-popup-calendar nil)<br/>
<br/>
With optional argument TO-TIME, the date will immediately be converted<br/>
to an internal time.<br/>
With an optional argument ORG-WITH-TIME, the prompt will suggest to<br/>
also insert a time.  Note that when ORG-WITH-TIME is not set, you can<br/>
still enter a time, and this function will inform the calling routine<br/>
about this change.  The calling routine may then choose to change the<br/>
format used to insert the time stamp into the buffer to include the time.<br/>
With optional argument FROM-STRING, read from this string instead from<br/>
the user.  PROMPT can overwrite the default prompt.  DEFAULT-TIME is<br/>
the time/date that is used for everything that is not specified by the<br/>
user.
