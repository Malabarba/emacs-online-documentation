org-refile is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-refile &optional GOTO DEFAULT-BUFFER RFLOC)<br/><br/>Move the entry or entries at point to another heading.<br/>The list of target headings is compiled using the information in<br/>`org-refile-targets', which see.<br/><br/>At the target location, the entry is filed as a subitem of the target<br/>heading.  Depending on `org-reverse-note-order', the new subitem will<br/>either be the first or the last subitem.<br/><br/>If there is an active region, all entries in that region will be moved.<br/>However, the region must fulfill the requirement that the first heading<br/>is the first one sets the top-level of the moved text - at most siblings<br/>below it are allowed.<br/><br/>With prefix arg GOTO, the command will only visit the target location<br/>and not actually move anything.<br/><br/>With a double prefix arg C-u C-u, go to the location where the last refiling operation has put the subtree.<br/>With a prefix argument of `2', refile to the running clock.<br/><br/>RFLOC can be a refile location obtained in a different way.<br/><br/>See also `org-refile-use-outline-path' and `org-completion-use-ido'.<br/><br/>If you are using target caching (see `org-refile-use-cache'),<br/>you have to clear the target cache in order to find new targets.<br/>This can be done with a 0 prefix (`C-0 C-c C-w') or a triple<br/>prefix argument (`C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w').
