<strong>org-remember-handler</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-remember.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-remember-handler)<br/>
<br/>
Store stuff from remember.el into an org file.<br/>
When the template has specified a file and a headline, the entry is filed<br/>
there, or in the location defined by `org-default-notes-file' and<br/>
`org-remember-default-headline'.<br/>
<br/>
If no defaults have been defined, or if the current prefix argument<br/>
is 1 (using C-1 C-c C-c to exit remember), an interactive<br/>
process is used to select the target location.<br/>
<br/>
When the prefix is 0 (i.e. when remember is exited with C-0 C-c C-c),<br/>
the entry is filed to the same location as the previous note.<br/>
<br/>
When the prefix is 2 (i.e. when remember is exited with C-2 C-c C-c),<br/>
the entry is filed as a subentry of the entry where the clock is<br/>
currently running.<br/>
<br/>
When C-u has been used as prefix argument, the<br/>
note is stored and Emacs moves point to the new location of the<br/>
note, so that editing can be continued there (similar to<br/>
inserting "%&" into the template).<br/>
<br/>
Before storing the note, the function ensures that the text has an<br/>
org-mode-style headline, i.e. a first line that starts with<br/>
a "*".  If not, a headline is constructed from the current date and<br/>
some additional data.<br/>
<br/>
If the variable `org-adapt-indentation' is non-nil, the entire text is<br/>
also indented so that it starts in the same column as the headline<br/>
(i.e. after the stars).<br/>
<br/>
