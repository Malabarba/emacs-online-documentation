<strong>org-remember</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-remember.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-remember &optional GOTO ORG-FORCE-REMEMBER-TEMPLATE-CHAR)<br/>
<br/>
Call `remember'.  If this is already a remember buffer, re-apply template.<br/>
If there is an active region, make sure remember uses it as initial content<br/>
of the remember buffer.<br/>
<br/>
When called interactively with a C-u prefix argument GOTO, don't remember<br/>
anything, just go to the file/headline where the selected template usually<br/>
stores its notes.  With a double prefix argument C-u C-u, go to the last<br/>
note stored by remember.<br/>
<br/>
Lisp programs can set ORG-FORCE-REMEMBER-TEMPLATE-CHAR to a character<br/>
associated with a template in `org-remember-templates'.
