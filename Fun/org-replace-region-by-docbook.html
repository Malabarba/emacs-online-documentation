<strong>org-replace-region-by-docbook</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-docbook.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-replace-region-by-docbook BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Replace the region from BEG to END with its DocBook export.<br/>
It assumes the region has `org-mode' syntax, and then convert it to<br/>
DocBook.  This can be used in any buffer.  For example, you could<br/>
write an itemized list in `org-mode' syntax in an DocBook buffer and<br/>
then use this command to convert it.
