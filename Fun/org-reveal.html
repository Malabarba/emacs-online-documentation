<strong>org-reveal</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-reveal &optional SIBLINGS)<br/>
<br/>
Show current entry, hierarchy above it, and the following headline.<br/>
This can be used to show a consistent set of context around locations<br/>
exposed with `org-show-hierarchy-above' or `org-show-following-heading'<br/>
not t for the search context.<br/>
<br/>
With optional argument SIBLINGS, on each level of the hierarchy all<br/>
siblings are shown.  This repairs the tree structure to what it would<br/>
look like when opened with hierarchical calls to `org-cycle'.<br/>
With double optional argument C-u C-u, go to the parent and show the<br/>
entire tree.
