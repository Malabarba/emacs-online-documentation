<strong>org-save-markers-in-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-save-markers-in-region BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Check markers in region.<br/>
If these markers are between BEG and END, record their position relative<br/>
to BEG, so that after moving the block of text, we can put the markers back<br/>
into place.<br/>
This function gets called just before an entry or tree gets cut from the<br/>
buffer.  After re-insertion, `org-reinstall-markers-in-region' must be<br/>
called immediately, to move the markers with the entries.
