<strong>org-save-markers-in-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-save-markers-in-region <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Check markers in region.</br>
If these markers are between <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u>, record their position relative</br>
to <u>BEG</u>, so that after moving the block of text, we can put the markers back</br>
into place.</br>
This function gets called just before an entry or tree gets cut from the</br>
buffer.  After re-insertion, `org-reinstall-markers-in-region' must be</br>
called immediately, to move the markers with the entries.
