<strong>org-save-outline-visibility</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>org-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-save-outline-visibility <u>USE-MARKERS</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Save and restore outline visibility around <u>BODY</u>.</br>
If <u>USE-MARKERS</u> is non-nil, use markers for the positions.</br>
This means that the buffer may change while running <u>BODY</u>,</br>
but it also means that the buffer should stay alive</br>
during the operation, because otherwise all these markers will</br>
point nowhere.
