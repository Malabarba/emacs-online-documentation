<strong>org-scan-tags</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-scan-tags <u>ACTION</u> <u>MATCHER</u> <u>TODO-ONLY</u> &optional <u>START-LEVEL</u>)</br>
</br>
Scan headline tags with inheritance and produce output <u>ACTION</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>ACTION</u> can be `sparse-tree' to produce a sparse tree in the current buffer,</br>
or `agenda' to produce an entry list for an agenda view.  It can also be</br>
a Lisp form or a function that should be called at each matched headline, in</br>
this case the return value is a list of all return values from these calls.</br>
</br>
<u>MATCHER</u> is a Lisp form to be evaluated, testing if a given set of tags</br>
qualifies a headline for inclusion.  When <u>TODO-ONLY</u> is non-nil,</br>
only lines with a not-done TODO keyword are included in the output.</br>
This should be the same variable that was scoped into</br>
and set by `org-make-tags-matcher' when it constructed <u>MATCHER</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>START-LEVEL</u> can be a string with asterisks, reducing the scope to</br>
headlines matching this string.
