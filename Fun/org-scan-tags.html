<strong>org-scan-tags</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-scan-tags ACTION MATCHER TODO-ONLY &optional START-LEVEL)<br/>
<br/>
Scan headline tags with inheritance and produce output ACTION.<br/>
<br/>
ACTION can be `sparse-tree' to produce a sparse tree in the current buffer,<br/>
or `agenda' to produce an entry list for an agenda view.  It can also be<br/>
a Lisp form or a function that should be called at each matched headline, in<br/>
this case the return value is a list of all return values from these calls.<br/>
<br/>
MATCHER is a Lisp form to be evaluated, testing if a given set of tags<br/>
qualifies a headline for inclusion.  When TODO-ONLY is non-nil,<br/>
only lines with a not-done TODO keyword are included in the output.<br/>
This should be the same variable that was scoped into<br/>
and set by `org-make-tags-matcher' when it constructed MATCHER.<br/>
<br/>
START-LEVEL can be a string with asterisks, reducing the scope to<br/>
headlines matching this string.
