<strong>org-search-view</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-search-view &optional <u>TODO-ONLY</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>EDIT-AT</u>)</br>
</br>
Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.</br>
</br>
With optional prefix argument <u>TODO-ONLY</u>, only consider entries that are</br>
TODO entries.  The argument <u>STRING</u> can be used to pass a default search</br>
string into this function.  If <u>EDIT-AT</u> is non-nil, it means that the</br>
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position</br>
<u>EDIT-AT</u>.</br>
</br>
The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as</br>
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match</br>
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable</br>
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.</br>
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to</br>
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  "+" or "-".</br>
</br>
The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in</br>
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,</br>
including newlines.</br>
</br>
If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and</br>
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.</br>
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without</br>
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is</br>
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must</br>
match whole words, not parts of a word) if</br>
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).</br>
</br>
Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as</br>
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with "-") must not</br>
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken</br>
as a whole, to include whitespace.</br>
</br>
- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.</br>
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an</br>
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect</br>
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.</br>
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts</br>
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the</br>
  Boolean search must match as full words.</br>
</br>
This command searches the agenda files, and in addition the files listed</br>
in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.
