<strong>org-shorten-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-shorten-string S MAXLENGTH)<br/>
<br/>
Shorten string S so tht it is no longer than MAXLENGTH characters.<br/>
If the string is shorter or has length MAXLENGTH, just return the<br/>
original string.  If it is longer, the functions finds a space in the<br/>
string, breaks this string off at that locations and adds three dots<br/>
as ellipsis.  Including the ellipsis, the string will not be longer<br/>
than MAXLENGTH.  If finding a good breaking point in the string does<br/>
not work, the string is just chopped off in the middle of a word<br/>
if necessary.
