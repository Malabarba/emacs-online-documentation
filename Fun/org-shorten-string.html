<strong>org-shorten-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-shorten-string <u>S</u> <u>MAXLENGTH</u>)</br>
</br>
Shorten string <u>S</u> so tht it is no longer than <u>MAXLENGTH</u> characters.</br>
If the string is shorter or has length <u>MAXLENGTH</u>, just return the</br>
original string.  If it is longer, the functions finds a space in the</br>
string, breaks this string off at that locations and adds three dots</br>
as ellipsis.  Including the ellipsis, the string will not be longer</br>
than <u>MAXLENGTH</u>.  If finding a good breaking point in the string does</br>
not work, the string is just chopped off in the middle of a word</br>
if necessary.
