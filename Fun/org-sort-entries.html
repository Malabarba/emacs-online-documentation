</br>
</br>
(org-sort-entries &optional <u>WITH-CASE</u> <u>SORTING-TYPE</u> <u>GETKEY-FUNC</u> <u>COMPARE-FUNC</u> <u>PROPERTY</u>)</br>
</br>
Sort entries on a certain level of an outline tree.</br>
If there is an active region, the entries in the region are sorted.</br>
Else, if the cursor is before the first entry, sort the top-level items.</br>
Else, the children of the entry at point are sorted.</br>
</br>
Sorting can be alphabetically, numerically, by date/time as given by</br>
a time stamp, by a property, by priority order, or by a custom function.</br>
</br>
The command prompts for the sorting type unless it has been given to the</br>
function through the <u>SORTING-TYPE</u> argument, which needs to be a character,</br>
(?n ?N ?a ?A ?t ?T ?s ?S ?d ?D ?p ?P ?o ?O ?r ?R ?f ?F).  Here is the</br>
precise meaning of each character:</br>
</br>
n   Numerically, by converting the beginning of the entry/item to a number.</br>
a   Alphabetically, ignoring the TODO keyword and the priority, if any.</br>
o   By order of TODO keywords.</br>
t   By date/time, either the first active time stamp in the entry, or, if</br>
    none exist, by the first inactive one.</br>
s   By the scheduled date/time.</br>
d   By deadline date/time.</br>
c   By creation time, which is assumed to be the first inactive time stamp</br>
    at the beginning of a line.</br>
p   By priority according to the cookie.</br>
r   By the value of a property.</br>
</br>
Capital letters will reverse the sort order.</br>
</br>
If the <u>SORTING-TYPE</u> is ?f or ?F, then <u>GETKEY-FUNC</u> specifies a function to be</br>
called with point at the beginning of the record.  It must return either</br>
a string or a number that should serve as the sorting key for that record.</br>
</br>
Comparing entries ignores case by default.  However, with an optional argument</br>
<u>WITH-CASE</u>, the sorting considers case as well.</br>
</br>
Sorting is done against the visible part of the headlines, it ignores hidden</br>
