org-sort-entries is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-sort-entries &optional WITH-CASE SORTING-TYPE GETKEY-FUNC COMPARE-FUNC PROPERTY)<br/><br/>Sort entries on a certain level of an outline tree.<br/>If there is an active region, the entries in the region are sorted.<br/>Else, if the cursor is before the first entry, sort the top-level items.<br/>Else, the children of the entry at point are sorted.<br/><br/>Sorting can be alphabetically, numerically, by date/time as given by<br/>a time stamp, by a property or by priority.<br/><br/>The command prompts for the sorting type unless it has been given to the<br/>function through the SORTING-TYPE argument, which needs to be a character,<br/>(?n ?N ?a ?A ?t ?T ?s ?S ?d ?D ?p ?P ?o ?O ?r ?R ?f ?F).  Here is the<br/>precise meaning of each character:<br/><br/>n   Numerically, by converting the beginning of the entry/item to a number.<br/>a   Alphabetically, ignoring the TODO keyword and the priority, if any.<br/>o   By order of TODO keywords.<br/>t   By date/time, either the first active time stamp in the entry, or, if<br/>    none exist, by the first inactive one.<br/>s   By the scheduled date/time.<br/>d   By deadline date/time.<br/>c   By creation time, which is assumed to be the first inactive time stamp<br/>    at the beginning of a line.<br/>p   By priority according to the cookie.<br/>r   By the value of a property.<br/><br/>Capital letters will reverse the sort order.<br/><br/>If the SORTING-TYPE is ?f or ?F, then GETKEY-FUNC specifies a function to be<br/>called with point at the beginning of the record.  It must return either<br/>a string or a number that should serve as the sorting key for that record.<br/><br/>Comparing entries ignores case by default.  However, with an optional argument<br/>WITH-CASE, the sorting considers case as well.
