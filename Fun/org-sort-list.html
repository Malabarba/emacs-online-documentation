<strong>org-sort-list</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-list.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-sort-list &optional WITH-CASE SORTING-TYPE GETKEY-FUNC COMPARE-FUNC)<br/>
<br/>
Sort list items.<br/>
The cursor may be at any item of the list that should be sorted.<br/>
Sublists are not sorted.  Checkboxes, if any, are ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Sorting can be alphabetically, numerically, by date/time as given<br/>
by a time stamp, by a property or by priority.<br/>
<br/>
Comparing entries ignores case by default.  However, with an<br/>
optional argument WITH-CASE, the sorting considers case as well.<br/>
<br/>
The command prompts for the sorting type unless it has been given<br/>
to the function through the SORTING-TYPE argument, which needs to<br/>
be a character, (?n ?N ?a ?A ?t ?T ?f ?F).  Here is the precise<br/>
meaning of each character:<br/>
<br/>
n   Numerically, by converting the beginning of the item to a number.<br/>
a   Alphabetically.  Only the first line of item is checked.<br/>
t   By date/time, either the first active time stamp in the entry, if<br/>
    any, or by the first inactive one.  In a timer list, sort the timers.<br/>
<br/>
Capital letters will reverse the sort order.<br/>
<br/>
If the SORTING-TYPE is ?f or ?F, then GETKEY-FUNC specifies<br/>
a function to be called with point at the beginning of the<br/>
record.  It must return either a string or a number that should<br/>
serve as the sorting key for that record.  It will then use<br/>
COMPARE-FUNC to compare entries.
