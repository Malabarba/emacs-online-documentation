<strong>org-sort-list</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-list.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-sort-list &optional <u>WITH-CASE</u> <u>SORTING-TYPE</u> <u>GETKEY-FUNC</u> <u>COMPARE-FUNC</u>)</br>
</br>
Sort list items.</br>
The cursor may be at any item of the list that should be sorted.</br>
Sublists are not sorted.  Checkboxes, if any, are ignored.</br>
</br>
Sorting can be alphabetically, numerically, by date/time as given</br>
by a time stamp, by a property or by priority.</br>
</br>
Comparing entries ignores case by default.  However, with an</br>
optional argument <u>WITH-CASE</u>, the sorting considers case as well.</br>
</br>
The command prompts for the sorting type unless it has been given</br>
to the function through the <u>SORTING-TYPE</u> argument, which needs to</br>
be a character, (?n ?N ?a ?A ?t ?T ?f ?F ?x ?X).  Here is the</br>
detailed meaning of each character:</br>
</br>
n   Numerically, by converting the beginning of the item to a number.</br>
a   Alphabetically.  Only the first line of item is checked.</br>
t   By date/time, either the first active time stamp in the entry, if</br>
    any, or by the first inactive one.  In a timer list, sort the timers.</br>
x   By "checked" status of a check list.</br>
</br>
Capital letters will reverse the sort order.</br>
</br>
If the <u>SORTING-TYPE</u> is ?f or ?F, then <u>GETKEY-FUNC</u> specifies</br>
a function to be called with point at the beginning of the</br>
record.  It must return either a string or a number that should</br>
serve as the sorting key for that record.  It will then use</br>
<u>COMPARE-FUNC</u> to compare entries.</br>
</br>
Sorting is done against the visible part of the headlines, it</br>
ignores hidden links.
