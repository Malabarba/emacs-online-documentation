<strong>org-table-convert</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-table-convert)<br/>
<br/>
Convert from `org-mode' table to table.el and back.<br/>
Obviously, this only works within limits.  When an Org-mode table is<br/>
converted to table.el, all horizontal separator lines get lost, because<br/>
table.el uses these as cell boundaries and has no notion of horizontal lines.<br/>
A table.el table can be converted to an Org-mode table only if it does not<br/>
do row or column spanning.  Multiline cells will become multiple cells.<br/>
Beware, Org-mode does not test if the table can be successfully converted - it<br/>
blindly applies a recipe that works for simple tables.
