<strong>org-table-copy-down</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-table-copy-down N)<br/>
<br/>
Copy a field down in the current column.<br/>
If the field at the cursor is empty, copy into it the content of<br/>
the nearest non-empty field above.  With argument N, use the Nth<br/>
non-empty field.  If the current field is not empty, it is copied<br/>
down to the next row, and the cursor is moved with it.<br/>
Therefore, repeating this command causes the column to be filled<br/>
row-by-row.<br/>
If the variable `org-table-copy-increment' is non-nil and the<br/>
field is an integer or a timestamp, it will be incremented while<br/>
copying.  In the case of a timestamp, increment by one day.
