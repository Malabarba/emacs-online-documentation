</br>
</br>
(org-table-eval-formula &optional <u>ARG</u> <u>EQUATION</u> <u>SUPPRESS-ALIGN</u> <u>SUPPRESS-CONST</u> <u>SUPPRESS-STORE</u> <u>SUPPRESS-ANALYSIS</u>)</br>
</br>
Replace the table field value at the cursor by the result of a calculation.</br>
</br>
This function makes use of Dave Gillespie's Calc package, in my view the</br>
most exciting program ever written for GNU Emacs.  So you need to have Calc</br>
installed in order to use this function.</br>
</br>
In a table, this command replaces the value in the current field with the</br>
result of a formula.  It also installs the formula as the "current" column</br>
formula, by storing it in a special line below the table.  When called</br>
with a `C-u' prefix, the current field must be a named field, and the</br>
formula is installed as valid in only this specific field.</br>
</br>
When called with two `C-u' prefixes, insert the active equation</br>
for the field back into the current field, so that it can be</br>
edited there.  This is useful in order to use M-x org-table-show-reference</br>
to check the referenced fields.</br>
</br>
When called, the command first prompts for a formula, which is read in</br>
the minibuffer.  Previously entered formulas are available through the</br>
history list, and the last used formula is offered as a default.</br>
These stored formulas are adapted correctly when moving, inserting, or</br>
deleting columns with the corresponding commands.</br>
</br>
The formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Calc package.</br>
For details, see the Org-mode manual.</br>
</br>
This function can also be called from Lisp programs and offers</br>
additional arguments: <u>EQUATION</u> can be the formula to apply.  If this</br>
argument is given, the user will not be prompted.  <u>SUPPRESS-ALIGN</u> is</br>
used to speed-up recursive calls by by-passing unnecessary aligns.</br>
<u>SUPPRESS-CONST</u> suppresses the interpretation of constants in the</br>
formula, assuming that this has been done already outside the function.</br>
<u>SUPPRESS-STORE</u> means the formula should not be stored, either because</br>
it is already stored, or because it is a modified equation that should</br>
not overwrite the stored one.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
