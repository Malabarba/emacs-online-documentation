org-table-recalculate is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `org-table.el'.<br/><br/>(org-table-recalculate &optional ALL NOALIGN)<br/><br/>Recalculate the current table line by applying all stored formulas.<br/>With prefix arg ALL, do this for all lines in the table.<br/>With the prefix argument ALL is `(16)' (a double M-x universal-prefix M-x universal-prefix prefix), or if<br/>it is the symbol `iterate', recompute the table until it no longer changes.<br/>If NOALIGN is not nil, do not re-align the table after the computations<br/>are done.  This is typically used internally to save time, if it is<br/>known that the table will be realigned a little later anyway.
