<strong>org-table-sort-lines</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>org-table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-table-sort-lines WITH-CASE &optional SORTING-TYPE)<br/>
<br/>
Sort table lines according to the column at point.<br/>
<br/>
The position of point indicates the column to be used for<br/>
sorting, and the range of lines is the range between the nearest<br/>
horizontal separator lines, or the entire table of no such lines<br/>
exist.  If point is before the first column, you will be prompted<br/>
for the sorting column.  If there is an active region, the mark<br/>
specifies the first line and the sorting column, while point<br/>
should be in the last line to be included into the sorting.<br/>
<br/>
The command then prompts for the sorting type which can be<br/>
alphabetically, numerically, or by time (as given in a time stamp<br/>
in the field).  Sorting in reverse order is also possible.<br/>
<br/>
With prefix argument WITH-CASE, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
If SORTING-TYPE is specified when this function is called from a Lisp<br/>
program, no prompting will take place.  SORTING-TYPE must be a character,<br/>
any of (?a ?A ?n ?N ?t ?T) where the capital letter indicate that sorting<br/>
should be done in reverse order.
