</br>
</br>
(org-table-wrap-region <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Wrap several fields in a column like a paragraph.</br>
This is useful if you'd like to spread the contents of a field over several</br>
lines, in order to keep the table compact.</br>
</br>
If there is an active region, and both point and mark are in the same column,</br>
the text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given number of</br>
lines.  Generally, this makes the table more compact.  A prefix <u>ARG</u> may be</br>
used to change the number of desired lines.  For example, `C-2 M-x org-table-wrap'</br>
formats the selected text to two lines.  If the region was longer than two</br>
lines, the remaining lines remain empty.  A negative prefix argument reduces</br>
the current number of lines by that amount.  The wrapped text is pasted back</br>
into the table.  If you formatted it to more lines than it was before, fields</br>
further down in the table get overwritten - so you might need to make space in</br>
the table first.</br>
</br>
If there is no region, the current field is split at the cursor position and</br>
the text fragment to the right of the cursor is prepended to the field one</br>
line down.</br>
</br>
If there is no region, but you specify a prefix <u>ARG</u>, the current field gets</br>
blank, and the content is appended to the field above.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
