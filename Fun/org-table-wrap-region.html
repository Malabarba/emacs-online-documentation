org-table-wrap-region is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `org-table.el'.<br/><br/>(org-table-wrap-region ARG)<br/><br/>Wrap several fields in a column like a paragraph.<br/>This is useful if you'd like to spread the contents of a field over several<br/>lines, in order to keep the table compact.<br/><br/>If there is an active region, and both point and mark are in the same column,<br/>the text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given number of<br/>lines.  Generally, this makes the table more compact.  A prefix ARG may be<br/>used to change the number of desired lines.  For example, `C-2 M-x org-table-wrap'<br/>formats the selected text to two lines.  If the region was longer than two<br/>lines, the remaining lines remain empty.  A negative prefix argument reduces<br/>the current number of lines by that amount.  The wrapped text is pasted back<br/>into the table.  If you formatted it to more lines than it was before, fields<br/>further down in the table get overwritten - so you might need to make space in<br/>the table first.<br/><br/>If there is no region, the current field is split at the cursor position and<br/>the text fragment to the right of the cursor is prepended to the field one<br/>line down.<br/><br/>If there is no region, but you specify a prefix ARG, the current field gets<br/>blank, and the content is appended to the field above.
