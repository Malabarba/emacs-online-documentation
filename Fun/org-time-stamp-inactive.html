<strong>org-time-stamp-inactive</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-time-stamp-inactive &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert an inactive time stamp.</br>
An inactive time stamp is enclosed in square brackets instead of angle</br>
brackets.  It is inactive in the sense that it does not trigger agenda entries,</br>
does not link to the calendar and cannot be changed with the S-cursor keys.</br>
So these are more for recording a certain time/date.
