<strong>org-timer-start</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-timer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-timer-start &optional <u>OFFSET</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the starting time for the relative timer to now.</br>
When called with prefix argument <u>OFFSET</u>, prompt the user for an offset time,</br>
with the default taken from a timer stamp at point, if any.</br>
If <u>OFFSET</u> is a string or an integer, it is directly taken to be the offset</br>
without user interaction.</br>
When called with a double prefix arg, all timer strings in the active</br>
region will be shifted by a specific amount.  You will be prompted for</br>
the amount, with the default to make the first timer string in</br>
the region 0:00:00.
