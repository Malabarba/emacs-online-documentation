<strong>org-timer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>org-timer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-timer &optional RESTART NO-INSERT-P)<br/>
<br/>
Insert a H:MM:SS string from the timer into the buffer.<br/>
The first time this command is used, the timer is started.  When used with<br/>
a C-u prefix, force restarting the timer.<br/>
When used with a double prefix argument C-u, change all the timer string<br/>
in the region by a fixed amount.  This can be used to recalibrate a timer<br/>
that was not started at the correct moment.<br/>
<br/>
If NO-INSERT-P is non-nil, return the string instead of inserting<br/>
it in the buffer.
