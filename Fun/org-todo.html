<strong>org-todo</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(org-todo &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Change the TODO state of an item.</br>
The state of an item is given by a keyword at the start of the heading,</br>
like</br>
     *** TODO Write paper</br>
     *** DONE Call mom</br>
</br>
The different keywords are specified in the variable `org-todo-keywords'.</br>
By default the available states are "TODO" and "DONE".</br>
So for this example: when the item starts with TODO, it is changed to DONE.</br>
When it starts with DONE, the DONE is removed.  And when neither TODO nor</br>
DONE are present, add TODO at the beginning of the heading.</br>
</br>
With C-u prefix arg, use completion to determine the new state.</br>
With numeric prefix arg, switch to that state.</br>
With a double C-u prefix, switch to the next set of TODO keywords (nextset).</br>
With a triple C-u prefix, circumvent any state blocking.</br>
With a numeric prefix arg of 0, inhibit note taking for the change.</br>
</br>
For calling through lisp, arg is also interpreted in the following way:</br>
'none             -> empty state</br>
""(empty string)  -> switch to empty state</br>
'done             -> switch to DONE</br>
'nextset          -> switch to the next set of keywords</br>
'previousset      -> switch to the previous set of keywords</br>
"WAITING"         -> switch to the specified keyword, but only if it</br>
                     really is a member of `org-todo-keywords'.
