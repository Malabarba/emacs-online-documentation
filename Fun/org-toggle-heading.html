<strong>org-toggle-heading</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-toggle-heading &optional NSTARS)<br/>
<br/>
Convert headings to normal text, or items or text to headings.<br/>
If there is no active region, only the current line is considered.<br/>
<br/>
With a C-u prefix, convert the whole list at<br/>
point into heading.<br/>
<br/>
In a region:<br/>
<br/>
- If the first non blank line is an headline, remove the stars<br/>
  from all headlines in the region.<br/>
<br/>
- If it is a normal line turn each and every normal line (i.e. not an<br/>
  heading or an item) in the region into a heading.<br/>
<br/>
- If it is a plain list item, turn all plain list items into headings.<br/>
<br/>
When converting a line into a heading, the number of stars is chosen<br/>
such that the lines become children of the current entry.  However,<br/>
when a prefix argument is given, its value determines the number of<br/>
stars to add.
