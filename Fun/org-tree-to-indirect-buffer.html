<strong>org-tree-to-indirect-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(org-tree-to-indirect-buffer &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Create indirect buffer and narrow it to current subtree.<br/>
With a numerical prefix ARG, go up to this level and then take that tree.<br/>
If ARG is negative, go up that many levels.<br/>
<br/>
If `org-indirect-buffer-display' is not `new-frame', the command removes the<br/>
indirect buffer previously made with this command, to avoid proliferation of<br/>
indirect buffers.  However, when you call the command with a C-u prefix, or<br/>
when `org-indirect-buffer-display' is `new-frame', the last buffer<br/>
is kept so that you can work with several indirect buffers at the same time.<br/>
If `org-indirect-buffer-display' is `dedicated-frame', the C-u prefix also<br/>
requests that a new frame be made for the new buffer, so that the dedicated<br/>
frame is not changed.
