</br>
</br>
(org-tree-to-indirect-buffer &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Create indirect buffer and narrow it to current subtree.</br>
With a numerical prefix <u>ARG</u>, go up to this level and then take that tree.</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is negative, go up that many levels.</br>
</br>
If `org-indirect-buffer-display' is not `new-frame', the command removes the</br>
indirect buffer previously made with this command, to avoid proliferation of</br>
indirect buffers.  However, when you call the command with a C-u prefix, or</br>
when `org-indirect-buffer-display' is `new-frame', the last buffer</br>
is kept so that you can work with several indirect buffers at the same time.</br>
If `org-indirect-buffer-display' is `dedicated-frame', the C-u prefix also</br>
requests that a new frame be made for the new buffer, so that the dedicated</br>
frame is not changed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
