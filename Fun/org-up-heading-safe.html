<strong>org-up-heading-safe</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-up-heading-safe)</br>
</br>
Move to the heading line of which the present line is a subheading.</br>
This version will not throw an error.  It will return the level of the</br>
headline found, or nil if no higher level is found.</br>
</br>
Also, this function will be a lot faster than `outline-up-heading',</br>
because it relies on stars being the outline starters.  This can really</br>
make a significant difference in outlines with very many siblings.
