<strong>org-wrap</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(org-wrap <u>STRING</u> &optional <u>WIDTH</u> <u>LINES</u>)</br>
</br>
Wrap string to either a number of lines, or a width in characters.</br>
If <u>WIDTH</u> is non-nil, the string is wrapped to that width, however many lines</br>
that costs.  If there is a word longer than <u>WIDTH</u>, the text is actually</br>
wrapped to the length of that word.</br>
IF <u>WIDTH</u> is nil and <u>LINES</u> is non-nil, the string is forced into at most that</br>
many lines, whatever width that takes.</br>
The return value is a list of lines, without newlines at the end.
