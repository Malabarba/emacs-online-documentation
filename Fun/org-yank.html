org-yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `org.el'.<br/><br/>(org-yank &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Yank.  If the kill is a subtree, treat it specially.<br/>This command will look at the current kill and check if is a single<br/>subtree, or a series of subtrees[1].  If it passes the test, and if the<br/>cursor is at the beginning of a line or after the stars of a currently<br/>empty headline, then the yank is handled specially.  How exactly depends<br/>on the value of the following variables, both set by default.<br/><br/>org-yank-folded-subtrees<br/>    When set, the subtree(s) will be folded after insertion, but only<br/>    if doing so would now swallow text after the yanked text.<br/><br/>org-yank-adjusted-subtrees<br/>    When set, the subtree will be promoted or demoted in order to<br/>    fit into the local outline tree structure, which means that the level<br/>    will be adjusted so that it becomes the smaller one of the two<br/>    *visible* surrounding headings.<br/><br/>Any prefix to this command will cause `yank' to be called directly with<br/>no special treatment.  In particular, a simple C-u prefix will just<br/>plainly yank the text as it is.<br/><br/>[1] The test checks if the first non-white line is a heading<br/>    and if there are no other headings with fewer stars.
