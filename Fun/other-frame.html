other-frame is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `frame.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x 5 o.<br/><br/>(other-frame ARG)<br/><br/>Select the ARGth different visible frame on current display, and raise it.<br/>All frames are arranged in a cyclic order.<br/>This command selects the frame ARG steps away in that order.<br/>A negative ARG moves in the opposite order.<br/><br/>To make this command work properly, you must tell Emacs<br/>how the system (or the window manager) generally handles<br/>focus-switching between windows.  If moving the mouse onto a window<br/>selects it (gives it focus), set `focus-follows-mouse' to t.<br/>Otherwise, that variable should be nil.
