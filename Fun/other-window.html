<strong>other-window</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x o.<br/>
<br/>
(other-window COUNT &optional ALL-FRAMES)<br/>
<br/>
Select another window in cyclic ordering of windows.<br/>
COUNT specifies the number of windows to skip, starting with the<br/>
selected window, before making the selection.  If COUNT is<br/>
positive, skip COUNT windows forwards.  If COUNT is negative,<br/>
skip -COUNT windows backwards.  COUNT zero means do not skip any<br/>
window, so select the selected window.  In an interactive call,<br/>
COUNT is the numeric prefix argument.  Return nil.<br/>
<br/>
If the `other-window' parameter of the selected window is a<br/>
function and `ignore-window-parameters' is nil, call that<br/>
function with the arguments COUNT and ALL-FRAMES.<br/>
<br/>
This function does not select a window whose `no-other-window'<br/>
window parameter is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
This function uses `next-window' for finding the window to<br/>
select.  The argument ALL-FRAMES has the same meaning as in<br/>
`next-window', but the MINIBUF argument of `next-window' is<br/>
always effectively nil.
