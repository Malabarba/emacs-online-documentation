<strong>outline-head-from-level</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>outline.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(outline-head-from-level LEVEL HEAD &optional ALIST)<br/>
<br/>
Get new heading with level LEVEL from ALIST.<br/>
If there are no such entries, return nil.<br/>
ALIST defaults to `outline-heading-alist'.<br/>
Similar to (car (rassoc LEVEL ALIST)).<br/>
If there are several different entries with same new level, choose<br/>
the one with the smallest distance to the association of HEAD in the alist.<br/>
This makes it possible for promotion to work in modes with several<br/>
independent sets of headings (numbered, unnumbered, appendix...)
