outline-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `outline.el'.<br/><br/>(outline-mode)<br/><br/>Parent mode: `text-mode'.<br/><br/>Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.<br/>Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,<br/>two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.<br/><br/>Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily<br/>invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end<br/>of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked<br/>back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).<br/><br/>Commands:<br/>C-c C-n   outline-next-visible-heading      move by visible headings<br/>C-c C-p   outline-previous-visible-heading<br/>C-c C-f   outline-forward-same-level        similar but skip subheadings<br/>C-c C-b   outline-backward-same-level<br/>C-c C-u   outline-up-heading		    move from subheading to heading<br/><br/>C-c C-t	make all text invisible (not headings).<br/>C-c C-a	make everything in buffer visible.<br/>C-c C-q  make only the first N levels of headers visible.<br/><br/>The remaining commands are used when point is on a heading line.<br/>They apply to some of the body or subheadings of that heading.<br/>C-c C-d   hide-subtree	make body and subheadings invisible.<br/>C-c C-s   show-subtree	make body and subheadings visible.<br/>C-c TAB   show-children	make direct subheadings visible.<br/>		 No effect on body, or subheadings 2 or more levels down.<br/>		 With arg N, affects subheadings N levels down.<br/>C-c C-c	   make immediately following body invisible.<br/>C-c C-e	   make it visible.<br/>C-c C-l	   make body under heading and under its subheadings invisible.<br/>		     The subheadings remain visible.<br/>C-c C-k  make all subheadings at all levels visible.<br/><br/>The variable `outline-regexp' can be changed to control what is a heading.<br/>A line is a heading if `outline-regexp' matches something at the<br/>beginning of the line.  The longer the match, the deeper the level.<br/><br/>Turning on outline mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook' and then of<br/>`outline-mode-hook', if they are non-nil.
