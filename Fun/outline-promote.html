<strong>outline-promote</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>outline.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(outline-promote &optional WHICH)<br/>
<br/>
Promote headings higher up the tree.<br/>
If transient-mark-mode is on, and mark is active, promote headings in<br/>
the region (from a Lisp program, pass `region' for WHICH).  Otherwise:<br/>
without prefix argument, promote current heading and all headings in the<br/>
subtree (from a Lisp program, pass `subtree' for WHICH); with prefix<br/>
argument, promote just the current heading (from a Lisp program, pass<br/>
nil for WHICH, or do not pass any argument).
