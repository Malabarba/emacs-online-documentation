<strong>overlay-recenter</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(overlay-recenter POS)<br/>
<br/>
Recenter the overlays of the current buffer around position POS.<br/>
That makes overlay lookup faster for positions near POS (but perhaps slower<br/>
for positions far away from POS).
