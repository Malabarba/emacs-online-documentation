<strong>package-show-package-list</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>package.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(package-show-package-list PACKAGES)<br/>
<br/>
Display PACKAGES in a *Packages* buffer.<br/>
This is similar to `list-packages', but it does not fetch the<br/>
updated list of packages, and it only displays packages with<br/>
names in PACKAGES (which should be a list of symbols).
