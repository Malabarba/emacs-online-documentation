<strong>parse-partial-sexp</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(parse-partial-sexp FROM TO &optional TARGETDEPTH STOPBEFORE OLDSTATE COMMENTSTOP)<br/>
<br/>
Parse Lisp syntax starting at FROM until TO; return status of parse at TO.<br/>
Parsing stops at TO or when certain criteria are met;<br/>
 point is set to where parsing stops.<br/>
If fifth arg OLDSTATE is omitted or nil,<br/>
 parsing assumes that FROM is the beginning of a function.<br/>
Value is a list of elements describing final state of parsing:<br/>
 0. depth in parens.<br/>
 1. character address of start of innermost containing list; nil if none.<br/>
 2. character address of start of last complete sexp terminated.<br/>
 3. non-nil if inside a string.<br/>
    (it is the character that will terminate the string,<br/>
     or t if the string should be terminated by a generic string delimiter.)<br/>
 4. nil if outside a comment, t if inside a non-nestable comment,<br/>
    else an integer (the current comment nesting).<br/>
 5. t if following a quote character.<br/>
 6. the minimum paren-depth encountered during this scan.<br/>
 7. style of comment, if any.<br/>
 8. character address of start of comment or string; nil if not in one.<br/>
 9. Intermediate data for continuation of parsing (subject to change).<br/>
If third arg TARGETDEPTH is non-nil, parsing stops if the depth<br/>
in parentheses becomes equal to TARGETDEPTH.<br/>
Fourth arg STOPBEFORE non-nil means stop when come to<br/>
 any character that starts a sexp.<br/>
Fifth arg OLDSTATE is a list like what this function returns.<br/>
 It is used to initialize the state of the parse.  Elements number 1, 2, 6<br/>
 are ignored.<br/>
Sixth arg COMMENTSTOP non-nil means stop at the start of a comment.<br/>
 If it is symbol `syntax-table', stop after the start of a comment or a<br/>
 string, or after end of a comment or a string.
