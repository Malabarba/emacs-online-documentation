<strong>pascal-comment-area</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>pascal.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(pascal-comment-area <u>START</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Put the region into a Pascal comment.</br>
The comments that are in this area are "deformed":</br>
`*)' becomes `!(*' and `}' becomes `!{'.</br>
These deformed comments are returned to normal if you use</br>
C-c C-u to undo the commenting.</br>
</br>
The commented area starts with `pascal-exclude-str-start', and ends</br>
with `pascal-exclude-str-end'.  But if you change these variables,</br>
C-c C-u won't recognize the comments.
