pcase is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `pcase.el'.<br/><br/>(pcase EXP &rest CASES)<br/><br/>Perform ML-style pattern matching on EXP.<br/>CASES is a list of elements of the form (UPATTERN CODE...).<br/><br/>UPatterns can take the following forms:<br/>  _		matches anything.<br/>  SELFQUOTING	matches itself.  This includes keywords, numbers, and strings.<br/>  SYMBOL	matches anything and binds it to SYMBOL.<br/>  (or UPAT...)	matches if any of the patterns matches.<br/>  (and UPAT...)	matches if all the patterns match.<br/>  `QPAT		matches if the QPattern QPAT matches.<br/>  (pred PRED)	matches if PRED applied to the object returns non-nil.<br/>  (guard BOOLEXP)	matches if BOOLEXP evaluates to non-nil.<br/>  (let UPAT EXP)	matches if EXP matches UPAT.<br/>If a SYMBOL is used twice in the same pattern (i.e. the pattern is<br/>"non-linear"), then the second occurrence is turned into an `eq'uality test.<br/><br/>QPatterns can take the following forms:<br/>  (QPAT1 . QPAT2)	matches if QPAT1 matches the car and QPAT2 the cdr.<br/>  ,UPAT			matches if the UPattern UPAT matches.<br/>  STRING		matches if the object is `equal' to STRING.<br/>  ATOM			matches if the object is `eq' to ATOM.<br/>QPatterns for vectors are not implemented yet.<br/><br/>PRED can take the form<br/>  FUNCTION	     in which case it gets called with one argument.<br/>  (FUN ARG1 .. ARGN) in which case it gets called with an N+1'th argument<br/>                        which is the value being matched.<br/>A PRED of the form FUNCTION is equivalent to one of the form (FUNCTION).<br/>PRED patterns can refer to variables bound earlier in the pattern.<br/>E.g. you can match pairs where the cdr is larger than the car with a pattern<br/>like `(,a . ,(pred (< a))) or, with more checks:<br/>`(,(and a (pred numberp)) . ,(and (pred numberp) (pred (< a))))
