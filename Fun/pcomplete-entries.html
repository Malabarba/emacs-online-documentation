<strong>pcomplete-entries</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>pcomplete.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(pcomplete-entries &optional REGEXP PREDICATE)<br/>
<br/>
Complete against a list of directory candidates.<br/>
If REGEXP is non-nil, it is a regular expression used to refine the<br/>
match (files not matching the REGEXP will be excluded).<br/>
If PREDICATE is non-nil, it will also be used to refine the match<br/>
(files for which the PREDICATE returns nil will be excluded).<br/>
If no directory information can be extracted from the completed<br/>
component, `default-directory' is used as the basis for completion.
