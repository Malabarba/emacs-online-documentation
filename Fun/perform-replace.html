<strong>perform-replace</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(perform-replace <u>FROM-STRING</u> <u>REPLACEMENTS</u> <u>QUERY-FLAG</u> <u>REGEXP-FLAG</u> <u>DELIMITED-FLAG</u> &optional <u>REPEAT-COUNT</u> <u>MAP</u> <u>START</u> <u>END</u> <u>BACKWARD</u>)</br>
</br>
Subroutine of `query-replace'.  Its complexity handles interactive queries.</br>
Don't use this in your own program unless you want to query and set the mark</br>
just as `query-replace' does.  Instead, write a simple loop like this:</br>
</br>
  (while (re-search-forward "foo[ \t]+bar" nil t)</br>
    (replace-match "foobar" nil nil))</br>
</br>
which will run faster and probably do exactly what you want.  Please</br>
see the documentation of `replace-match' to find out how to simulate</br>
`case-replace'.</br>
</br>
This function returns nil if and only if there were no matches to</br>
make, or the user didn't cancel the call.
