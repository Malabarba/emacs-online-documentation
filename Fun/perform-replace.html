<strong>perform-replace</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(perform-replace FROM-STRING REPLACEMENTS QUERY-FLAG REGEXP-FLAG DELIMITED-FLAG &optional REPEAT-COUNT MAP START END)<br/>
<br/>
Subroutine of `query-replace'.  Its complexity handles interactive queries.<br/>
Don't use this in your own program unless you want to query and set the mark<br/>
just as `query-replace' does.  Instead, write a simple loop like this:<br/>
<br/>
  (while (re-search-forward "foo[ \t]+bar" nil t)<br/>
    (replace-match "foobar" nil nil))<br/>
<br/>
which will run faster and probably do exactly what you want.  Please<br/>
see the documentation of `replace-match' to find out how to simulate<br/>
`case-replace'.<br/>
<br/>
This function returns nil if and only if there were no matches to<br/>
make, or the user didn't cancel the call.
