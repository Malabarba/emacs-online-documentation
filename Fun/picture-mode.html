<strong>picture-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>picture.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(picture-mode)<br/>
<br/>
Switch to Picture mode, in which a quarter-plane screen model is used.<br/>
<br/>
Printing characters replace instead of inserting themselves with motion<br/>
afterwards settable by these commands:<br/>
<br/>
 Move left after insertion:            C-c <<br/>
 Move right after insertion:           C-c ><br/>
 Move up after insertion:              C-c ^<br/>
 Move down after insertion:            C-c .<br/>
<br/>
 Move northwest (nw) after insertion:  C-c `<br/>
 Move northeast (ne) after insertion:  C-c '<br/>
 Move southwest (sw) after insertion:  C-c /<br/>
 Move southeast (se) after insertion:  C-c \<br/>
<br/>
 Move westnorthwest (wnw) after insertion:  C-u C-c `<br/>
 Move eastnortheast (ene) after insertion:  C-u C-c '<br/>
 Move westsouthwest (wsw) after insertion:  C-u C-c /<br/>
 Move eastsoutheast (ese) after insertion:  C-u C-c \<br/>
<br/>
The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial<br/>
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to<br/>
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer<br/>
with these commands:<br/>
<br/>
 Move vertically to SAME column in previous line: C-n<br/>
 Move vertically to SAME column in next line:     C-p<br/>
 Move to column following last<br/>
  non-whitespace character:                       C-e<br/>
 Move right, inserting spaces if required:        C-f<br/>
 Move left changing tabs to spaces if required:   C-b<br/>
 Move in direction of current picture motion:     C-c C-f<br/>
 Move opposite to current picture motion:         C-c C-b<br/>
 Move to beginning of next line:                  C-n<br/>
<br/>
You can edit tabular text with these commands:<br/>
<br/>
 Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting<br/>
  character (see variable `picture-tab-chars'):   C-M-i<br/>
 Move to next stop in tab stop list:              TAB<br/>
 Set tab stops according to context of this line: C-c TAB<br/>
   (With ARG, resets tab stops to default value.)<br/>
 Change the tab stop list:                        M-x edit-tab-stops<br/>
<br/>
You can manipulate text with these commands:<br/>
 Clear ARG columns after point without moving:    C-d<br/>
 Delete char at point:                            C-c C-d<br/>
 Clear ARG columns backward:                      DEL<br/>
 Clear ARG lines, advancing over them:            C-k<br/>
  (the cleared text is saved in the kill ring)<br/>
 Open blank line(s) beneath current line:         C-o<br/>
<br/>
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:<br/>
  Clear a rectangle and save it:                  C-c C-k<br/>
  Clear a rectangle, saving in a named register:  C-c C-w<br/>
  Insert currently saved rectangle at point:      C-c C-y<br/>
  Insert rectangle from named register:           C-c C-x<br/>
  Draw a rectangular box around mark and point:   C-c C-r<br/>
  Copies a rectangle to a register:               C-x r r<br/>
  Undo effects of rectangle overlay commands:     C-x u<br/>
<br/>
You can return to the previous mode with C-c C-c, which<br/>
also strips trailing whitespace from every line.  Stripping is suppressed<br/>
by supplying an argument.<br/>
<br/>
Entry to this mode calls the value of `picture-mode-hook' if non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but<br/>
they are not by default assigned to keys.
