<strong>picture-set-tab-stops</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>picture.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(picture-set-tab-stops &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Set value of `tab-stop-list' according to context of this line.</br>
This controls the behavior of M-x picture-tab.  A tab stop is set at</br>
every column occupied by an "interesting character" that is preceded</br>
by whitespace.  Interesting characters are defined by the variable</br>
`picture-tab-chars', see its documentation for an example of usage.</br>
With <u>ARG</u>, just (re)set `tab-stop-list' to its default value.  The tab</br>
stops computed are displayed in the minibuffer with `:' at each stop.
