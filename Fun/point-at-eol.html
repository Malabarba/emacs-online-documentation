<strong>point-at-eol</strong> is an alias for `line-end-position' in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(point-at-eol &optional N)<br/>
<br/>
Return the character position of the last character on the current line.<br/>
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.<br/>
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.<br/>
<br/>
This function ignores text display directionality; it returns the<br/>
position of the last character in logical order, i.e. the largest<br/>
character position on the line.<br/>
<br/>
This function constrains the returned position to the current field<br/>
unless that would be on a different line than the original,<br/>
unconstrained result.  If N is nil or 1, and a rear-sticky field ends<br/>
at point, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field<br/>
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.<br/>
<br/>
This function does not move point.
