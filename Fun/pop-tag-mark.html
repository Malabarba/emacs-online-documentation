<strong>pop-tag-mark</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>etags.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to M-*.</br>
</br>
<code>(pop-tag-mark</code>)</br>
</br>
Pop back to where M-. was last invoked.</br>
</br>
This is distinct from invoking M-. with a negative argument</br>
since that pops a stack of markers at which tags were found, not from</br>
where they were found.
