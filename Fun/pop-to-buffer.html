<strong>pop-to-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(pop-to-buffer BUFFER &optional ACTION NORECORD)<br/>
<br/>
Select buffer BUFFER in some window, preferably a different one.<br/>
BUFFER may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or nil.  If it<br/>
is a string not naming an existent buffer, create a buffer with<br/>
that name.  If BUFFER is nil, choose some other buffer.  Return<br/>
the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
This uses `display-buffer' as a subroutine.  The optional ACTION<br/>
argument is passed to `display-buffer' as its ACTION argument.<br/>
See `display-buffer' for more information.  ACTION is t if called<br/>
interactively with a prefix argument, which means to pop to a<br/>
window other than the selected one even if the buffer is already<br/>
displayed in the selected window.<br/>
<br/>
If the window to show BUFFER is not on the selected<br/>
frame, raise that window's frame and give it input focus.<br/>
<br/>
Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer<br/>
at the front of the list of recently selected ones.
