<strong>pos-visible-in-window-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(pos-visible-in-window-p &optional POS WINDOW PARTIALLY)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if position POS is currently on the frame in WINDOW.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
<br/>
Return nil if that position is scrolled vertically out of view.  If a<br/>
character is only partially visible, nil is returned, unless the<br/>
optional argument PARTIALLY is non-nil.  If POS is only out of view<br/>
because of horizontal scrolling, return non-nil.  If POS is t, it<br/>
specifies the position of the last visible glyph in WINDOW.  POS<br/>
defaults to point in WINDOW; WINDOW defaults to the selected window.<br/>
<br/>
If POS is visible, return t if PARTIALLY is nil; if PARTIALLY is non-nil,<br/>
return value is a list of 2 or 6 elements (X Y [RTOP RBOT ROWH VPOS]),<br/>
where X and Y are the pixel coordinates relative to the top left corner<br/>
of the window.  The remaining elements are omitted if the character after<br/>
POS is fully visible; otherwise, RTOP and RBOT are the number of pixels<br/>
off-window at the top and bottom of the row, ROWH is the height of the<br/>
display row, and VPOS is the row number (0-based) containing POS.
