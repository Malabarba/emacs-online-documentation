</br>
(posn-col-row <u>POSITION</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the nominal column and row in <u>POSITION</u>, measured in characters.</br>
The column and row values are approximations calculated from the x</br>
and y coordinates in <u>POSITION</u> and the frame's default character width</br>
and default line height, including spacing.</br>
For a scroll-bar event, the result column is 0, and the row</br>
corresponds to the vertical position of the click in the scroll bar.</br>
<u>POSITION</u> should be a list of the form returned by the `event-start'</br>
and `event-end' functions.
