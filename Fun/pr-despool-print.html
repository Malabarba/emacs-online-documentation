pr-despool-print is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `printing.el'.<br/><br/>(pr-despool-print &optional FILENAME)<br/><br/>Send the spooled PostScript to the printer.<br/><br/>Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the<br/>user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file<br/>instead of sending it to the printer.<br/><br/>Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,<br/>send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript<br/>image in a file with that name.
