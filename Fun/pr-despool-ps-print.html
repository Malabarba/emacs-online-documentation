<strong>pr-despool-ps-print</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>printing.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(pr-despool-ps-print &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Send the spooled PostScript to the printer or use ghostscript to print it.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the<br/>
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file<br/>
instead of sending it to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,<br/>
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript<br/>
image in a file with that name.
