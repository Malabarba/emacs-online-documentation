<strong>pr-ps-buffer-print</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>printing.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(pr-ps-buffer-print N-UP &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Print buffer using PostScript printer.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number and, when you use a<br/>
prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the user for a file name, and saves<br/>
the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  The<br/>
argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil, send the image to the<br/>
printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript image in a file with<br/>
that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a file name.
