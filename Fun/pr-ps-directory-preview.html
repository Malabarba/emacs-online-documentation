<strong>pr-ps-directory-preview</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>printing.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(pr-ps-directory-preview N-UP DIR FILE-REGEXP &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Preview directory using ghostview.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, the command prompts for N-UP printing number, a directory, a<br/>
file name regexp for matching and, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the<br/>
command prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in<br/>
that file instead of saving it in a temporary file.<br/>
<br/>
Noninteractively, if N-UP is nil, prompts for N-UP printing number.  If DIR is<br/>
nil, prompts for DIRectory.  If FILE-REGEXP is nil, prompts for<br/>
FILE(name)-REGEXP.  The argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it's nil,<br/>
save the image in a temporary file.  If FILENAME is a string, save the<br/>
PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is t, prompts for a<br/>
file name.<br/>
