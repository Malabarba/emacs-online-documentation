<strong>pr-ps-fast-fire</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>printing.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <print>.<br/>
<br/>
(pr-ps-fast-fire N-UP &optional SELECT)<br/>
<br/>
Fast fire function for PostScript printing.<br/>
<br/>
If a region is active, the region will be printed instead of the whole buffer.<br/>
Also if the current major-mode is defined in `pr-mode-alist', the settings in<br/>
`pr-mode-alist' will be used, that is, the current buffer or region will be<br/>
printed using `pr-ps-mode-ps-print'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, you have the following situations:<br/>
<br/>
   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET<br/>
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and printing will<br/>
      immediately be done using the current active printer.<br/>
<br/>
   C-u   M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET<br/>
   C-u 0 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET<br/>
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a current<br/>
      PostScript printer, then printing will immediately be done using the new<br/>
      current active printer.<br/>
<br/>
   C-u 1 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET<br/>
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a file name,<br/>
      and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the<br/>
      printer.<br/>
<br/>
   C-u 2 M-x pr-ps-fast-fire RET<br/>
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value, then for a current<br/>
      PostScript printer and, finally, for a file name.  Then change the active<br/>
      printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in<br/>
      that file instead of sending it to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Noninteractively, the argument N-UP should be a positive integer greater than<br/>
zero and the argument SELECT is treated as follows:<br/>
<br/>
   If it's nil, send the image to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
   If it's a list or an integer lesser or equal to zero, the command prompts<br/>
   the user for a current PostScript printer, then printing will immediately<br/>
   be done using the new current active printer.<br/>
<br/>
   If it's an integer equal to 1, the command prompts the user for a file name<br/>
   and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the<br/>
   printer.<br/>
<br/>
   If it's an integer greater or equal to 2, the command prompts the user for a<br/>
   current PostScript printer and for a file name.  Then change the active<br/>
   printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in that file<br/>
   instead of sending it to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-ps-printer-alist', it's the new<br/>
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active<br/>
   printer.<br/>
<br/>
   Otherwise, send the image to the printer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note that this command always behaves as if `pr-auto-region' and `pr-auto-mode'<br/>
are both set to t.
