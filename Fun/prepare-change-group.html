<strong>prepare-change-group</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(prepare-change-group &optional <u>BUFFER</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a handle for the current buffer's state, for a change group.</br>
If you specify <u>BUFFER</u>, make a handle for <u>BUFFER</u>'s state instead.</br>
</br>
Pass the handle to `activate-change-group' afterward to initiate</br>
the actual changes of the change group.</br>
</br>
To finish the change group, call either `accept-change-group' or</br>
`cancel-change-group' passing the same handle as argument.  Call</br>
`accept-change-group' to accept the changes in the group as final;</br>
call `cancel-change-group' to undo them all.  You should use</br>
`unwind-protect' to make sure the group is always finished.  The call</br>
to `activate-change-group' should be inside the `unwind-protect'.</br>
Once you finish the group, don't use the handle again--don't try to</br>
finish the same group twice.  For a simple example of correct use, see</br>
the source code of `atomic-change-group'.</br>
</br>
The handle records only the specified buffer.  To make a multibuffer</br>
change group, call this function once for each buffer you want to</br>
cover, then use `nconc' to combine the returned values, like this:</br>
</br>
  (nconc (prepare-change-group buffer-1)</br>
         (prepare-change-group buffer-2))</br>
</br>
You can then activate that multibuffer change group with a single</br>
call to `activate-change-group' and finish it with a single call</br>
to `accept-change-group' or `cancel-change-group'.
