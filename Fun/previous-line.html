previous-line is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-p, <up>.<br/><br/>(previous-line &optional ARG TRY-VSCROLL)<br/><br/>Move cursor vertically up ARG lines.<br/>Interactively, vscroll tall lines if `auto-window-vscroll' is enabled.<br/>If there is no character in the target line exactly over the current column,<br/>the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this<br/>column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.<br/><br/>If the variable `line-move-visual' is non-nil, this command moves<br/>by display lines.  Otherwise, it moves by buffer lines, without<br/>taking variable-width characters or continued lines into account.<br/><br/>The command C-x C-n can be used to create<br/>a semipermanent goal column for this command.<br/>Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),<br/>this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).<br/>The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil<br/>when there is no goal column.  Note that setting `goal-column'<br/>overrides `line-move-visual' and causes this command to move by buffer<br/>lines rather than by display lines.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider using<br/>`forward-line' with a negative argument instead.  It is usually easier<br/>to use and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).
