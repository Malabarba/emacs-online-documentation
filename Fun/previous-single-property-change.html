<strong>previous-single-property-change</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(previous-single-property-change POSITION PROP &optional OBJECT LIMIT)<br/>
<br/>
Return the position of previous property change for a specific property.<br/>
Scans characters backward from POSITION till it finds<br/>
a change in the PROP property, then returns the position of the change.<br/>
If the optional third argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means<br/>
the current buffer), POSITION is a buffer position (integer or marker).<br/>
If OBJECT is a string, POSITION is a 0-based index into it.<br/>
The property values are compared with `eq'.<br/>
Return nil if the property is constant all the way to the start of OBJECT.<br/>
If the value is non-nil, it is a position less than POSITION, never equal.<br/>
<br/>
If the optional fourth argument LIMIT is non-nil, don't search<br/>
back past position LIMIT; return LIMIT if nothing is found until LIMIT.
