<strong>previous-window</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(previous-window &optional WINDOW MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES)<br/>
<br/>
Return live window before WINDOW in the cyclic ordering of windows.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  The<br/>
optional arguments MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES specify the set of windows to<br/>
consider.<br/>
<br/>
MINIBUF nil or omitted means consider the minibuffer window only if the<br/>
minibuffer is active.  MINIBUF t means consider the minibuffer window<br/>
even if the minibuffer is not active.  Any other value means do not<br/>
consider the minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is active.<br/>
<br/>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame,<br/>
plus the minibuffer window if specified by the MINIBUF argument.  If the<br/>
minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all frames that share that<br/>
minibuffer too.  The following non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special<br/>
meanings:<br/>
<br/>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.<br/>
<br/>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames.<br/>
<br/>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and<br/>
  iconified frames.<br/>
<br/>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame and no<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
If you use consistent values for MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES, you can<br/>
use `previous-window' to iterate through the entire cycle of<br/>
acceptable windows, eventually ending up back at the window you<br/>
started with.  `next-window' traverses the same cycle, in the<br/>
reverse order.
