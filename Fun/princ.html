<strong>princ</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(princ <u>OBJECT</u> &optional <u>PRINTCHARFUN</u>)</br>
</br>
Output the printed representation of <u>OBJECT</u>, any Lisp object.</br>
No quoting characters are used; no delimiters are printed around</br>
the contents of strings.</br>
</br>
<u>OBJECT</u> is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,</br>
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.</br>
</br>
A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.</br>
</br>
Optional argument <u>PRINTCHARFUN</u> is the output stream, which can be one</br>
of these:</br>
</br>
   - a buffer, in which case output is inserted into that buffer at point;</br>
   - a marker, in which case output is inserted at marker's position;</br>
   - a function, in which case that function is called once for each</br>
     character of <u>OBJECT</u>'s printed representation;</br>
   - a symbol, in which case that symbol's function definition is called; or</br>
   - t, in which case the output is displayed in the echo area.</br>
</br>
If <u>PRINTCHARFUN</u> is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)</br>
is used instead.
