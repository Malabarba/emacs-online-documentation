Print a hard copy of the diary display.<br/>
<br/>
If the simple diary display is being used, prepare a temp buffer with the<br/>
visible lines of the diary buffer, add a heading line composed from the mode<br/>
line, print the temp buffer, and destroy it.<br/>
<br/>
If the fancy diary display is being used, just print the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
The hooks given by the variable `diary-print-entries-hook' are called to do<br/>
the actual printing.
