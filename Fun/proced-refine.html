proced-refine is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `proced.el'.<br/><br/>(proced-refine &optional EVENT)<br/><br/>Refine Proced listing by comparing with the attribute value at point.<br/>Optional EVENT is the location of the Proced field.<br/><br/>Refinement is controlled by the REFINER defined for each attribute ATTR<br/>in `proced-grammar-alist'.<br/><br/>If REFINER is a list of flags and point is on a process's value of ATTR,<br/>this command compares the value of ATTR of every process with the value<br/>of ATTR of the process at the position of point.<br/><br/>The predicate for the comparison of two ATTR values is defined<br/>in `proced-grammar-alist'.  For each return value of the predicate<br/>a refine flag is defined in `proced-grammar-alist'.  One can select<br/>processes for which the value of ATTR is "less than", "equal",<br/>and / or "larger" than ATTR of the process point is on.  A process<br/>is included in the new listing if the refine flag for the corresponding<br/>return value of the predicate is non-nil.<br/>The help-echo string for `proced-refine' uses "+" or "-" to indicate<br/>the current values of these refine flags.<br/><br/>If REFINER is a cons pair (FUNCTION . HELP-ECHO), FUNCTION is called<br/>with one argument, the PID of the process at the position of point.<br/>The function must return a list of PIDs that is used for the refined<br/>listing.  HELP-ECHO is a string that is shown when mouse is over this field.<br/><br/>This command refines an already existing process listing generated initially<br/>based on the value of the variable `proced-filter'.  It does not change<br/>this variable.  It does not revert the listing.  If you frequently need<br/>a certain refinement, consider defining a new filter in `proced-filter-alist'.
