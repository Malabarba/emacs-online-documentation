proced-send-signal is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `proced.el'.<br/><br/>(proced-send-signal &optional SIGNAL PROCESS-ALIST)<br/><br/>Send a SIGNAL to processes in PROCESS-ALIST.<br/>PROCESS-ALIST is an alist as returned by `proced-marked-processes'.<br/>Interactively, PROCESS-ALIST contains the marked processes.<br/>If no process is marked, it contains the process point is on,<br/>SIGNAL may be a string (HUP, INT, TERM, etc.) or a number.<br/>After sending SIGNAL to all processes in PROCESS-ALIST, this command<br/>runs the normal hook `proced-after-send-signal-hook'.<br/><br/>For backward compatibility SIGNAL and PROCESS-ALIST may be nil.<br/>Then PROCESS-ALIST contains the marked processes or the process point is on<br/>and SIGNAL is queried interactively.  This noninteractive usage is still<br/>supported but discouraged.  It will be removed in a future version of Emacs.
