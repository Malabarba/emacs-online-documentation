<strong>proced-toggle-tree</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>proced.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(proced-toggle-tree <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle the display of the process listing as process tree.</br>
With prefix <u>ARG</u>, display as process tree if <u>ARG</u> is positive, otherwise</br>
do not display as process tree.  Sets the variable `proced-tree-flag'.</br>
</br>
The process tree is generated from the selected processes in the</br>
Proced buffer (that is, the processes in `proced-process-alist').</br>
All processes that do not have a parent process in this list</br>
according to their ppid attribute become the root of a process tree.</br>
Each parent process is followed by its child processes.</br>
The process tree inherits the chosen sorting order of the process listing,</br>
that is, child processes of the same parent process are sorted using</br>
the selected sorting order.
