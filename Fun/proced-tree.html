<strong>proced-tree</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>proced.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(proced-tree PROCESS-ALIST)<br/>
<br/>
Rearrange PROCESS-ALIST as process tree.<br/>
If `proced-tree-flag' is non-nil, rearrange PROCESS-ALIST such that<br/>
every processes is followed by its child processes.  Each process<br/>
gets a tree attribute that specifies the depth of the process in the tree.<br/>
A root process is a process with no parent within PROCESS-ALIST according<br/>
to its value of the ppid attribute.  It has depth 0.<br/>
<br/>
If `proced-tree-flag' is nil, remove the tree attribute.<br/>
Return the rearranged process list.
