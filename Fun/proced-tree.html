<strong>proced-tree</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>proced.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(proced-tree <u>PROCESS-ALIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Rearrange <u>PROCESS-ALIST</u> as process tree.</br>
If `proced-tree-flag' is non-nil, rearrange <u>PROCESS-ALIST</u> such that</br>
every processes is followed by its child processes.  Each process</br>
gets a tree attribute that specifies the depth of the process in the tree.</br>
A root process is a process with no parent within <u>PROCESS-ALIST</u> according</br>
to its value of the ppid attribute.  It has depth 0.</br>
</br>
If `proced-tree-flag' is nil, remove the tree attribute.</br>
Return the rearranged process list.
