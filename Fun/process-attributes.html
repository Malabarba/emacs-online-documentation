</br>
(process-attributes <u>PID</u>)</br>
</br>
Return attributes of the process given by its <u>PID</u>, a number.</br>
</br>
Value is an alist where each element is a cons cell of the form</br>
</br>
    (KEY . VALUE)</br>
</br>
If this functionality is unsupported, the value is nil.</br>
</br>
See `list-system-processes' for getting a list of all process IDs.</br>
</br>
The KEYs of the attributes that this function may return are listed</br>
below, together with the type of the associated VALUE (in parentheses).</br>
Not all platforms support all of these attributes; unsupported</br>
attributes will not appear in the returned alist.</br>
Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, numbers can have either</br>
integer or floating point values.</br>

 pcpu    -- percents of CPU time used by the process (floating-point number)</br>
 pmem    -- percents of total physical memory used by process's resident set</br>
              (floating-point number)</br>
