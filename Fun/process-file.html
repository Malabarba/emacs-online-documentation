<strong>process-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(process-file <u>PROGRAM</u> &optional <u>INFILE</u> <u>BUFFER</u> <u>DISPLAY</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Process files synchronously in a separate process.</br>
Similar to `call-process', but may invoke a file handler based on</br>
`default-directory'.  The current working directory of the</br>
subprocess is `default-directory'.</br>
</br>
File names in <u>INFILE</u> and <u>BUFFER</u> are handled normally, but file</br>
names in <u>ARGS</u> should be relative to `default-directory', as they</br>
are passed to the process verbatim.  (This is a difference to</br>
`call-process' which does not support file handlers for <u>INFILE</u></br>
and <u>BUFFER</u>.)</br>
</br>
Some file handlers might not support all variants, for example</br>
they might behave as if <u>DISPLAY</u> was nil, regardless of the actual</br>
value passed.
