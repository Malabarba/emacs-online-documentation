<strong>process-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(process-file PROGRAM &optional INFILE BUFFER DISPLAY &rest ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Process files synchronously in a separate process.<br/>
Similar to `call-process', but may invoke a file handler based on<br/>
`default-directory'.  The current working directory of the<br/>
subprocess is `default-directory'.<br/>
<br/>
File names in INFILE and BUFFER are handled normally, but file<br/>
names in ARGS should be relative to `default-directory', as they<br/>
are passed to the process verbatim.  (This is a difference to<br/>
`call-process' which does not support file handlers for INFILE<br/>
and BUFFER.)<br/>
<br/>
Some file handlers might not support all variants, for example<br/>
they might behave as if DISPLAY was nil, regardless of the actual<br/>
value passed.
