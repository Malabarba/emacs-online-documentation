<br/>
(process-send-eof &optional PROCESS)<br/>
<br/>
Make PROCESS see end-of-file in its input.<br/>

PROCESS may be a process, a buffer, the name of a process or buffer, or<br/>
nil, indicating the current buffer's process.<br/>
If PROCESS is a network connection, or is a process communicating<br/>
through a pipe (as opposed to a pty), then you cannot send any more<br/>
text to PROCESS after you call this function.<br/>
If PROCESS is a serial process, wait until all output written to the<br/>
process has been transmitted to the serial port.
