<strong>progress-reporter-update</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(progress-reporter-update REPORTER &optional VALUE)<br/>
<br/>
Report progress of an operation in the echo area.<br/>
REPORTER should be the result of a call to `make-progress-reporter'.<br/>
<br/>
If REPORTER is a numerical progress reporter---i.e. if it was<br/>
 made using non-nil MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE arguments to<br/>
 `make-progress-reporter'---then VALUE should be a number between<br/>
 MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE.<br/>
<br/>
If REPORTER is a non-numerical reporter, VALUE should be nil.<br/>
<br/>
This function is relatively inexpensive.  If the change since<br/>
last update is too small or insufficient time has passed, it does<br/>
nothing.
