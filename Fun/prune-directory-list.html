<strong>prune-directory-list</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(prune-directory-list DIRS &optional KEEP REJECT)<br/>
<br/>
Return a copy of DIRS with all non-existent directories removed.<br/>
The optional argument KEEP is a list of directories to retain even if<br/>
they don't exist, and REJECT is a list of directories to remove from<br/>
DIRS, even if they exist; REJECT takes precedence over KEEP.<br/>
<br/>
Note that membership in REJECT and KEEP is checked using simple string<br/>
comparison.
