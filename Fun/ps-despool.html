<strong>ps-despool</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ps-despool &optional <u>FILENAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Send the spooled PostScript to the printer.</br>
</br>
Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the</br>
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file</br>
instead of sending it to the printer.</br>
</br>
Noninteractively, the argument <u>FILENAME</u> is treated as follows: if it is nil,</br>
send the image to the printer.  If <u>FILENAME</u> is a string, save the PostScript</br>
image in a file with that name.
