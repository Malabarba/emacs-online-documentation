<strong>ps-line-height</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ps-line-height FONT-SYM)<br/>
<br/>
The height of a line, for generating PostScript.<br/>
This is the value that ps-print uses to determine the height,<br/>
y-dimension, of the lines of text it has printed, and thus affects the<br/>
point at which page-breaks are placed.<br/>
The line-height is *not* the same as the point size of the font.
