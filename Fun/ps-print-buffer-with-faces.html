(ps-print-buffer-with-faces &optional FILENAME)<br/>
<br/>
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.<br/>
Like `ps-print-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in<br/>
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,<br/>
so it has a way to determine color values.
