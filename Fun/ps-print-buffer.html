ps-print-buffer is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `ps-print.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <menu-bar> <file> <ps-print-buffer>.<br/><br/>(ps-print-buffer &optional FILENAME)<br/><br/>Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.<br/><br/>Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the<br/>user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of<br/>sending it to the printer.<br/><br/>Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,<br/>send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript<br/>image in a file with that name.
