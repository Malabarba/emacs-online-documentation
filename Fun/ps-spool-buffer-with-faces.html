<strong>ps-spool-buffer-with-faces</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(ps-spool-buffer-with-faces)</br>
</br>
Generate and spool a PostScript image of the buffer.</br>
Like the command `ps-spool-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline</br>
information in the generated image.  This command works only if you are using</br>
a window system, so it has a way to determine color values.</br>
</br>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.
