<strong>ps-spool-buffer-with-faces</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ps-spool-buffer-with-faces)<br/>
<br/>
Generate and spool a PostScript image of the buffer.<br/>
Like `ps-spool-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in<br/>
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,<br/>
so it has a way to determine color values.<br/>
<br/>
Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.
