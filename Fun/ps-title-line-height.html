<strong>ps-title-line-height</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ps-title-line-height <u>FONT-SYM</u>)</br>
</br>
The height of a `title' line, for generating PostScript.</br>
This is the value that ps-print uses to determine the height,</br>
y-dimension, of the lines of text it has printed, and thus affects the</br>
point at which page-breaks are placed.</br>
The title-line-height is *not* the same as the point size of the font.
