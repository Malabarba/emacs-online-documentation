<strong>push</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(push NEWELT PLACE)<br/>
<br/>
Add NEWELT to the list stored in the generalized variable PLACE.<br/>
This is morally equivalent to (setf PLACE (cons NEWELT PLACE)),<br/>
except that PLACE is only evaluated once (after NEWELT).
