<strong>python-indent-shift-left</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>python.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(python-indent-shift-left START END &optional COUNT)<br/>
<br/>
Shift lines contained in region START END by COUNT columns to the left.<br/>
COUNT defaults to `python-indent-offset'.  If region isn't<br/>
active, the current line is shifted.  The shifted region includes<br/>
the lines in which START and END lie.  An error is signaled if<br/>
any lines in the region are indented less than COUNT columns.
