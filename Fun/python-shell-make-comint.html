<strong>python-shell-make-comint</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>python.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(python-shell-make-comint <u>CMD</u> <u>PROC-NAME</u> &optional <u>POP</u> <u>INTERNAL</u>)</br>
</br>
Create a Python shell comint buffer.</br>
<u>CMD</u> is the Python command to be executed and <u>PROC-NAME</u> is the</br>
process name the comint buffer will get.  After the comint buffer</br>
is created the `inferior-python-mode' is activated.  When</br>
optional argument <u>POP</u> is non-nil the buffer is shown.  When</br>
optional argument <u>INTERNAL</u> is non-nil this process is run on a</br>
buffer with a name that starts with a space, following the Emacs</br>
convention for temporary/internal buffers, and also makes sure</br>
the user is not queried for confirmation when the process is</br>
killed.
