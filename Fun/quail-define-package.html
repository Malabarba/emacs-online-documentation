quail-define-package is an autoloaded Lisp function in `quail.el'.<br/><br/>(quail-define-package NAME LANGUAGE TITLE &optional GUIDANCE DOCSTRING TRANSLATION-KEYS FORGET-LAST-SELECTION DETERMINISTIC KBD-TRANSLATE SHOW-LAYOUT CREATE-DECODE-MAP MAXIMUM-SHORTEST OVERLAY-PLIST UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION CONVERSION-KEYS SIMPLE)<br/><br/>Define NAME as a new Quail package for input LANGUAGE.<br/>TITLE is a string to be displayed at mode-line to indicate this package.<br/>Optional arguments are GUIDANCE, DOCSTRING, TRANSLATION-KEYS,<br/> FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,<br/> CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,<br/> UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.<br/><br/>GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.<br/>If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown<br/> with the currently selected translation being highlighted.<br/>If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character<br/> in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is<br/> shown.<br/>If it is nil, the current key is shown.<br/><br/>DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.  The command<br/>`describe-input-method' shows this string while replacing the form<br/>\<VAR> in the string by the value of VAR.  That value should be a<br/>string.  For instance, the form \<quail-translation-docstring> is<br/>replaced by a description about how to select a translation from a<br/>list of candidates.<br/><br/>TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation<br/>region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding<br/>command to be called.<br/><br/>FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept<br/>for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a<br/>translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the<br/>first candidate when the same key is entered later.<br/><br/>DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is<br/>selected automatically without allowing users to select another<br/>translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of<br/>no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other<br/>programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set<br/>to t.<br/><br/>KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a<br/>user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the<br/>documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and<br/>`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.<br/><br/>SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the `quail-help' command should show<br/>the user's keyboard layout visually with translated characters.<br/>If KBD-TRANSLATE is set, it is desirable to set also this flag unless<br/>this package defines no translations for single character keys.<br/><br/>CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode<br/>map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.<br/>Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some<br/>other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to<br/>convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII<br/>characters to represent Vietnamese characters.<br/><br/>MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum<br/>length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of<br/>key "..ABCD" but have translations of "..AB" and "CD..", break<br/>the key at "..AB" and start translation of "CD..".  Hangul<br/>packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we<br/>break the key just at "..ABC" and start translation of "D..".<br/><br/>OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which<br/>covers Quail translation region.<br/><br/>UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update<br/>the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By<br/>default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation<br/>for it) is inserted.<br/><br/>CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while<br/>conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character<br/>vs. corresponding command to be called.<br/><br/>If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of<br/>commands such as C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p and TAB; they are treated as<br/>non-Quail commands.
