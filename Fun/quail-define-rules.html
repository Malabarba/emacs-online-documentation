<strong>quail-define-rules</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>quail.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(quail-define-rules &rest RULES)<br/>
<br/>
Define translation rules of the current Quail package.<br/>
Each argument is a list of KEY and TRANSLATION.<br/>
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.<br/>
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map, or a function.<br/>
If it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.<br/>
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.<br/>
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate<br/>
  for the translation.<br/>
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.<br/>
<br/>
If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,<br/>
 it is used to handle KEY.<br/>
<br/>
The first argument may be an alist of annotations for the following<br/>
rules.  Each element has the form (ANNOTATION . VALUE), where<br/>
ANNOTATION is a symbol indicating the annotation type.  Currently<br/>
the following annotation types are supported.<br/>
<br/>
  append -- the value non-nil means that the following rules should<br/>
	be appended to the rules of the current Quail package.<br/>
<br/>
  face -- the value is a face to use for displaying TRANSLATIONs in<br/>
	candidate list.<br/>
<br/>
  advice -- the value is a function to call after one of RULES is<br/>
	selected.  The function is called with one argument, the<br/>
	selected TRANSLATION string, after the TRANSLATION is<br/>
	inserted.<br/>
<br/>
  no-decode-map --- the value non-nil means that decoding map is not<br/>
	generated for the following translations.
