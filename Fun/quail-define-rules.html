</br>
(quail-define-rules &rest <u>RULES</u>)</br>
</br>
Define translation rules of the current Quail package.</br>
Each argument is a list of KEY and TRANSLATION.</br>
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.</br>
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map, or a function.</br>
If it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.</br>
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.</br>
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate</br>
  for the translation.</br>
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.</br>
</br>
If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,</br>
 it is used to handle KEY.</br>
</br>
The first argument may be an alist of annotations for the following</br>
rules.  Each element has the form (ANNOTATION . VALUE), where</br>
ANNOTATION is a symbol indicating the annotation type.  Currently</br>
the following annotation types are supported.</br>
</br>
  append -- the value non-nil means that the following rules should</br>
	be appended to the rules of the current Quail package.</br>
</br>
  face -- the value is a face to use for displaying TRANSLATIONs in</br>
	candidate list.</br>
</br>
  advice -- the value is a function to call after one of <u>RULES</u> is</br>
	selected.  The function is called with one argument, the</br>
	selected TRANSLATION string, after the TRANSLATION is</br>
	inserted.</br>
</br>
  no-decode-map --- the value non-nil means that decoding map is not</br>
	generated for the following translations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
