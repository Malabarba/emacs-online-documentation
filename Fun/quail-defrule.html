quail-defrule is an autoloaded Lisp function in `quail.el'.<br/><br/>(quail-defrule KEY TRANSLATION &optional NAME APPEND)<br/><br/>Add one translation rule, KEY to TRANSLATION, in the current Quail package.<br/>KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.<br/>TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map,<br/> a function, or a cons.<br/>It it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.<br/>If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.<br/>If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate<br/> for the translation.<br/>If it is a cons, the car is one of the above and the cdr is a function<br/> to call when translating KEY (the return value is assigned to the<br/> variable `quail-current-data').  If the cdr part is not a function,<br/> the value itself is assigned to `quail-current-data'.<br/>In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.<br/><br/>If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,<br/> it is used to handle KEY.<br/><br/>Optional 3rd argument NAME, if specified, says which Quail package<br/>to define this translation rule in.  The default is to define it in the<br/>current Quail package.<br/><br/>Optional 4th argument APPEND, if non-nil, appends TRANSLATION<br/>to the current translations for KEY instead of replacing them.
