<strong>quail-set-keyboard-layout</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>quail.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(quail-set-keyboard-layout <u>KBD-TYPE</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the current keyboard layout to the same as keyboard <u>KBD-TYPE</u>.</br>
</br>
Since some Quail packages depends on a physical layout of keys (not</br>
characters generated by them), those are created by assuming the</br>
standard layout defined in `quail-keyboard-layout-standard'.  This</br>
function tells Quail system the layout of your keyboard so that what</br>
you type is correctly handled.
