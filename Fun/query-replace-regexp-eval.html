query-replace-regexp-eval is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `replace.el'.<br/><br/>(query-replace-regexp-eval REGEXP TO-EXPR &optional DELIMITED START END)<br/><br/>This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>use the `\,' feature of `query-replace-regexp'<br/>for interactive calls, and `search-forward-regexp'/`replace-match'<br/>for Lisp calls.<br/><br/>Replace some things after point matching REGEXP with the result of TO-EXPR.<br/><br/>Interactive use of this function is deprecated in favor of the<br/>`\,' feature of `query-replace-regexp'.  For non-interactive use, a loop<br/>using `search-forward-regexp' and `replace-match' is preferred.<br/><br/>As each match is found, the user must type a character saying<br/>what to do with it.  For directions, type C-h at that time.<br/><br/>TO-EXPR is a Lisp expression evaluated to compute each replacement.  It may<br/>reference `replace-count' to get the number of replacements already made.<br/>If the result of TO-EXPR is not a string, it is converted to one using<br/>`prin1-to-string' with the NOESCAPE argument (which see).<br/><br/>For convenience, when entering TO-EXPR interactively, you can use `\&' or<br/>`\0' to stand for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP, and `\N' (where<br/>N is a digit) to stand for whatever matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.<br/>Use `\#&' or `\#N' if you want a number instead of a string.<br/>In interactive use, `\#' in itself stands for `replace-count'.<br/><br/>In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents<br/>of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.<br/><br/>Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer<br/>that reads REGEXP.<br/><br/>Preserves case in each replacement if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'<br/>are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.<br/><br/>If `replace-regexp-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the regexp<br/>to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the<br/>regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.<br/><br/>Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace<br/>only matches that are surrounded by word boundaries.<br/>Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.
