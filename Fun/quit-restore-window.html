<strong>quit-restore-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(quit-restore-window &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>BURY-OR-KILL</u>)</br>
</br>
Quit <u>WINDOW</u> and deal with its buffer.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
</br>
According to information stored in <u>WINDOW</u>'s `quit-restore' window</br>
parameter either (1) delete <u>WINDOW</u> and its frame, (2) delete</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>, (3) restore the buffer previously displayed in <u>WINDOW</u>,</br>
or (4) make <u>WINDOW</u> display some other buffer than the present</br>
one.  If non-nil, reset `quit-restore' parameter to nil.</br>
</br>
Optional second argument <u>BURY-OR-KILL</u> tells how to proceed with</br>
the buffer of <u>WINDOW</u>.  The following values are handled:</br>
</br>
`nil' means to not handle the buffer in a particular way.  This</br>
  means that if <u>WINDOW</u> is not deleted by this function, invoking</br>
  `switch-to-prev-buffer' will usually show the buffer again.</br>
</br>
`append' means that if <u>WINDOW</u> is not deleted, move its buffer to</br>
  the end of <u>WINDOW</u>'s previous buffers so it's less likely that a</br>
  future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' will switch to it.</br>
  Also, move the buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.</br>
</br>
`bury' means that if <u>WINDOW</u> is not deleted, remove its buffer</br>
  from <u>WINDOW</u>'S list of previous buffers.  Also, move the buffer</br>
  to the end of the frame's buffer list.  This value provides the</br>
  most reliable remedy to not have `switch-to-prev-buffer' switch</br>
  to this buffer again without killing the buffer.</br>
</br>
`kill' means to kill <u>WINDOW</u>'s buffer.
