<strong>quit-restore-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(quit-restore-window &optional WINDOW BURY-OR-KILL)<br/>
<br/>
Quit WINDOW and deal with its buffer.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
<br/>
According to information stored in WINDOW's `quit-restore' window<br/>
parameter either (1) delete WINDOW and its frame, (2) delete<br/>
WINDOW, (3) restore the buffer previously displayed in WINDOW,<br/>
or (4) make WINDOW display some other buffer than the present<br/>
one.  If non-nil, reset `quit-restore' parameter to nil.<br/>
<br/>
Optional second argument BURY-OR-KILL tells how to proceed with<br/>
the buffer of WINDOW.  The following values are handled:<br/>
<br/>
`nil' means to not handle the buffer in a particular way.  This<br/>
  means that if WINDOW is not deleted by this function, invoking<br/>
  `switch-to-prev-buffer' will usually show the buffer again.<br/>
<br/>
`append' means that if WINDOW is not deleted, move its buffer to<br/>
  the end of WINDOW's previous buffers so it's less likely that a<br/>
  future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' will switch to it.<br/>
  Also, move the buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.<br/>
<br/>
`bury' means that if WINDOW is not deleted, remove its buffer<br/>
  from WINDOW'S list of previous buffers.  Also, move the buffer<br/>
  to the end of the frame's buffer list.  This value provides the<br/>
  most reliable remedy to not have `switch-to-prev-buffer' switch<br/>
  to this buffer again without killing the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
`kill' means to kill WINDOW's buffer.
