<strong>quote</strong> is a special form in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(quote <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the argument, without evaluating it.  `(quote x)' yields `x'.</br>
Warning: `quote' does not construct its return value, but just returns</br>
the value that was pre-constructed by the Lisp reader (see info node</br>
`(elisp)Printed Representation').</br>
This means that '(a . b) is not identical to (cons 'a 'b): the former</br>
does not cons.  Quoting should be reserved for constants that will</br>
never be modified by side-effects, unless you like self-modifying code.</br>
See the common pitfall in info node `(elisp)Rearrangement' for an example</br>
of unexpected results when a quoted object is modified.
