<strong>quoted-insert</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-q.</br>
</br>
<code>(quoted-insert <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Read next input character and insert it.</br>
This is useful for inserting control characters.</br>
With argument, insert <u>ARG</u> copies of the character.</br>
</br>
If the first character you type after this command is an octal digit,</br>
you should type a sequence of octal digits which specify a character code.</br>
Any nondigit terminates the sequence.  If the terminator is a RET,</br>
it is discarded; any other terminator is used itself as input.</br>
The variable `read-quoted-char-radix' specifies the radix for this feature;</br>
set it to 10 or 16 to use decimal or hex instead of octal.</br>
</br>
In overwrite mode, this function inserts the character anyway, and</br>
does not handle octal digits specially.  This means that if you use</br>
overwrite as your normal editing mode, you can use this function to</br>
insert characters when necessary.</br>
</br>
In binary overwrite mode, this function does overwrite, and octal</br>
digits are interpreted as a character code.  This is intended to be</br>
useful for editing binary files.
