quoted-printable-encode-region is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `qp.el'.<br/><br/>(quoted-printable-encode-region FROM TO &optional FOLD CLASS)<br/><br/>Quoted-printable encode the region between FROM and TO per RFC 2045.<br/><br/>If FOLD, fold long lines at 76 characters (as required by the RFC).<br/>If CLASS is non-nil, translate the characters not matched by that<br/>regexp class, which is in the form expected by `skip-chars-forward'.<br/>You should probably avoid non-ASCII characters in this arg.<br/><br/>If `mm-use-ultra-safe-encoding' is set, fold lines unconditionally and<br/>encode lines starting with "From".
