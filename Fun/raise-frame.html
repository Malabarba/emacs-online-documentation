<strong>raise-frame</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(raise-frame &optional FRAME)<br/>
<br/>
Bring FRAME to the front, so it occludes any frames it overlaps.<br/>
If FRAME is invisible or iconified, make it visible.<br/>
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.<br/>
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which<br/>
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function selects FRAME.
