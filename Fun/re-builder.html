Construct a regexp interactively.</br>
This command makes the current buffer the "target" buffer of</br>
the regexp builder.  It displays a buffer named "*RE-Builder*"</br>
in another window, initially containing an empty regexp.</br>
</br>
As you edit the regexp in the "*RE-Builder*" buffer, the</br>
matching parts of the target buffer will be highlighted.
