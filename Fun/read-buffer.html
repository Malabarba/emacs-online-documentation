<strong>read-buffer</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(read-buffer PROMPT &optional DEF REQUIRE-MATCH)<br/>
<br/>
Read the name of a buffer and return as a string.<br/>
Prompt with PROMPT.<br/>
Optional second arg DEF is value to return if user enters an empty line.<br/>
 If DEF is a list of default values, return its first element.<br/>
Optional third arg REQUIRE-MATCH determines whether non-existing<br/>
 buffer names are allowed.  It has the same meaning as the<br/>
 REQUIRE-MATCH argument of `completing-read'.<br/>
The argument PROMPT should be a string ending with a colon and a space.<br/>
If `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case' is non-nil, completion ignores<br/>
case while reading the buffer name.<br/>
If `read-buffer-function' is non-nil, this works by calling it as a<br/>
function, instead of the usual behavior.
