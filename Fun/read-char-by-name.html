<strong>read-char-by-name</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(read-char-by-name PROMPT)<br/>
<br/>
Read a character by its Unicode name or hex number string.<br/>
Display PROMPT and read a string that represents a character by its<br/>
Unicode property `name' or `old-name'.<br/>
<br/>
This function returns the character as a number.<br/>
<br/>
You can type a few of the first letters of the Unicode name and<br/>
use completion.  If you type a substring of the Unicode name<br/>
preceded by an asterisk `*' and use completion, it will show all<br/>
the characters whose names include that substring, not necessarily<br/>
at the beginning of the name.<br/>
<br/>
This function also accepts a hexadecimal number of Unicode code<br/>
point or a number in hash notation, e.g. #o21430 for octal,<br/>
#x2318 for hex, or #10r8984 for decimal.
