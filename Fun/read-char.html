<strong>read-char</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(read-char &optional <u>PROMPT</u> <u>INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD</u> <u>SECONDS</u>)</br>
</br>
Read a character from the command input (keyboard or macro).</br>
It is returned as a number.</br>
If the character has modifiers, they are resolved and reflected to the</br>
character code if possible (e.g. C-SPC -> 0).</br>
</br>
If the user generates an event which is not a character (i.e. a mouse</br>
click or function key event), `read-char' signals an error.  As an</br>
exception, switch-frame events are put off until non-character events</br>
can be read.</br>
If you want to read non-character events, or ignore them, call</br>
`read-event' or `read-char-exclusive' instead.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>PROMPT</u> is non-nil, display that as a prompt.</br>
If the optional argument <u>INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD</u> is non-nil and some</br>
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method</br>
is used for reading a character.</br>
If the optional argument <u>SECONDS</u> is non-nil, it should be a number</br>
specifying the maximum number of seconds to wait for input.  If no</br>
input arrives in that time, return nil.  <u>SECONDS</u> may be a</br>
floating-point value.
