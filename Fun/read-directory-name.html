<strong>read-directory-name</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(read-directory-name PROMPT &optional DIR DEFAULT-DIRNAME MUSTMATCH INITIAL)<br/>
<br/>
Read directory name, prompting with PROMPT and completing in directory DIR.<br/>
Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.<br/>
Default name to DEFAULT-DIRNAME if user exits with the same<br/>
non-empty string that was inserted by this function.<br/>
 (If DEFAULT-DIRNAME is omitted, DIR combined with INITIAL is used,<br/>
  or just DIR if INITIAL is nil.)<br/>
If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, this function returns<br/>
an empty string.  (This can only happen if the user erased the<br/>
pre-inserted contents or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)<br/>
Fourth arg MUSTMATCH non-nil means require existing directory's name.<br/>
 Non-nil and non-t means also require confirmation after completion.<br/>
Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.<br/>
DIR should be an absolute directory name.  It defaults to<br/>
the value of `default-directory'.
