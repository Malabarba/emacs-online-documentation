read-file-name is a compiled Lisp function in `minibuffer.el'.<br/><br/>(read-file-name PROMPT &optional DIR DEFAULT-FILENAME MUSTMATCH INITIAL PREDICATE)<br/><br/>Read file name, prompting with PROMPT and completing in directory DIR.<br/>Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.<br/><br/>DIR is the directory to use for completing relative file names.<br/>It should be an absolute directory name, or nil (which means the<br/>current buffer's value of `default-directory').<br/><br/>DEFAULT-FILENAME specifies the default file name to return if the<br/>user exits the minibuffer with the same non-empty string inserted<br/>by this function.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is a string, that serves<br/>as the default.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is a list of strings, the<br/>first string is the default.  If DEFAULT-FILENAME is omitted or<br/>nil, then if INITIAL is non-nil, the default is DIR combined with<br/>INITIAL; otherwise, if the current buffer is visiting a file,<br/>that file serves as the default; otherwise, the default is simply<br/>the string inserted into the minibuffer.<br/><br/>If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, return an empty<br/>string.  (This happens only if the user erases the pre-inserted<br/>contents, or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)<br/><br/>Fourth arg MUSTMATCH can take the following values:<br/>- nil means that the user can exit with any input.<br/>- t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless<br/>  the input is (or completes to) an existing file.<br/>- `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs<br/>  to confirm her choice if the input is not an existing file.<br/>- `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any<br/>  input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called<br/>  `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'<br/>  and the input is not an existing file.<br/>- anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it<br/>  does non-null completion.<br/><br/>Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.<br/><br/>Sixth arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, should be a function of one<br/>argument; then a file name is considered an acceptable completion<br/>alternative only if PREDICATE returns non-nil with the file name<br/>as its argument.<br/><br/>If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a graphical file<br/>dialog if `use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X<br/>toolkit in use provides a file dialog box, and DIR is not a<br/>remote file.  For graphical file dialogs, any of the special values<br/>of MUSTMATCH `confirm' and `confirm-after-completion' are<br/>treated as equivalent to nil.  Some graphical file dialogs respect<br/>a MUSTMATCH value of t, and some do not (or it only has a cosmetic<br/>effect, and does not actually prevent the user from entering a<br/>non-existent file).<br/><br/>See also `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case'<br/>and `read-file-name-function'.
