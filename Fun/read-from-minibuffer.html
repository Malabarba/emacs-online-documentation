<strong>read-from-minibuffer</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(read-from-minibuffer PROMPT &optional INITIAL-CONTENTS KEYMAP READ HIST DEFAULT-VALUE INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)<br/>
<br/>
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.<br/>
The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to<br/>
  DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when<br/>
  HIST is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.<br/>
<br/>
Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;<br/>
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.<br/>
<br/>
If fourth arg READ is non-nil, interpret the result as a Lisp object<br/>
  and return that object:<br/>
  in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'<br/>
<br/>
Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally<br/>
  the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the<br/>
  history list variable to use, or a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).<br/>
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and<br/>
  HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer history<br/>
  commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that element of<br/>
  the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions are counted<br/>
  starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE, if non-nil, should be a string, which is used<br/>
  as the default to `read' if READ is non-nil and the user enters<br/>
  empty input.  But if READ is nil, this function does _not_ return<br/>
  DEFAULT-VALUE for empty input!  Instead, it returns the empty string.<br/>
<br/>
  Whatever the value of READ, DEFAULT-VALUE is made available via the<br/>
  minibuffer history commands.  DEFAULT-VALUE can also be a list of<br/>
  strings, in which case all the strings are available in the history,<br/>
  and the first string is the default to `read' if READ is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits<br/>
 the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.<br/>
<br/>
If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,<br/>
 then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties<br/>
 were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.<br/>
<br/>
The remainder of this documentation string describes the<br/>
INITIAL-CONTENTS argument in more detail.  It is only relevant when<br/>
studying existing code, or when HIST is a cons.  If non-nil,<br/>
INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted into the minibuffer before<br/>
reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of that string.<br/>
However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING . POSITION), the initial<br/>
input is STRING, but point is placed at _one-indexed_ position<br/>
POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to<br/>
one puts point at the beginning of the string.  *Note* that this<br/>
behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in `completing-read'<br/>
and some related functions, which use zero-indexing for POSITION.
