<strong>read-from-minibuffer</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(read-from-minibuffer <u>PROMPT</u> &optional <u>INITIAL-CONTENTS</u> <u>KEYMAP</u> <u>READ</u> <u>HIST</u> <u>DEFAULT-VALUE</u> <u>INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD</u>)</br>
</br>
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string <u>PROMPT</u>.</br>
The optional second arg <u>INITIAL-CONTENTS</u> is an obsolete alternative to</br>
  <u>DEFAULT-VALUE</u>.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when</br>
  <u>HIST</u> is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.</br>
</br>
Third arg <u>KEYMAP</u> is a keymap to use whilst reading;</br>
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.</br>
</br>
If fourth arg <u>READ</u> is non-nil, interpret the result as a Lisp object</br>
  and return that object:</br>
  in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'</br>
</br>
Fifth arg <u>HIST</u>, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally</br>
  the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the</br>
  history list variable to use, or a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).</br>
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and</br>
  HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer history</br>
  commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that element of</br>
  the history as the value of <u>INITIAL-CONTENTS</u>.  Positions are counted</br>
  starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.</br>
</br>
Sixth arg <u>DEFAULT-VALUE</u>, if non-nil, should be a string, which is used</br>
  as the default to `read' if <u>READ</u> is non-nil and the user enters</br>
  empty input.  But if <u>READ</u> is nil, this function does _not_ return</br>
  <u>DEFAULT-VALUE</u> for empty input!  Instead, it returns the empty string.</br>
</br>
  Whatever the value of <u>READ</u>, <u>DEFAULT-VALUE</u> is made available via the</br>
  minibuffer history commands.  <u>DEFAULT-VALUE</u> can also be a list of</br>
  strings, in which case all the strings are available in the history,</br>
  and the first string is the default to `read' if <u>READ</u> is non-nil.</br>
</br>
Seventh arg <u>INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD</u>, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits</br>
 the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.</br>
</br>
If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,</br>
 then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties</br>
 were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.</br>
</br>
The remainder of this documentation string describes the</br>
<u>INITIAL-CONTENTS</u> argument in more detail.  It is only relevant when</br>
studying existing code, or when <u>HIST</u> is a cons.  If non-nil,</br>
<u>INITIAL-CONTENTS</u> is a string to be inserted into the minibuffer before</br>
reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of that string.</br>
However, if <u>INITIAL-CONTENTS</u> is (STRING . POSITION), the initial</br>
input is STRING, but point is placed at _one-indexed_ position</br>
POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to</br>
one puts point at the beginning of the string.  *Note* that this</br>
behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in `completing-read'</br>
and some related functions, which use zero-indexing for POSITION.
