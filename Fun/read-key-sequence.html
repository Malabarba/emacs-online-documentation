<strong>read-key-sequence</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(read-key-sequence PROMPT &optional CONTINUE-ECHO DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME CMD-LOOP)<br/>
<br/>
Read a sequence of keystrokes and return as a string or vector.<br/>
The sequence is sufficient to specify a non-prefix command in the<br/>
current local and global maps.<br/>
<br/>
First arg PROMPT is a prompt string.  If nil, do not prompt specially.<br/>
Second (optional) arg CONTINUE-ECHO, if non-nil, means this key echos<br/>
as a continuation of the previous key.<br/>
<br/>
The third (optional) arg DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST, if non-nil, means do not<br/>
convert the last event to lower case.  (Normally any upper case event<br/>
is converted to lower case if the original event is undefined and the lower<br/>
case equivalent is defined.)  A non-nil value is appropriate for reading<br/>
a key sequence to be defined.<br/>
<br/>
A C-g typed while in this function is treated like any other character,<br/>
and `quit-flag' is not set.<br/>
<br/>
If the key sequence starts with a mouse click, then the sequence is read<br/>
using the keymaps of the buffer of the window clicked in, not the buffer<br/>
of the selected window as normal.<br/>
<br/>
`read-key-sequence' drops unbound button-down events, since you normally<br/>
only care about the click or drag events which follow them.  If a drag<br/>
or multi-click event is unbound, but the corresponding click event would<br/>
be bound, `read-key-sequence' turns the event into a click event at the<br/>
drag's starting position.  This means that you don't have to distinguish<br/>
between click and drag, double, or triple events unless you want to.<br/>
<br/>
`read-key-sequence' prefixes mouse events on mode lines, the vertical<br/>
lines separating windows, and scroll bars with imaginary keys<br/>
`mode-line', `vertical-line', and `vertical-scroll-bar'.<br/>
<br/>
Optional fourth argument CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME non-nil means that this<br/>
function will process a switch-frame event if the user switches frames<br/>
before typing anything.  If the user switches frames in the middle of a<br/>
key sequence, or at the start of the sequence but CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME<br/>
is nil, then the event will be put off until after the current key sequence.<br/>
<br/>
`read-key-sequence' checks `function-key-map' for function key<br/>
sequences, where they wouldn't conflict with ordinary bindings.  See<br/>
`function-key-map' for more details.<br/>
<br/>
The optional fifth argument CMD-LOOP, if non-nil, means<br/>
that this key sequence is being read by something that will<br/>
read commands one after another.  It should be nil if the caller<br/>
will read just one key sequence.
