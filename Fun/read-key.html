read-key is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(read-key &optional PROMPT)<br/><br/>Read a key from the keyboard.<br/>Contrary to `read-event' this will not return a raw event but instead will<br/>obey the input decoding and translations usually done by `read-key-sequence'.<br/>So escape sequences and keyboard encoding are taken into account.<br/>When there's an ambiguity because the key looks like the prefix of<br/>some sort of escape sequence, the ambiguity is resolved via `read-key-delay'.
