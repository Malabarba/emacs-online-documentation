<strong>read-no-blanks-input</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(read-no-blanks-input PROMPT &optional INITIAL INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)<br/>
<br/>
Read a string from the terminal, not allowing blanks.<br/>
Prompt with PROMPT.  Whitespace terminates the input.  If INITIAL is<br/>
non-nil, it should be a string, which is used as initial input, with<br/>
point positioned at the end, so that SPACE will accept the input.<br/>
(Actually, INITIAL can also be a cons of a string and an integer.<br/>
Such values are treated as in `read-from-minibuffer', but are normally<br/>
not useful in this function.)<br/>
Third arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits<br/>
the current input method and the setting of`enable-multibyte-characters'.
