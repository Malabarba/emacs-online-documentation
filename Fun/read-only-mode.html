<strong>read-only-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x C-q.<br/>
<br/>
(read-only-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Change whether the current buffer is read-only.<br/>
With prefix argument ARG, make the buffer read-only if ARG is<br/>
positive, otherwise make it writable.  If buffer is read-only<br/>
and `view-read-only' is non-nil, enter view mode.<br/>
<br/>
Do not call this from a Lisp program unless you really intend to<br/>
do the same thing as the C-x C-q command, including<br/>
possibly enabling or disabling View mode.  Also, note that this<br/>
command works by setting the variable `buffer-read-only', which<br/>
does not affect read-only regions caused by text properties.  To<br/>
ignore read-only status in a Lisp program (whether due to text<br/>
properties or buffer state), bind `inhibit-read-only' temporarily<br/>
to a non-nil value.
