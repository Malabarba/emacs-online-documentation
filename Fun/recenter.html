recenter is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(recenter &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Center point in selected window and maybe redisplay frame.<br/>With prefix argument ARG, recenter putting point on screen line ARG<br/>relative to the selected window.  If ARG is negative, it counts up from the<br/>bottom of the window.  (ARG should be less than the height of the window.)<br/><br/>If ARG is omitted or nil, then recenter with point on the middle line of<br/>the selected window; if the variable `recenter-redisplay' is non-nil,<br/>also erase the entire frame and redraw it (when `auto-resize-tool-bars'<br/>is set to `grow-only', this resets the tool-bar's height to the minimum<br/>height needed); if `recenter-redisplay' has the special value `tty',<br/>then only tty frames are redrawn.<br/><br/>Just C-u as prefix means put point in the center of the window<br/>and redisplay normally--don't erase and redraw the frame.
