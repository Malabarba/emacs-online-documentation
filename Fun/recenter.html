<strong>recenter</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(recenter &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Center point in selected window and maybe redisplay frame.</br>
With a numeric prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, recenter putting point on screen line <u>ARG</u></br>
relative to the selected window.  If <u>ARG</u> is negative, it counts up from the</br>
bottom of the window.  (<u>ARG</u> should be less than the height of the window.)</br>
</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil, then recenter with point on the middle line of</br>
the selected window; if the variable `recenter-redisplay' is non-nil,</br>
also erase the entire frame and redraw it (when `auto-resize-tool-bars'</br>
is set to `grow-only', this resets the tool-bar's height to the minimum</br>
height needed); if `recenter-redisplay' has the special value `tty',</br>
then only tty frames are redrawn.</br>
</br>
Just C-u as prefix means put point in the center of the window</br>
and redisplay normally--don't erase and redraw the frame.
