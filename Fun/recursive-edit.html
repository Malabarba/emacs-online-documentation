<strong>recursive-edit</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(recursive-edit)</br>
</br>
Invoke the editor command loop recursively.</br>
To get out of the recursive edit, a command can throw to `exit' -- for</br>
instance `(throw 'exit nil)'.</br>
If you throw a value other than t, `recursive-edit' returns normally</br>
to the function that called it.  Throwing a t value causes</br>
`recursive-edit' to quit, so that control returns to the command loop</br>
one level up.</br>
</br>
This function is called by the editor initialization to begin editing.
