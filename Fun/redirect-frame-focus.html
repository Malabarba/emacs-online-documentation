</br>
(redirect-frame-focus <u>FRAME</u> &optional <u>FOCUS-FRAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Arrange for keystrokes typed at <u>FRAME</u> to be sent to <u>FOCUS-FRAME</u>.</br>
In other words, switch-frame events caused by events in <u>FRAME</u> will</br>
request a switch to <u>FOCUS-FRAME</u>, and `last-event-frame' will be</br>
<u>FOCUS-FRAME</u> after reading an event typed at <u>FRAME</u>.</br>
</br>
If <u>FOCUS-FRAME</u> is nil, any existing redirection is canceled, and the</br>
frame again receives its own keystrokes.</br>
</br>
Focus redirection is useful for temporarily redirecting keystrokes to</br>
a surrogate minibuffer frame when a frame doesn't have its own</br>
minibuffer window.</br>
</br>
A frame's focus redirection can be changed by `select-frame'.  If frame</br>
FOO is selected, and then a different frame BAR is selected, any</br>
frames redirecting their focus to FOO are shifted to redirect their</br>
focus to BAR.  This allows focus redirection to work properly when the</br>
user switches from one frame to another using `select-window'.</br>
</br>
This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated</br>
differently from a frame whose focus is redirected to nil; the former</br>
is affected by `select-frame', while the latter is not.</br>
</br>
The redirection lasts until `redirect-frame-focus' is called to change it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
