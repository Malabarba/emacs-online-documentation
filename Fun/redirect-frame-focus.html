<strong>redirect-frame-focus</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(redirect-frame-focus FRAME FOCUS-FRAME)<br/>
<br/>
Arrange for keystrokes typed at FRAME to be sent to FOCUS-FRAME.<br/>
In other words, switch-frame events caused by events in FRAME will<br/>
request a switch to FOCUS-FRAME, and `last-event-frame' will be<br/>
FOCUS-FRAME after reading an event typed at FRAME.<br/>
<br/>
If FOCUS-FRAME is nil, any existing redirection is canceled, and the<br/>
frame again receives its own keystrokes.<br/>
<br/>
Focus redirection is useful for temporarily redirecting keystrokes to<br/>
a surrogate minibuffer frame when a frame doesn't have its own<br/>
minibuffer window.<br/>
<br/>
A frame's focus redirection can be changed by `select-frame'.  If frame<br/>
FOO is selected, and then a different frame BAR is selected, any<br/>
frames redirecting their focus to FOO are shifted to redirect their<br/>
focus to BAR.  This allows focus redirection to work properly when the<br/>
user switches from one frame to another using `select-window'.<br/>
<br/>
This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated<br/>
differently from a frame whose focus is redirected to nil; the former<br/>
is affected by `select-frame', while the latter is not.<br/>
<br/>
The redirection lasts until `redirect-frame-focus' is called to change it.
