<strong>redisplay</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(redisplay &optional FORCE)<br/>
<br/>
Perform redisplay.<br/>
Optional arg FORCE, if non-nil, prevents redisplay from being<br/>
preempted by arriving input, even if `redisplay-dont-pause' is nil.<br/>
If `redisplay-dont-pause' is non-nil (the default), redisplay is never<br/>
preempted by arriving input, so FORCE does nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Return t if redisplay was performed, nil if redisplay was preempted<br/>
immediately by pending input.
