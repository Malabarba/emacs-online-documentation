(reftex-make-overlay BEG END &optional BUFFER FRONT-ADVANCE REAR-ADVANCE)<br/>
<br/>
Create a new overlay with range BEG to END in BUFFER.<br/>

BEG and END may be integers or markers.<br/>
The fourth arg FRONT-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the marker<br/>
for the front of the overlay advance when text is inserted there<br/>
(which means the text *is not* included in the overlay).<br/>
The fifth arg REAR-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the marker<br/>
for the rear of the overlay advance when text is inserted there<br/>
(which means the text *is* included in the overlay).
