reftex-query-index-phrase is a compiled Lisp function in `reftex-index.el'.<br/><br/>(reftex-query-index-phrase PHRASE MACRO-FMT &optional INDEX-KEY REPEAT AS-WORDS)<br/><br/>Search through buffer for PHRASE, and offer to replace it with an indexed<br/>version.  The index version is derived by applying `format' with MACRO-FMT<br/>to INDEX-KEY or PHRASE.  When REPEAT is non-nil, the PHRASE is inserted<br/>again after the macro.<br/>AS-WORDS means, the search for PHRASE should require word boundaries at<br/>both ends.
