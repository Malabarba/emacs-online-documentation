<strong>reftex-renumber-simple-labels</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>reftex-global.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(reftex-renumber-simple-labels)</br>
</br>
Renumber all simple labels in the document to make them sequentially.</br>
Simple labels are the ones created by RefTeX, consisting only of the</br>
prefix and a number.  After the command completes, all these labels will</br>
have sequential numbers throughout the document.  Any references to</br>
the labels will be changed as well.  For this, RefTeX looks at the</br>
arguments of any macros which either start or end in the string `ref'.</br>
This command should be used with care, in particular in multifile</br>
documents.  You should not use it if another document refers to this</br>
one with the `xr' package.
