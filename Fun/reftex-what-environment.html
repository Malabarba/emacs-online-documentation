</br>
(reftex-what-environment <u>WHICH</u> &optional <u>BOUND</u>)</br>
</br>
Find out if point is inside a LaTeX environment.</br>
The return value is (e.g.) either ("equation" . (point)) or a list of</br>
them.</br>
</br>
If <u>WHICH</u> is nil, immediately return nil.</br>
If <u>WHICH</u> is 1, return innermost enclosing environment.</br>
If <u>WHICH</u> is t, return list of all environments enclosing point.</br>
If <u>WHICH</u> is a list of environments, look only for those environments and</br>
  return the name of the first environment in this list found to enclose</br>
  point.</br>
</br>
If the optional <u>BOUND</u> is an integer, bound backwards directed searches to</br>
this point.  If it is nil, limit to nearest \section - like statement.
