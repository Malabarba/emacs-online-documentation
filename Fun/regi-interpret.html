regi-interpret is a compiled Lisp function in `regi.el'.<br/><br/>(regi-interpret FRAME &optional START END)<br/><br/>Interpret the regi frame FRAME.<br/>If optional START and END are supplied, they indicate the region of<br/>interest, and the buffer is narrowed to the beginning of the line<br/>containing START, and beginning of the line after the line containing<br/>END.  Otherwise, point and mark are not set and processing continues<br/>until your FUNC returns the `abort' symbol (see below).  Beware!  Not<br/>supplying a START or END could put you in an infinite loop.<br/><br/>A regi frame is a list of entries of the form:<br/><br/>     (PRED FUNC [NEGATE-P [CASE-FOLD-SEARCH]])<br/><br/>PRED is a predicate against which each line in the region is tested,<br/>and if a match occurs, FUNC is `eval'd.  Point is then moved to the<br/>beginning of the next line, the frame is reset and checking continues.<br/>If a match doesn't occur, the next entry is checked against the<br/>current line until all entries in the frame are checked.  At this<br/>point, if no match occurred, the frame is reset and point is moved to<br/>the next line.  Checking continues until every line in the region is<br/>checked.  Optional NEGATE-P inverts the result of PRED before FUNC is<br/>called and `case-fold-search' is bound to the optional value of<br/>CASE-FOLD-SEARCH for the PRED check.<br/><br/>PRED can be a string, variable, function or one of the following<br/>symbols: t, nil, `begin', `end', and `every'.  If PRED is a string, or<br/>a variable or list that evaluates to a string, it is interpreted as a<br/>regular expression and is matched against the current line (from the<br/>beginning) using `looking-at'.  If PRED does not evaluate to a string,<br/>it is interpreted as a binary value (nil or non-nil).<br/><br/>PRED can also be one of the following symbols:<br/><br/>t       -- always produces a true outcome<br/>`begin' -- always executes before anything else<br/>`end'   -- always executes after everything else<br/>`every' -- execute after frame is matched on a line<br/><br/>Note that NEGATE-P and CASE-FOLD-SEARCH are meaningless if PRED is one<br/>of these special symbols.  Only the first occurrence of each symbol in<br/>a frame entry is used, the rest are ignored.<br/><br/>Your FUNC can return values which control regi processing.  If a list<br/>is returned from your function, it can contain any combination of the<br/>following elements:<br/><br/>the symbol `continue'<br/>     Tells regi to continue processing frame-entries after a match,<br/>     instead of resetting to the first entry and advancing to the next<br/>     line, as is the default behavior.  When returning this symbol,<br/>     you must take care not to enter an infinite loop.<br/><br/>the symbol `abort'<br/>     Tells regi to terminate processing this frame.  any end<br/>     frame-entry is still processed.<br/><br/>the list `(frame . NEWFRAME)'<br/>     Tells regi to use NEWFRAME as its current frame.  In other words,<br/>     your FUNC can modify the executing regi frame on the fly.<br/><br/>the list `(step . STEP)'<br/>     Tells regi to move STEP number of lines forward during normal<br/>     processing.  By default, regi moves forward 1 line.  STEP can be<br/>     negative, but be careful of infinite loops.<br/><br/>You should usually take care to explicitly return nil from your<br/>function if no action is to take place.  Your FUNC will always be<br/>`eval'ed.  The following variables will be temporarily bound to some<br/>useful information:<br/><br/>`curline'<br/>     the current line in the buffer, as a string<br/><br/>`curframe'<br/>     the full, current frame being executed<br/><br/>`curentry'<br/>     the current frame entry being executed.
