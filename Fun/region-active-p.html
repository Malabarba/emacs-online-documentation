<strong>region-active-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(region-active-p)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active.<br/>
<br/>
Some commands act specially on the region when Transient Mark<br/>
mode is enabled.  Usually, such commands should use<br/>
`use-region-p' instead of this function, because `use-region-p'<br/>
also checks the value of `use-empty-active-region'.
