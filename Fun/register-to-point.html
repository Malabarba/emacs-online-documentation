</br>
(register-to-point <u>REGISTER</u> &optional <u>DELETE</u>)</br>
</br>
Move point to location stored in a register.</br>
If the register contains a file name, find that file.</br>
(To put a file name in a register, you must use `set-register'.)</br>
If the register contains a window configuration (one frame) or a frameset</br>
(all frames), restore that frame or all frames accordingly.</br>
First argument is a character, naming the register.</br>
Optional second arg non-nil (interactively, prefix argument) says to</br>
delete any existing frames that the frameset doesn't mention.</br>
(Otherwise, these frames are iconified.)</br>
</br>
Interactively, reads the register using `register-read-with-preview'.
