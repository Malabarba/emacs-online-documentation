<br/>
(register-to-point REGISTER &optional DELETE)<br/>
<br/>
Move point to location stored in a register.<br/>
If the register contains a file name, find that file.<br/>
(To put a file name in a register, you must use `set-register'.)<br/>
If the register contains a window configuration (one frame) or a frame<br/>
configuration (all frames), restore that frame or all frames accordingly.<br/>
First argument is a character, naming the register.<br/>
Optional second arg non-nil (interactively, prefix argument) says to<br/>
delete any existing frames that the frame configuration doesn't mention.<br/>
(Otherwise, these frames are iconified.)
