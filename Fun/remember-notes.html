<strong>remember-notes</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>remember.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(remember-notes &optional <u>SWITCH-TO</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the notes buffer, creating it if needed, and maybe switch to it.</br>
This buffer is for notes that you want to preserve across Emacs sessions.</br>
The notes are saved in `remember-data-file'.</br>
</br>
If a buffer is already visiting that file, just return it.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, create the buffer, and rename it to `remember-notes-buffer-name',</br>
unless a buffer of that name already exists.  Set the major mode according</br>
to `remember-notes-initial-major-mode', and enable `remember-notes-mode'</br>
minor mode.</br>
</br>
Use C-c C-c to save and bury the notes buffer.</br>
</br>
Interactively, or if <u>SWITCH-TO</u> is non-nil, switch to the buffer.</br>
Return the buffer.</br>
</br>
Set `initial-buffer-choice' to `remember-notes' to visit your notes buffer</br>
when Emacs starts.  Set `remember-notes-buffer-name' to "*scratch*"</br>
to turn the *scratch* buffer into your notes buffer.
