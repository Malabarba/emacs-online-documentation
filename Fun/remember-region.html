<strong>remember-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>remember.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(remember-region &optional <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Remember the data from <u>BEG</u> to <u>END</u>.</br>
It is called from within the *Remember* buffer to save the text</br>
that was entered.</br>
</br>
If <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> are nil, the entire buffer will be remembered.</br>

If you want to remember a region, supply a universal prefix to</br>
`remember' instead.  For example: C-u M-x remember RET.
