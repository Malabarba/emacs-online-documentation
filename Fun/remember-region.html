<strong>remember-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>remember.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(remember-region &optional BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Remember the data from BEG to END.<br/>
It is called from within the *Remember* buffer to save the text<br/>
that was entered.<br/>
<br/>
If BEG and END are nil, the entire buffer will be remembered.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to remember a region, supply a universal prefix to<br/>
`remember' instead.  For example: C-u M-x remember RET.
