remove-hook is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(remove-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional LOCAL)<br/><br/>Remove from the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.<br/>HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If<br/>FUNCTION isn't the value of HOOK, or, if FUNCTION doesn't appear in the<br/>list of hooks to run in HOOK, then nothing is done.  See `add-hook'.<br/><br/>The optional third argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify<br/>the hook's buffer-local value rather than its default value.
