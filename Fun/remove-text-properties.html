<strong>remove-text-properties</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(remove-text-properties START END PROPERTIES &optional OBJECT)<br/>
<br/>
Remove some properties from text from START to END.<br/>
The third argument PROPERTIES is a property list<br/>
whose property names specify the properties to remove.<br/>
(The values stored in PROPERTIES are ignored.)<br/>
If the optional fourth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means<br/>
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or<br/>
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.<br/>
Return t if any property was actually removed, nil otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Use `set-text-properties' if you want to remove all text properties.
