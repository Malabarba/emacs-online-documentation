<strong>rename-buffer</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(rename-buffer NEWNAME &optional UNIQUE)<br/>
<br/>
Change current buffer's name to NEWNAME (a string).<br/>
If second arg UNIQUE is nil or omitted, it is an error if a<br/>
buffer named NEWNAME already exists.<br/>
If UNIQUE is non-nil, come up with a new name using<br/>
`generate-new-buffer-name'.<br/>
Interactively, you can set UNIQUE with a prefix argument.<br/>
We return the name we actually gave the buffer.<br/>
This does not change the name of the visited file (if any).
