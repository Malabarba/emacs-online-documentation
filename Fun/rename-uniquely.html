<strong>rename-uniquely</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(rename-uniquely)</br>
</br>
Rename current buffer to a similar name not already taken.</br>
This function is useful for creating multiple shell process buffers</br>
or multiple mail buffers, etc.</br>
</br>
Note that some commands, in particular those based on `compilation-mode'</br>
(`compile', `grep', etc.) will reuse the current buffer if it has the</br>
appropriate mode even if it has been renamed.  So as well as renaming</br>
the buffer, you also need to switch buffers before running another</br>
instance of such commands.
