</br>
It is bound to &lt;again>, &lt;redo>, C-x M-:, C-x M-ESC.</br>
</br>
<code>(repeat-complex-command <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Edit and re-evaluate last complex command, or <u>ARG</u>th from last.</br>
A complex command is one which used the minibuffer.</br>
The command is placed in the minibuffer as a Lisp form for editing.</br>
The result is executed, repeating the command as changed.</br>
If the command has been changed or is not the most recent previous</br>
command it is added to the front of the command history.</br>
You can use the minibuffer history commands M-n and M-p</br>
to get different commands to edit and resubmit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
