Edit and re-evaluate last complex command, or ARGth from last.<br/>
A complex command is one which used the minibuffer.<br/>
The command is placed in the minibuffer as a Lisp form for editing.<br/>
The result is executed, repeating the command as changed.<br/>
If the command has been changed or is not the most recent previous<br/>
command it is added to the front of the command history.<br/>
You can use the minibuffer history commands M-n and M-p<br/>
to get different commands to edit and resubmit.
