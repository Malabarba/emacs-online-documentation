</br>
(repeat-is-really-this-command)</br>
</br>
Return t if this command is happening because user invoked `repeat'.</br>
Usually, when a command is executing, the Emacs builtin variable</br>
`this-command' identifies the command the user invoked.  Some commands modify</br>
that variable on the theory they're doing more good than harm; `repeat' does</br>
that, and usually does do more good than harm.  However, like all do-gooders,</br>
sometimes `repeat' gets surprising results from its altruism.  The value of</br>
this function is always whether the value of `this-command' would've been</br>
'repeat if `repeat' hadn't modified it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
