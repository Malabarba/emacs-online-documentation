<strong>repeat</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>repeat.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x z.</br>
</br>
<code>(repeat <u>REPEAT-ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Repeat most recently executed command.</br>
If <u>REPEAT-ARG</u> is non-nil (interactively, with a prefix argument),</br>
supply a prefix argument to that command.  Otherwise, give the</br>
command the same prefix argument it was given before, if any.</br>
</br>
If this command is invoked by a multi-character key sequence, it</br>
can then be repeated by repeating the final character of that</br>
sequence.  This behavior can be modified by the global variable</br>
`repeat-on-final-keystroke'.</br>
</br>
`repeat' ignores commands bound to input events.  Hence the term</br>
"most recently executed command" shall be read as "most</br>
recently executed command not bound to an input event".
