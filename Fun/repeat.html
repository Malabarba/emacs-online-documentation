repeat is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `repeat.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x z.<br/><br/>(repeat REPEAT-ARG)<br/><br/>Repeat most recently executed command.<br/>If REPEAT-ARG is non-nil (interactively, with a prefix argument),<br/>supply a prefix argument to that command.  Otherwise, give the<br/>command the same prefix argument it was given before, if any.<br/><br/>If this command is invoked by a multi-character key sequence, it<br/>can then be repeated by repeating the final character of that<br/>sequence.  This behavior can be modified by the global variable<br/>`repeat-on-final-keystroke'.<br/><br/>`repeat' ignores commands bound to input events.  Hence the term<br/>"most recently executed command" shall be read as "most<br/>recently executed command not bound to an input event".
