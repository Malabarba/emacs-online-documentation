replace-match-maybe-edit is a compiled Lisp function in `replace.el'.<br/><br/>(replace-match-maybe-edit NEWTEXT FIXEDCASE LITERAL NOEDIT MATCH-DATA)<br/><br/>Make a replacement with `replace-match', editing `\?'.<br/>NEWTEXT, FIXEDCASE, LITERAL are just passed on.  If NOEDIT is true, no<br/>check for `\?' is made to save time.  MATCH-DATA is used for the<br/>replacement.  In case editing is done, it is changed to use markers.<br/><br/>The return value is non-nil if there has been no `\?' or NOEDIT was<br/>passed in.  If LITERAL is set, no checking is done, anyway.
