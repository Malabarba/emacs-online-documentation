<strong>replace-match-maybe-edit</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(replace-match-maybe-edit <u>NEWTEXT</u> <u>FIXEDCASE</u> <u>LITERAL</u> <u>NOEDIT</u> <u>MATCH-DATA</u> <u>BACKWARD</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a replacement with `replace-match', editing `\?'.</br>
<u>FIXEDCASE</u>, <u>LITERAL</u> are passed to `replace-match' (which see).</br>
After possibly editing it (if `\?' is present), <u>NEWTEXT</u> is also</br>
passed to `replace-match'.  If <u>NOEDIT</u> is true, no check for `\?'</br>
is made (to save time).  <u>MATCH-DATA</u> is used for the replacement.</br>
In case editing is done, it is changed to use markers.</br>
</br>
The return value is non-nil if there has been no `\?' or <u>NOEDIT</u> was</br>
passed in.  If <u>LITERAL</u> is set, no checking is done, anyway.
