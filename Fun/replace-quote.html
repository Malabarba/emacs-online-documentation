<strong>replace-quote</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(replace-quote REPLACEMENT)<br/>
<br/>
Quote a replacement string.<br/>
This just doubles all backslashes in REPLACEMENT and<br/>
returns the resulting string.  If REPLACEMENT is not<br/>
a string, it is first passed through `prin1-to-string'<br/>
with the `noescape' argument set.<br/>
<br/>
`match-data' is preserved across the call.
