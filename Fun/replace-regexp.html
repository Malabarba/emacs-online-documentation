<strong>replace-regexp</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(replace-regexp REGEXP TO-STRING &optional DELIMITED START END)<br/>
<br/>
Replace things after point matching REGEXP with TO-STRING.<br/>
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'<br/>
are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.<br/>
<br/>
If `replace-regexp-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the regexp<br/>
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the<br/>
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.<br/>
<br/>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents<br/>
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace<br/>
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.<br/>
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.<br/>
<br/>
In TO-STRING, `\&' stands for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP,<br/>
and `\N' (where N is a digit) stands for<br/>
whatever what matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.<br/>
`\?' lets you edit the replacement text in the minibuffer<br/>
at the given position for each replacement.<br/>
<br/>
In interactive calls, the replacement text may contain `\,'<br/>
followed by a Lisp expression used as part of the replacement<br/>
text.  Inside of that expression, `\&' is a string denoting the<br/>
whole match, `\N' a partial match, `\#&' and `\#N' the respective<br/>
numeric values from `string-to-number', and `\#' itself for<br/>
`replace-count', the number of replacements occurred so far.<br/>
<br/>
If your Lisp expression is an identifier and the next letter in<br/>
the replacement string would be interpreted as part of it, you<br/>
can wrap it with an expression like `\,(or \#)'.  Incidentally,<br/>
for this particular case you may also enter `\#' in the<br/>
replacement text directly.<br/>
<br/>
When using those Lisp features interactively in the replacement<br/>
text, TO-STRING is actually made a list instead of a string.<br/>
Use C-x M-: after this command for details.<br/>
<br/>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search regexp to the minibuffer<br/>
that reads REGEXP.<br/>
<br/>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.<br/>
What you probably want is a loop like this:<br/>
  (while (re-search-forward REGEXP nil t)<br/>
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil nil))<br/>
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.
