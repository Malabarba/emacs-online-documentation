<strong>replace-string</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>replace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(replace-string FROM-STRING TO-STRING &optional DELIMITED START END)<br/>
<br/>
Replace occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.<br/>
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'<br/>
are non-nil and FROM-STRING has no uppercase letters.<br/>
(Preserving case means that if the string matched is all caps, or capitalized,<br/>
then its replacement is upcased or capitalized.)<br/>
<br/>
If `replace-lax-whitespace' is non-nil, a space or spaces in the string<br/>
to be replaced will match a sequence of whitespace chars defined by the<br/>
regexp in `search-whitespace-regexp'.<br/>
<br/>
In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents<br/>
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace<br/>
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.<br/>
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.<br/>
<br/>
Use M-n to pull the last incremental search string to the minibuffer<br/>
that reads FROM-STRING.<br/>
<br/>
This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.<br/>
What you probably want is a loop like this:<br/>
  (while (search-forward FROM-STRING nil t)<br/>
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil t))<br/>
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.<br/>
(You may need a more complex loop if FROM-STRING can match the null string<br/>
and TO-STRING is also null.)
