report-errors is a Lisp macro in `files.el'.<br/><br/>(report-errors FORMAT &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Eval BODY and turn any error into a FORMAT message.<br/>FORMAT can have a %s escape which will be replaced with the actual error.<br/>If `debug-on-error' is set, errors are not caught, so that you can<br/>debug them.<br/>Avoid using a large BODY since it is duplicated.
