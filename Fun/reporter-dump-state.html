<strong>reporter-dump-state</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>reporter.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(reporter-dump-state <u>PKGNAME</u> <u>VARLIST</u> <u>PRE-HOOKS</u> <u>POST-HOOKS</u>)</br>
</br>
Dump the state of the mode specific variables.</br>
<u>PKGNAME</u> contains the name of the mode as it will appear in the bug</br>
report (you must explicitly concat any version numbers).</br>
</br>
<u>VARLIST</u> is the list of variables to dump.  Each element in</br>
<u>VARLIST</u> can be a variable symbol, or a cons cell.  If a symbol,</br>
this will be passed to `reporter-dump-variable' for insertion</br>
into the mail buffer.  If a cons cell, the car must be a variable</br>
symbol and the cdr must be a function which will be `funcall'd</br>
with arguments the symbol and the mail buffer being composed.  Use</br>
this to write your own custom variable value printers for</br>
specific variables.</br>
</br>
Note that the global variable `reporter-eval-buffer' will be bound to</br>
the buffer in which `reporter-submit-bug-report' was invoked.  If you</br>
want to print the value of a buffer local variable, you should wrap</br>
the `eval' call in your custom printer inside a `set-buffer' (and</br>
probably a `save-excursion').  `reporter-dump-variable' handles this</br>
properly.</br>
</br>
<u>PRE-HOOKS</u> is run after the Emacs version and <u>PKGNAME</u> are inserted, but</br>
before the <u>VARLIST</u> is dumped.  <u>POST-HOOKS</u> is run after the <u>VARLIST</u> is</br>
dumped.
