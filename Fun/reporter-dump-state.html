<strong>reporter-dump-state</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>reporter.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(reporter-dump-state PKGNAME VARLIST PRE-HOOKS POST-HOOKS)<br/>
<br/>
Dump the state of the mode specific variables.<br/>
PKGNAME contains the name of the mode as it will appear in the bug<br/>
report (you must explicitly concat any version numbers).<br/>
<br/>
VARLIST is the list of variables to dump.  Each element in<br/>
VARLIST can be a variable symbol, or a cons cell.  If a symbol,<br/>
this will be passed to `reporter-dump-variable' for insertion<br/>
into the mail buffer.  If a cons cell, the car must be a variable<br/>
symbol and the cdr must be a function which will be `funcall'd<br/>
with arguments the symbol and the mail buffer being composed.  Use<br/>
this to write your own custom variable value printers for<br/>
specific variables.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the global variable `reporter-eval-buffer' will be bound to<br/>
the buffer in which `reporter-submit-bug-report' was invoked.  If you<br/>
want to print the value of a buffer local variable, you should wrap<br/>
the `eval' call in your custom printer inside a `set-buffer' (and<br/>
probably a `save-excursion').  `reporter-dump-variable' handles this<br/>
properly.<br/>
<br/>
PRE-HOOKS is run after the Emacs version and PKGNAME are inserted, but<br/>
before the VARLIST is dumped.  POST-HOOKS is run after the VARLIST is<br/>
dumped.
