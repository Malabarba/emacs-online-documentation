<strong>reposition-window</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>reposition.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-M-l.<br/>
<br/>
(reposition-window &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Make the current definition and/or comment visible.<br/>
Further invocations move it to the top of the window or toggle the<br/>
visibility of comments that precede it.<br/>
  Point is left unchanged unless prefix ARG is supplied.<br/>
  If the definition is fully onscreen, it is moved to the top of the<br/>
window.  If it is partly offscreen, the window is scrolled to get the<br/>
definition (or as much as will fit) onscreen, unless point is in a comment<br/>
which is also partly offscreen, in which case the scrolling attempts to get<br/>
as much of the comment onscreen as possible.<br/>
  Initially `reposition-window' attempts to make both the definition and<br/>
preceding comments visible.  Further invocations toggle the visibility of<br/>
the comment lines.<br/>
  If ARG is non-nil, point may move in order to make the whole defun<br/>
visible (if only part could otherwise be made so), to make the defun line<br/>
visible (if point is in code and it could not be made so, or if only<br/>
comments, including the first comment line, are visible), or to make the<br/>
first comment line visible (if point is in a comment).
