</br>
It is bound to C-M-l.</br>
</br>
<code>(reposition-window <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Make the current definition and/or comment visible.</br>
Further invocations move it to the top of the window or toggle the</br>
visibility of comments that precede it.</br>
  Point is left unchanged unless prefix <u>ARG</u> is supplied.</br>
  If the definition is fully onscreen, it is moved to the top of the</br>
window.  If it is partly offscreen, the window is scrolled to get the</br>
definition (or as much as will fit) onscreen, unless point is in a comment</br>
which is also partly offscreen, in which case the scrolling attempts to get</br>
as much of the comment onscreen as possible.</br>
  Initially `reposition-window' attempts to make both the definition and</br>
preceding comments visible.  Further invocations toggle the visibility of</br>
the comment lines.</br>
  If <u>ARG</u> is non-nil, point may move in order to make the whole defun</br>
visible (if only part could otherwise be made so), to make the defun line</br>
visible (if point is in code and it could not be made so, or if only</br>
comments, including the first comment line, are visible), or to make the</br>
first comment line visible (if point is in a comment).<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
