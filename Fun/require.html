<strong>require</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(require FEATURE &optional FILENAME NOERROR)<br/>
<br/>
If feature FEATURE is not loaded, load it from FILENAME.<br/>
If FEATURE is not a member of the list `features', then the feature<br/>
is not loaded; so load the file FILENAME.<br/>
If FILENAME is omitted, the printname of FEATURE is used as the file name,<br/>
and `load' will try to load this name appended with the suffix `.elc' or<br/>
`.el', in that order.  The name without appended suffix will not be used.<br/>
See `get-load-suffixes' for the complete list of suffixes.<br/>
If the optional third argument NOERROR is non-nil,<br/>
then return nil if the file is not found instead of signaling an error.<br/>
Normally the return value is FEATURE.<br/>
The normal messages at start and end of loading FILENAME are suppressed.
