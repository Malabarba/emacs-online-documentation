<strong>reset-this-command-lengths</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(reset-this-command-lengths)</br>
</br>
Make the unread events replace the last command and echo.</br>
Used in `universal-argument-other-key'.</br>
</br>
`universal-argument-other-key' rereads the event just typed.</br>
It then gets translated through `function-key-map'.</br>
The translated event has to replace the real events,</br>
both in the value of (this-command-keys) and in echoing.</br>
To achieve this, `universal-argument-other-key' calls</br>
`reset-this-command-lengths', which discards the record of reading</br>
these events the first time.
