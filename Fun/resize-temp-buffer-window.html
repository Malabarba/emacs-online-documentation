<strong>resize-temp-buffer-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>help.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(resize-temp-buffer-window &optional <u>WINDOW</u>)</br>
</br>
Resize <u>WINDOW</u> to fit its contents.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
Do not resize if <u>WINDOW</u> was not created by `display-buffer'.</br>
</br>
If <u>WINDOW</u> is part of a vertical combination, restrain its new</br>
size by `temp-buffer-max-height' and do not resize if its minimum</br>
accessible position is scrolled out of view.  If <u>WINDOW</u> is part</br>
of a horizontal combination, restrain its new size by</br>
`temp-buffer-max-width'.  In both cases, the value of the option</br>
`fit-window-to-buffer-horizontally' can inhibit resizing.</br>
</br>
If <u>WINDOW</u> is the root window of its frame, resize the frame</br>
provided `fit-frame-to-buffer' is non-nil.
