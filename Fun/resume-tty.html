<strong>resume-tty</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(resume-tty &optional TTY)<br/>
<br/>
Resume the previously suspended terminal device TTY.<br/>
The terminal is opened and reinitialized.  Frames that are on the<br/>
suspended terminal are revived.<br/>
<br/>
It is an error to resume a terminal while another terminal is active<br/>
on the same device.<br/>
<br/>
This function runs `resume-tty-functions' after resuming the terminal.<br/>
The functions are run with one arg, the id of the resumed terminal<br/>
device.<br/>
<br/>
`resume-tty' does nothing if it is called on a device that is not<br/>
suspended.<br/>
<br/>
TTY may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil (meaning the selected<br/>
frame's terminal).
