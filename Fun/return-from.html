return-from is an alias for `cl-return-from' in `cl.el'.<br/><br/>(return-from NAME &optional RESULT)<br/><br/>Return from the block named NAME.<br/>This jumps out to the innermost enclosing `(cl-block NAME ...)' form,<br/>returning RESULT from that form (or nil if RESULT is omitted).<br/>This is compatible with Common Lisp, but note that `defun' and<br/>`defmacro' do not create implicit blocks as they do in Common Lisp.
