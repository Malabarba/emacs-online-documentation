<strong>return-from</strong> is an alias for `cl-return-from' in `<code>cl.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(return-from NAME &optional RESULT)<br/>
<br/>
Return from the block named NAME.<br/>
This jumps out to the innermost enclosing `(cl-block NAME ...)' form,<br/>
returning RESULT from that form (or nil if RESULT is omitted).<br/>
This is compatible with Common Lisp, but note that `defun' and<br/>
`defmacro' do not create implicit blocks as they do in Common Lisp.
