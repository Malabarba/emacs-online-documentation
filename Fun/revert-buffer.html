<strong>revert-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;menu-bar> &lt;file> &lt;revert-buffer>.</br>
</br>
<code>(revert-buffer <em>&optional</em> <u>IGNORE-AUTO</u> <u>NOCONFIRM</u> <u>PRESERVE-MODES</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Replace current buffer text with the text of the visited file on disk.</br>
This undoes all changes since the file was visited or saved.</br>
With a prefix argument, offer to revert from latest auto-save file, if</br>
that is more recent than the visited file.</br>
</br>
This command also implements an interface for special buffers</br>
that contain text which doesn't come from a file, but reflects</br>
some other data instead (e.g. Dired buffers, `buffer-list'</br>
buffers).  This is done via the variable `revert-buffer-function'.</br>
In these cases, it should reconstruct the buffer contents from the</br>
appropriate data.</br>
</br>
When called from Lisp, the first argument is <u>IGNORE-AUTO</u>; only offer</br>
to revert from the auto-save file when this is nil.  Note that the</br>
sense of this argument is the reverse of the prefix argument, for the</br>
sake of backward compatibility.  <u>IGNORE-AUTO</u> is optional, defaulting</br>
to nil.</br>
</br>
Optional second argument <u>NOCONFIRM</u> means don't ask for confirmation</br>
at all.  (The variable `revert-without-query' offers another way to</br>
revert buffers without querying for confirmation.)</br>
</br>
Optional third argument <u>PRESERVE-MODES</u> non-nil means don't alter</br>
the files modes.  Normally we reinitialize them using `normal-mode'.</br>
</br>
This function binds `revert-buffer-in-progress-p' non-nil while it operates.</br>
</br>
This function calls the function that `revert-buffer-function' specifies</br>
to do the work, with arguments <u>IGNORE-AUTO</u> and <u>NOCONFIRM</u>.</br>
The default function runs the hooks `before-revert-hook' and</br>
`after-revert-hook'.
