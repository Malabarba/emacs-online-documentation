<strong>rgrep</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>grep.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(rgrep <u>REGEXP</u> &optional <u>FILES</u> <u>DIR</u> <u>CONFIRM</u>)</br>
</br>
Recursively grep for <u>REGEXP</u> in <u>FILES</u> in directory tree rooted at <u>DIR</u>.</br>
The search is limited to file names matching shell pattern <u>FILES</u>.</br>
<u>FILES</u> may use abbreviations defined in `grep-files-aliases', e.g.</br>
entering `ch' is equivalent to `*.[ch]'.</br>
</br>
With C-u prefix, you can edit the constructed shell command line</br>
before it is executed.</br>
With two C-u prefixes, directly edit and run `grep-find-command'.</br>
</br>
Collect output in a buffer.  While the recursive grep is running,</br>
you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error), or RET in the grep output buffer,</br>
to visit the lines where matches were found.  To kill the job</br>
before it finishes, type C-c C-k.</br>
</br>
This command shares argument histories with M-x lgrep and M-x grep-find.</br>
</br>
When called programmatically and <u>FILES</u> is nil, <u>REGEXP</u> is expected</br>
to specify a command to run.
