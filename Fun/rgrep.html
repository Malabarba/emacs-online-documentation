<strong>rgrep</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>grep.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(rgrep REGEXP &optional FILES DIR CONFIRM)<br/>
<br/>
Recursively grep for REGEXP in FILES in directory tree rooted at DIR.<br/>
The search is limited to file names matching shell pattern FILES.<br/>
FILES may use abbreviations defined in `grep-files-aliases', e.g.<br/>
entering `ch' is equivalent to `*.[ch]'.<br/>
<br/>
With C-u prefix, you can edit the constructed shell command line<br/>
before it is executed.<br/>
With two C-u prefixes, directly edit and run `grep-find-command'.<br/>
<br/>
Collect output in a buffer.  While the recursive grep is running,<br/>
you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error), or RET in the grep output buffer,<br/>
to visit the lines where matches were found.  To kill the job<br/>
before it finishes, type C-c C-k.<br/>
<br/>
This command shares argument histories with M-x lgrep and M-x grep-find.<br/>
<br/>
When called programmatically and FILES is nil, REGEXP is expected<br/>
to specify a command to run.
