<strong>right-char</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>bindings.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <right>.<br/>
<br/>
(right-char &optional N)<br/>
<br/>
Move point N characters to the right (to the left if N is negative).<br/>
On reaching beginning or end of buffer, stop and signal error.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the bidirectional context, this may move either forward<br/>
or backward in the buffer.  This is in contrast with C-f<br/>
and C-b, which see.
