right-word is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `bindings.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to <C-right>, <M-right>.<br/><br/>(right-word &optional N)<br/><br/>Move point N words to the right (to the left if N is negative).<br/><br/>Depending on the bidirectional context, this may move either forward<br/>or backward in the buffer.  This is in contrast with M-f<br/>and M-b, which see.<br/><br/>Value is normally t.<br/>If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there<br/>there and the function returns nil.  Field boundaries are not noticed<br/>if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.
