<strong>ring-insert+extend</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ring.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ring-insert+extend RING ITEM &optional GROW-P)<br/>
<br/>
Like `ring-insert', but if GROW-P is non-nil, then enlarge ring.<br/>
Insert onto ring RING the item ITEM, as the newest (last) item.<br/>
If the ring is full, behavior depends on GROW-P:<br/>
  If GROW-P is non-nil, enlarge the ring to accommodate the new item.<br/>
  If GROW-P is nil, dump the oldest item to make room for the new.
