<strong>rmail-encode-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>rmail.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(rmail-encode-string STRING MASK)<br/>
<br/>
Encode STRING with integer MASK, by taking the exclusive OR of the<br/>
lowest byte in the mask with the first character of string, the<br/>
second-lowest-byte with the second character of the string, etc.,<br/>
restarting at the lowest byte of the mask whenever it runs out.<br/>
Returns the encoded string.  Calling the function again with an<br/>
encoded string (and the same mask) will decode the string.
