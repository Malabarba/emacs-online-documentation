<strong>rmail-expunge</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>rmail.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(rmail-expunge &optional DONT-SHOW)<br/>
<br/>
Erase deleted messages from Rmail file and summary buffer.<br/>
This always shows a message (so as not to leave the Rmail buffer<br/>
unswapped), and always updates any summary (so that it remains<br/>
consistent with the Rmail buffer).  If DONT-SHOW is non-nil, it<br/>
does not pop any summary buffer.
