<strong>rmail</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>rmail.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(rmail &optional FILE-NAME-ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Read and edit incoming mail.<br/>
Moves messages into file named by `rmail-file-name' and edits that<br/>
file in RMAIL Mode.<br/>
Type C-h m once editing that file, for a list of RMAIL commands.<br/>
<br/>
May be called with file name as argument; then performs rmail editing on<br/>
that file, but does not copy any new mail into the file.<br/>
Interactively, if you supply a prefix argument, then you<br/>
have a chance to specify a file name with the minibuffer.<br/>
<br/>
If `rmail-display-summary' is non-nil, make a summary for this RMAIL file.
