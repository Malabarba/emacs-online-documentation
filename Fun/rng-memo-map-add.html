rng-memo-map-add is a compiled Lisp function in `rng-match.el'.<br/><br/>(rng-memo-map-add KEY VALUE MM &optional WEAKNESS)<br/><br/>Associate KEY with VALUE in memo-map MM and return the new memo-map.<br/>The new memo-map may or may not be a different object from MM.<br/><br/>Alists are better for small maps.  Hash tables are better for large<br/>maps.  A memo-map therefore starts off as an alist and switches to a<br/>hash table for large memo-maps.  A memo-map is always a list.  An empty<br/>memo-map is represented by nil.  A large memo-map is represented by a<br/>list containing just a hash-table.  A small memo map is represented by<br/>a list whose cdr is an alist and whose car is the number of entries in<br/>the alist.  The complete memo-map can be passed to `assoc' without<br/>problems: assoc ignores any members that are not cons cells.  There is<br/>therefore minimal overhead in successful lookups on small lists<br/>(which is the most common case).
