<strong>rng-xsd-compile</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>rng-xsd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(rng-xsd-compile <u>NAME</u> <u>PARAMS</u>)</br>
</br>
Provides W3C XML Schema as a RELAX NG datatypes library.</br>
<u>NAME</u> is a symbol giving the local name of the datatype.  <u>PARAMS</u> is a</br>
list of pairs (PARAM-NAME . PARAM-VALUE) where PARAM-NAME is a symbol</br>
giving the name of the parameter and PARAM-VALUE is a string giving</br>
its value.  If <u>NAME</u> or <u>PARAMS</u> are invalid, it calls rng-dt-error</br>
passing it arguments in the same style as format; the value from</br>
rng-dt-error will be returned.  Otherwise, it returns a list.  The</br>
first member of the list is t if any string is a legal value for the</br>
datatype and nil otherwise.  The second argument is a symbol; this</br>
symbol will be called as a function passing it a string followed by</br>
the remaining members of the list.  The function must return an object</br>
representing the value of the datatype that was represented by the</br>
string, or nil if the string is not a representation of any value.</br>
The object returned can be any convenient non-nil value, provided</br>
that, if two strings represent the same value, the returned objects</br>
must be equal.
