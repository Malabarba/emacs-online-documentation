<strong>round</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(round ARG &optional DIVISOR)<br/>
<br/>
Return the nearest integer to ARG.<br/>
With optional DIVISOR, return the nearest integer to ARG/DIVISOR.<br/>

Rounding a value equidistant between two integers may choose the<br/>
integer closer to zero, or it may prefer an even integer, depending on<br/>
your machine.  For example, (round 2.5) can return 3 on some<br/>
systems, but 2 on others.
