rst-indent-line is a compiled Lisp function in `rst.el'.<br/><br/>(rst-indent-line &optional DFLT)<br/><br/>Indent current line to next best reStructuredText tab.<br/>The next best tab is taken from the tab list returned by<br/>`rst-compute-tabs' which is used in a cyclic manner.  If the<br/>current indentation does not end on a tab use the first one.  If<br/>the current indentation is on a tab use the next tab.  This allows<br/>a repeated use of TAB to cycle through all<br/>possible tabs.  If no indentation is possible return `noindent' or<br/>use DFLT.  Return the indentation indented to.  When point is in<br/>indentation it ends up at its end.  Otherwise the point is kept<br/>relative to the content.
