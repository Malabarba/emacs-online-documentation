rst-insert-list is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `rst.el'.<br/><br/>(rst-insert-list &optional PREFER-ROMAN)<br/><br/>Insert a list item at the current point.<br/><br/>The command can insert a new list or a continuing list.  When it is called at a<br/>non-list line, it will promote to insert new list.  When it is called at a list<br/>line, it will insert a list with the same list style.<br/><br/>1. When inserting a new list:<br/><br/>User is asked to select the item style first, for example (a), i), +.  Use TAB<br/>for completion and choices.<br/><br/> (a) If user selects bullets or #, it's just added.<br/> (b) If user selects enumerations, a further prompt is given.  User needs to<br/>     input a starting item, for example 'e' for 'A)' style.<br/><br/>The position of the new list is arranged according to whether or not the<br/>current line and the previous line are blank lines.<br/><br/>2. When continuing a list, one thing need to be noticed:<br/><br/>List style alphabetical list, such as 'a.', and roman numerical list, such as<br/>'i.', have some overlapping items, for example 'v.' The function can deal with<br/>the problem elegantly in most situations.  But when those overlapped list are<br/>preceded by a blank line, it is hard to determine which type to use<br/>automatically.  The function uses alphabetical list by default.  If you want<br/>roman numerical list, just use a prefix to set PREFER-ROMAN.
