rst-re is a compiled Lisp function in `rst.el'.<br/><br/>(rst-re &rest ARGS)<br/><br/>Interpret ARGS as regular expressions and return a regex string.<br/>Each element of ARGS may be one of the following:<br/><br/>A string which is inserted unchanged.<br/><br/>A character which is resolved to a quoted regex.<br/><br/>A symbol which is resolved to a string using `rst-re-alist-def'.<br/><br/>A list with a keyword in the car.  Each element of the cdr of such<br/>a list is recursively interpreted as ARGS.  The results of this<br/>interpretation are concatenated according to the keyword.<br/><br/>For the keyword `:seq' the results are simply concatenated.<br/><br/>For the keyword `:shy' the results are concatenated and<br/>surrounded by a shy-group ("\(?:...\)").<br/><br/>For the keyword `:alt' the results form an alternative ("\|")<br/>which is shy-grouped ("\(?:...\)").<br/><br/>For the keyword `:grp' the results are concatenated and form a<br/>referenceable group ("\(...\)").<br/><br/>After interpretation of ARGS the results are concatenated as for<br/>`:seq'.
