rst-repeat-last-character is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `rst.el'.<br/><br/>(rst-repeat-last-character USE-NEXT)<br/><br/>Fill the current line using the last character on the current line.<br/>Fill up to the length of the preceding line or up to<br/>`fill-column' if preceding line is empty.<br/><br/>If USE-NEXT, use the next line rather than the preceding line.<br/><br/>If the current line is longer than the desired length, shave the characters off<br/>the current line to fit the desired length.<br/><br/>As an added convenience, if the command is repeated immediately, the alternative<br/>column is used (fill-column vs. end of previous/next line).
