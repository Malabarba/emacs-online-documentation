today, even if in the past); a string giving a relative time like<br/>
"2 hours 35 minutes" (the acceptable formats are those<br/>
recognized by `timer-duration'); nil meaning now; a number of<br/>
seconds from now; a value from `encode-time'; or t (with non-nil<br/>
REPEAT) meaning the next integral multiple of REPEAT.  REPEAT may<br/>
be an integer or floating point number.  The action is to call<br/>
