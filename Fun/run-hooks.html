<strong>run-hooks</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(run-hooks &rest <u>HOOKS</u>)</br>
</br>
Run each hook in <u>HOOKS</u>.</br>
Each argument should be a symbol, a hook variable.</br>
These symbols are processed in the order specified.</br>
If a hook symbol has a non-nil value, that value may be a function</br>
or a list of functions to be called to run the hook.</br>
If the value is a function, it is called with no arguments.</br>
If it is a list, the elements are called, in order, with no arguments.</br>
</br>
Major modes should not use this function directly to run their mode</br>
hook; they should use `run-mode-hooks' instead.</br>
</br>
Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.</br>
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.
