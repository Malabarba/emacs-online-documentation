<strong>run-mode-hooks</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(run-mode-hooks &rest <u>HOOKS</u>)</br>
</br>
Run mode hooks `delayed-mode-hooks' and <u>HOOKS</u>, or delay <u>HOOKS</u>.</br>
If the variable `delay-mode-hooks' is non-nil, does not run any hooks,</br>
just adds the <u>HOOKS</u> to the list `delayed-mode-hooks'.</br>
Otherwise, runs hooks in the sequence: `change-major-mode-after-body-hook',</br>
`delayed-mode-hooks' (in reverse order), <u>HOOKS</u>, and finally</br>
`after-change-major-mode-hook'.  Major mode functions should use</br>
this instead of `run-hooks' when running their FOO-mode-hook.
