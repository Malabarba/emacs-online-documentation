<strong>run-python-internal</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>python.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(run-python-internal)<br/>
<br/>
Run an inferior Internal Python process.<br/>
Input and output via buffer named after<br/>
`python-shell-internal-buffer-name' and what<br/>
`python-shell-internal-get-process-name' returns.<br/>
<br/>
This new kind of shell is intended to be used for generic<br/>
communication related to defined configurations, the main<br/>
difference with global or dedicated shells is that these ones are<br/>
attached to a configuration, not a buffer.  This means that can<br/>
be used for example to retrieve the sys.path and other stuff,<br/>
without messing with user shells.  Note that<br/>
`python-shell-enable-font-lock' and `inferior-python-mode-hook'<br/>
are set to nil for these shells, so setup codes are not sent at<br/>
startup.
