<strong>run-with-idle-timer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>timer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(run-with-idle-timer <u>SECS</u> <u>REPEAT</u> <u>FUNCTION</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Perform an action the next time Emacs is idle for <u>SECS</u> seconds.</br>
The action is to call <u>FUNCTION</u> with arguments <u>ARGS</u>.</br>
<u>SECS</u> may be an integer, a floating point number, or the internal</br>
time format returned by, e.g., `current-idle-time'.</br>
If Emacs is currently idle, and has been idle for N seconds (N &lt; <u>SECS</u>),</br>
then it will call <u>FUNCTION</u> in <u>SECS</u> - N seconds from now.  Using</br>
<u>SECS</u> &lt;= N is not recommended if this function is invoked from an idle</br>
timer, because <u>FUNCTION</u> will then be called immediately.</br>
</br>
If <u>REPEAT</u> is non-nil, do the action each time Emacs has been idle for</br>
exactly <u>SECS</u> seconds (that is, only once for each time Emacs becomes idle).</br>
</br>
This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.
