run-with-idle-timer is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `timer.el'.<br/><br/>(run-with-idle-timer SECS REPEAT FUNCTION &rest ARGS)<br/><br/>Perform an action the next time Emacs is idle for SECS seconds.<br/>The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.<br/>SECS may be an integer, a floating point number, or the internal<br/>time format returned by, e.g., `current-idle-time'.<br/>If Emacs is currently idle, and has been idle for N seconds (N < SECS),<br/>then it will call FUNCTION in SECS - N seconds from now.  Using<br/>SECS <= N is not recommended if this function is invoked from an idle<br/>timer, because FUNCTION will then be called immediately.<br/><br/>If REPEAT is non-nil, do the action each time Emacs has been idle for<br/>exactly SECS seconds (that is, only once for each time Emacs becomes idle).<br/><br/>This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.
