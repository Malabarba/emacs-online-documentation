</br>
It is bound to C-x C-s, &lt;menu-bar> &lt;file> &lt;save-buffer>.</br>
</br>
<code>(save-buffer <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Save current buffer in visited file if modified.</br>
Variations are described below.</br>
</br>
By default, makes the previous version into a backup file</br>
 if previously requested or if this is the first save.</br>
Prefixed with one C-u, marks this version</br>
 to become a backup when the next save is done.</br>
Prefixed with two C-u's,</br>
 unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.</br>
Prefixed with three C-u's, marks this version</br>
 to become a backup when the next save is done,</br>
 and unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.</br>
</br>
With a numeric prefix argument of 0, never make the previous version</br>
into a backup file.</br>
</br>
If a file's name is FOO, the names of its numbered backup versions are</br>
 FOO.~i~ for various integers i.  A non-numbered backup file is called FOO~.</br>
Numeric backups (rather than FOO~) will be made if value of</br>
 `version-control' is not the atom `never' and either there are already</br>
 numeric versions of the file being backed up, or `version-control' is</br>
 non-nil.</br>
We don't want excessive versions piling up, so there are variables</br>
 `kept-old-versions', which tells Emacs how many oldest versions to keep,</br>
 and `kept-new-versions', which tells how many newest versions to keep.</br>
 Defaults are 2 old versions and 2 new.</br>
`dired-kept-versions' controls dired's clean-directory (.) command.</br>
If `delete-old-versions' is nil, system will query user</br>
 before trimming versions.  Otherwise it does it silently.</br>
</br>
If `vc-make-backup-files' is nil, which is the default,</br>
 no backup files are made for files managed by version control.</br>
 (This is because the version control system itself records previous versions.)</br>
