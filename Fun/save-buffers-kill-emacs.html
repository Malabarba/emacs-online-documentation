<strong>save-buffers-kill-emacs</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(save-buffers-kill-emacs &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs process.<br/>
With prefix ARG, silently save all file-visiting buffers without asking.<br/>
If there are active processes where `process-query-on-exit-flag'<br/>
returns non-nil, asks whether processes should be killed.<br/>
Runs the members of `kill-emacs-query-functions' in turn and stops<br/>
if any returns nil.  If `confirm-kill-emacs' is non-nil, calls it.
