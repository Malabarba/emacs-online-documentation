<strong>save-excursion</strong> is a special form in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(save-excursion &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Save point, mark, and current buffer; execute <u>BODY</u>; restore those things.</br>
Executes <u>BODY</u> just like `progn'.</br>
The values of point, mark and the current buffer are restored</br>
even in case of abnormal exit (throw or error).</br>
The state of activation of the mark is also restored.</br>
</br>
This construct does not save `deactivate-mark', and therefore</br>
functions that change the buffer will still cause deactivation</br>
of the mark at the end of the command.  To prevent that, bind</br>
`deactivate-mark' with `let'.</br>
</br>
If you only want to save the current buffer but not point nor mark,</br>
then just use `save-current-buffer', or even `with-current-buffer'.
