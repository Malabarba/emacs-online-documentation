save-selected-window is a Lisp macro in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(save-selected-window &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Execute BODY, then select the previously selected window.<br/>The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.<br/><br/>This macro saves and restores the selected window, as well as the<br/>selected window in each frame.  If the previously selected window<br/>is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of<br/>BODY remains selected.  If the previously selected window of some<br/>frame is no longer live at the end of BODY, that frame's selected<br/>window is left alone.<br/><br/>This macro saves and restores the current buffer, since otherwise<br/>its normal operation could make a different buffer current.  The<br/>order of recently selected windows and the buffer list ordering<br/>are not altered by this macro (unless they are altered in BODY).
