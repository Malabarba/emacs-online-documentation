</br>
(save-selected-window &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute <u>BODY</u>, then select the previously selected window.</br>
The value returned is the value of the last form in <u>BODY</u>.</br>
</br>
This macro saves and restores the selected window, as well as the</br>
selected window in each frame.  If the previously selected window</br>
is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of</br>
<u>BODY</u> remains selected.  If the previously selected window of some</br>
frame is no longer live at the end of <u>BODY</u>, that frame's selected</br>
window is left alone.</br>
</br>
This macro saves and restores the current buffer, since otherwise</br>
its normal operation could make a different buffer current.  The</br>
order of recently selected windows and the buffer list ordering</br>
are not altered by this macro (unless they are altered in <u>BODY</u>).<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
