<strong>save-some-buffers</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x s.<br/>
<br/>
(save-some-buffers &optional ARG PRED)<br/>
<br/>
Save some modified file-visiting buffers.  Asks user about each one.<br/>
You can answer `y' to save, `n' not to save, `C-r' to look at the<br/>
buffer in question with `view-buffer' before deciding or `d' to<br/>
view the differences using `diff-buffer-with-file'.<br/>
<br/>
This command first saves any buffers where `buffer-save-without-query' is<br/>
non-nil, without asking.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument (the prefix) non-nil means save all with no questions.<br/>
Optional second argument PRED determines which buffers are considered:<br/>
If PRED is nil, all the file-visiting buffers are considered.<br/>
If PRED is t, then certain non-file buffers will also be considered.<br/>
If PRED is a zero-argument function, it indicates for each buffer whether<br/>
to consider it or not when called with that buffer current.<br/>
