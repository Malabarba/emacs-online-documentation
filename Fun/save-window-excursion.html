<strong>save-window-excursion</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(save-window-excursion &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute <u>BODY</u>, then restore previous window configuration.</br>
This macro saves the window configuration on the selected frame,</br>
executes <u>BODY</u>, then calls `set-window-configuration' to restore</br>
the saved window configuration.  The return value is the last</br>
form in <u>BODY</u>.  The window configuration is also restored if <u>BODY</u></br>
exits nonlocally.</br>
</br>
BEWARE: Most uses of this macro introduce bugs.</br>
E.g. it should not be used to try and prevent some code from opening</br>
a new window, since that window may sometimes appear in another frame,</br>
in which case `save-window-excursion' cannot help.
