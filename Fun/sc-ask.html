<strong>sc-ask</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>supercite.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(sc-ask <u>ALIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Ask a question in the minibuffer requiring a single character answer.</br>
This function is kind of an extension of `y-or-n-p' where a single</br>
letter is used to answer a question.  Question is formed from <u>ALIST</u></br>
which has members of the form:  (WORD . LETTER).  WORD is the long</br>
word form, while LETTER is the letter for selecting that answer.  The</br>
selected letter is returned, or nil if the question was not answered.</br>
Note that WORD is a string and LETTER is a character.  All LETTERs in</br>
the list should be unique.
