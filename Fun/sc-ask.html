</br>
(sc-ask <u>ALIST</u>)</br>
</br>
Ask a question in the minibuffer requiring a single character answer.</br>
This function is kind of an extension of `y-or-n-p' where a single</br>
letter is used to answer a question.  Question is formed from <u>ALIST</u></br>
which has members of the form:  (WORD . LETTER).  WORD is the long</br>
word form, while LETTER is the letter for selecting that answer.  The</br>
selected letter is returned, or nil if the question was not answered.</br>
Note that WORD is a string and LETTER is a character.  All LETTERs in</br>
the list should be unique.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
