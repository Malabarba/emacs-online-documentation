<strong>sc-set-variable</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>supercite.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sc-set-variable VAR)<br/>
<br/>
Set the Supercite VARIABLE.<br/>
This function mimics `set-variable', except that the variable to set<br/>
is determined non-interactively.  The value is queried for in the<br/>
minibuffer exactly the same way that `set-variable' does it.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the current value of the variable when the minibuffer is<br/>
querying you by typing `C-h'.  Note that the format is changed<br/>
slightly from that used by `set-variable' -- the current value is<br/>
printed just after the variable's name instead of at the bottom of the<br/>
help window.
