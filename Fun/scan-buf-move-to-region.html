<strong>scan-buf-move-to-region</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>help-at-pt.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(scan-buf-move-to-region PROP &optional ARG HOOK)<br/>
<br/>
Go to the start of the next region with non-nil PROP property.<br/>
Then run HOOK, which should be a quoted symbol that is a normal<br/>
hook variable, or an expression evaluating to such a symbol.<br/>
Adjacent areas with different non-nil PROP properties are<br/>
considered different regions.<br/>
<br/>
With numeric argument ARG, move to the start of the ARGth next<br/>
such region, then run HOOK.  If ARG is negative, move backward.<br/>
If point is already in a region, then that region does not count<br/>
toward ARG.  If ARG is 0 and point is inside a region, move to<br/>
the start of that region.  If ARG is 0 and point is not in a<br/>
region, print a message to that effect, but do not move point and<br/>
do not run HOOK.  If there are not enough regions to move over,<br/>
an error results and the number of available regions is mentioned<br/>
in the error message.  Point is not moved and HOOK is not run.
