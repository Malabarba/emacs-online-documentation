<strong>scan-buf-next-region</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>help-at-pt.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(scan-buf-next-region &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Go to the start of the next region with non-nil help-echo.<br/>
Print the help found there using `display-local-help'.  Adjacent<br/>
areas with different non-nil help-echo properties are considered<br/>
different regions.<br/>
<br/>
With numeric argument ARG, move to the start of the ARGth next<br/>
help-echo region.  If ARG is negative, move backward.  If point<br/>
is already in a help-echo region, then that region does not count<br/>
toward ARG.  If ARG is 0 and point is inside a help-echo region,<br/>
move to the start of that region.  If ARG is 0 and point is not<br/>
in such a region, just print a message to that effect.  If there<br/>
are not enough regions to move over, an error results and the<br/>
number of available regions is mentioned in the error message.<br/>
<br/>
A potentially confusing subtlety is that point can be in a<br/>
help-echo region without any local help being available.  This is<br/>
because `help-echo' can be a function evaluating to nil.  This<br/>
rarely happens in practice.
