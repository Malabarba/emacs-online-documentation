<strong>scroll-down-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <prior>, M-v.<br/>
<br/>
(scroll-down-command &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Scroll text of selected window down ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.<br/>
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-down' cannot<br/>
scroll window further, move cursor to the top line.<br/>
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.<br/>
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.<br/>
Negative ARG means scroll upward.<br/>
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll upward by nearly full screen.
