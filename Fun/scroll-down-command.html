<strong>scroll-down-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;prior>, M-v.</br>
</br>
<code>(scroll-down-command <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Scroll text of selected window down <u>ARG</u> lines; or near full screen if no <u>ARG</u>.</br>
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-down' cannot</br>
scroll window further, move cursor to the top line.</br>
When point is already on that position, then signal an error.</br>
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.</br>
Negative <u>ARG</u> means scroll upward.</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is the atom `-', scroll upward by nearly full screen.
