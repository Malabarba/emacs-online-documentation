<strong>scroll-lock-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>scroll-lock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(scroll-lock-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Buffer-local minor mode for pager-like scrolling.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable the mode if <u>ARG</u> is positive,</br>
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode</br>
if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.  When enabled, keys that normally move</br>
point by line or paragraph will scroll the buffer by the</br>
respective amount of lines instead and point will be kept</br>
vertically fixed relative to window boundaries during scrolling.
