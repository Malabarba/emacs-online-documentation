<strong>scroll-lock-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>scroll-lock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(scroll-lock-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Buffer-local minor mode for pager-like scrolling.<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,<br/>
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode<br/>
if ARG is omitted or nil.  When enabled, keys that normally move<br/>
point by line or paragraph will scroll the buffer by the<br/>
respective amount of lines instead and point will be kept<br/>
vertically fixed relative to window boundaries during scrolling.
