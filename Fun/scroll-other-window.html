<strong>scroll-other-window</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to &lt;M-next>, C-M-v, ESC &lt;next>.</br>
</br>
<code>(scroll-other-window <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Scroll next window upward <u>ARG</u> lines; or near full screen if no <u>ARG</u>.</br>
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.</br>
The next window is the one below the current one; or the one at the top</br>
if the current one is at the bottom.  Negative <u>ARG</u> means scroll downward.</br>
If <u>ARG</u> is the atom `-', scroll downward by nearly full screen.</br>
When calling from a program, supply as argument a number, nil, or `-'.</br>
</br>
If `other-window-scroll-buffer' is non-nil, scroll the window</br>
showing that buffer, popping the buffer up if necessary.</br>
If in the minibuffer, `minibuffer-scroll-window' if non-nil</br>
specifies the window to scroll.  This takes precedence over</br>
`other-window-scroll-buffer'.
