<code>(scroll-up-command <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Scroll text of selected window upward <u>ARG</u> lines; or near full screen if no <u>ARG</u>.</br>
If `scroll-error-top-bottom' is non-nil and `scroll-up' cannot</br>
scroll window further, move cursor to the bottom line.</br>
