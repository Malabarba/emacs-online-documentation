<strong>search-forward</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <find>.<br/>
<br/>
(search-forward STRING &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)<br/>
<br/>
Search forward from point for STRING.<br/>
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.<br/>
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.<br/>
The match found must not extend after that position.  A value of nil is<br/>
  equivalent to (point-max).<br/>
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).<br/>
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.<br/>
Optional fourth argument COUNT, if non-nil, means to search for COUNT<br/>
 successive occurrences.  If COUNT is negative, search backward,<br/>
 instead of forward, for -COUNT occurrences.<br/>
<br/>
Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable<br/>
`case-fold-search', which see.<br/>
