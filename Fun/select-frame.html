</br>
</br>
(select-frame <u>FRAME</u> &optional <u>NORECORD</u>)</br>
</br>
Select <u>FRAME</u>.</br>
Subsequent editing commands apply to its selected window.</br>
Optional argument <u>NORECORD</u> means to neither change the order of</br>
recently selected windows nor the buffer list.</br>
</br>
The selection of <u>FRAME</u> lasts until the next time the user does</br>
something to select a different frame, or until the next time</br>
this function is called.  If you are using a window system, the</br>
previously selected frame may be restored as the selected frame</br>
when returning to the command loop, because it still may have</br>
the window system's input focus.  On a text terminal, the next</br>
redisplay will display <u>FRAME</u>.</br>
</br>
This function returns <u>FRAME</u>, or nil if <u>FRAME</u> has been deleted.
