<strong>select-frame</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(select-frame FRAME &optional NORECORD)<br/>
<br/>
Select FRAME.<br/>
Subsequent editing commands apply to its selected window.<br/>
Optional argument NORECORD means to neither change the order of<br/>
recently selected windows nor the buffer list.<br/>
<br/>
The selection of FRAME lasts until the next time the user does<br/>
something to select a different frame, or until the next time<br/>
this function is called.  If you are using a window system, the<br/>
previously selected frame may be restored as the selected frame<br/>
when returning to the command loop, because it still may have<br/>
the window system's input focus.  On a text terminal, the next<br/>
redisplay will display FRAME.<br/>
<br/>
This function returns FRAME, or nil if FRAME has been deleted.
