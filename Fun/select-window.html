</br>
(select-window <u>WINDOW</u> &optional <u>NORECORD</u>)</br>
</br>
Select <u>WINDOW</u> which must be a live window.</br>
Also make <u>WINDOW</u>'s frame the selected frame and <u>WINDOW</u> that frame's</br>
selected window.  In addition, make <u>WINDOW</u>'s buffer current and set its</br>
buffer's value of `point' to the value of <u>WINDOW</u>'s `window-point'.</br>
Return <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
</br>
Optional second arg <u>NORECORD</u> non-nil means do not put this buffer at the</br>
front of the buffer list and do not make this window the most recently</br>
selected one.</br>
</br>
Run `buffer-list-update-hook' unless <u>NORECORD</u> is non-nil.  Note that</br>
applications and internal routines often select a window temporarily for</br>
various purposes; mostly, to simplify coding.  As a rule, such</br>
selections should be not recorded and therefore will not pollute</br>
`buffer-list-update-hook'.  Selections that "really count" are those</br>
causing a visible change in the next redisplay of <u>WINDOW</u>'s frame and</br>
should be always recorded.  So if you think of running a function each</br>
time a window gets selected put it on `buffer-list-update-hook'.</br>
</br>
Also note that the main editor command loop sets the current buffer to</br>
the buffer of the selected window before each command.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
