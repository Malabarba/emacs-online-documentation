<strong>self-insert-command</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to many ordinary text characters.</br>
</br>
<code>(self-insert-command <u>N</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Insert the character you type.</br>
Whichever character you type to run this command is inserted.</br>
The numeric prefix argument <u>N</u> says how many times to repeat the insertion.</br>
Before insertion, `expand-abbrev' is executed if the inserted character does</br>
not have word syntax and the previous character in the buffer does.</br>
After insertion, the value of `auto-fill-function' is called if the</br>
`auto-fill-chars' table has a non-nil value for the inserted character.</br>
At the end, it runs `post-self-insert-hook'.
