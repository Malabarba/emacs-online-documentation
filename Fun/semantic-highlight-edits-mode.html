<strong>semantic-highlight-edits-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>util-modes.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(semantic-highlight-edits-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Minor mode for highlighting changes made in a buffer.</br>
Changes are tracked by semantic so that the incremental parser can work</br>
properly.</br>
This mode will highlight those changes as they are made, and clear them</br>
when the incremental parser accounts for those edits.</br>
With prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The</br>
minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available and</br>
the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-nil if the</br>
minor mode is enabled.
