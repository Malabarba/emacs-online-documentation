semantic-idle-scheduler-mode is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `idle.el'.<br/><br/>(semantic-idle-scheduler-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Minor mode to auto parse buffer following a change.<br/>When this mode is off, a buffer is only rescanned for tokens when<br/>some command requests the list of available tokens.  When idle-scheduler<br/>is enabled, Emacs periodically checks to see if the buffer is out of<br/>date, and reparses while the user is idle (not typing.)<br/><br/>With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The<br/>minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available and<br/>the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-nil if the<br/>minor mode is enabled.
