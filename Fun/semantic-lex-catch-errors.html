<strong>semantic-lex-catch-errors</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>lex.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(semantic-lex-catch-errors SYMBOL &rest FORMS)<br/>
<br/>
Using SYMBOL, execute FORMS catching lexical errors.<br/>
If FORMS results in a call to the parser that throws a lexical error,<br/>
the error will be caught here without the buffer's cache being thrown<br/>
out of date.<br/>
If there is an error, the syntax that failed is returned.<br/>
If there is no error, then the last value of FORMS is returned.
