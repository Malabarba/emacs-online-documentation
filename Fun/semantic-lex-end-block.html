(semantic-lex-end-block SYNTAX)<br/>
<br/>
Process the end of a previously marked SYNTAX block.<br/>
That is, collapse the tokens inside that block, including the<br/>
beginning and end of block tokens, into a high level block token of<br/>
class SYNTAX.<br/>
The token at beginning of block is the one marked by a previous call<br/>
to `semantic-lex-start-block'.  The current token is the end of block.<br/>
The collapsed tokens are saved in `semantic-lex-block-streams'.
