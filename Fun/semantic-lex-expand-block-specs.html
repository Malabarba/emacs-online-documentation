<strong>semantic-lex-expand-block-specs</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>lex.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(semantic-lex-expand-block-specs SPECS)<br/>
<br/>
Expand block specifications SPECS into a Lisp form.<br/>
SPECS is a list of (BLOCK BEGIN END) elements where BLOCK, BEGIN, and<br/>
END are token class symbols that indicate to produce one collapsed<br/>
BLOCK token from tokens found between BEGIN and END ones.<br/>
BLOCK must be a non-nil symbol, and at least one of the BEGIN or END<br/>
symbols must be non-nil too.<br/>
When BEGIN is non-nil, generate a call to `semantic-lex-start-block'<br/>
when a BEGIN token class is encountered.<br/>
When END is non-nil, generate a call to `semantic-lex-end-block' when<br/>
an END token class is encountered.
