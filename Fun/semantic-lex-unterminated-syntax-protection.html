<strong>semantic-lex-unterminated-syntax-protection</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>lex.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(semantic-lex-unterminated-syntax-protection SYNTAX &rest FORMS)<br/>
<br/>
For SYNTAX, execute FORMS with protection for unterminated syntax.<br/>
If FORMS throws an error, treat this as a syntax problem, and<br/>
execute the unterminated syntax code.  FORMS should return a position.<br/>
Irregardless of an error, the cursor should be moved to the end of<br/>
the desired syntax, and a position returned.<br/>
If `debug-on-error' is set, errors are not caught, so that you can<br/>
debug them.<br/>
Avoid using a large FORMS since it is duplicated.
