(semantic-overlay-lists)</br>
</br>
Return a pair of lists giving all the overlays of the current buffer.</br>
The car has all the overlays before the overlay center;</br>
the cdr has all the overlays after the overlay center.</br>
Recentering overlays moves overlays between these lists.</br>
The lists you get are copies, so that changing them has no effect.</br>
However, the overlays you get are the real objects that the buffer uses.
