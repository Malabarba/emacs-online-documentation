<strong>semantic-parse-region</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>semantic.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(semantic-parse-region START END &optional NONTERMINAL DEPTH RETURNONERROR)<br/>
<br/>
Parse the area between START and END, and return any tags found.<br/>
If END needs to be extended due to a lexical token being too large, it<br/>
will be silently ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Optional arguments:<br/>
NONTERMINAL is the rule to start parsing at.<br/>
DEPTH specifies the lexical depth to descend for parsers that use<br/>
lexical analysis as their first step.<br/>
RETURNONERROR specifies that parsing should stop on the first<br/>
unmatched syntax encountered.  When nil, parsing skips the syntax,<br/>
adding it to the unmatched syntax cache.<br/>
<br/>
Must return a list of semantic tags which have been cooked<br/>
(repositioned properly) but which DO NOT HAVE OVERLAYS associated<br/>
with them.  When overloading this function, use `semantic--tag-expand'<br/>
to cook raw tags.
