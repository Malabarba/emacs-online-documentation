semantic-run-mode-hooks is an alias for `run-mode-hooks' in `fw.el'.<br/><br/>(semantic-run-mode-hooks &rest HOOKS)<br/><br/>Run mode hooks `delayed-mode-hooks' and HOOKS, or delay HOOKS.<br/>If the variable `delay-mode-hooks' is non-nil, does not run any hooks,<br/>just adds the HOOKS to the list `delayed-mode-hooks'.<br/>Otherwise, runs hooks in the sequence: `change-major-mode-after-body-hook',<br/>`delayed-mode-hooks' (in reverse order), HOOKS, and finally<br/>`after-change-major-mode-hook'.  Major mode functions should use<br/>this instead of `run-hooks' when running their FOO-mode-hook.
