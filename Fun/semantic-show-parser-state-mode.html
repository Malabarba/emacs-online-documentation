semantic-show-parser-state-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `util-modes.el'.<br/><br/>(semantic-show-parser-state-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Minor mode for displaying parser cache state in the modeline.<br/>The cache can be in one of three states.  They are<br/>Up to date, Partial reparse needed, and Full reparse needed.<br/>The state is indicated in the modeline with the following characters:<br/> `-'  ->  The cache is up to date.<br/> `!'  ->  The cache requires a full update.<br/> `~'  ->  The cache needs to be incrementally parsed.<br/> `%'  ->  The cache is not currently parsable.<br/> `@'  ->  Auto-parse in progress (not set here.)<br/>With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The<br/>minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available and<br/>the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-nil if the<br/>minor mode is enabled.
