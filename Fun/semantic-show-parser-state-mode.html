<strong>semantic-show-parser-state-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>util-modes.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(semantic-show-parser-state-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Minor mode for displaying parser cache state in the modeline.</br>
The cache can be in one of three states.  They are</br>
Up to date, Partial reparse needed, and Full reparse needed.</br>
The state is indicated in the modeline with the following characters:</br>
 `-'  ->  The cache is up to date.</br>
 `!'  ->  The cache requires a full update.</br>
 `~'  ->  The cache needs to be incrementally parsed.</br>
 `%'  ->  The cache is not currently parsable.</br>
 `@'  ->  Auto-parse in progress (not set here.)</br>
With prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, turn on if positive, otherwise off.  The</br>
minor mode can be turned on only if semantic feature is available and</br>
the current buffer was set up for parsing.  Return non-nil if the</br>
minor mode is enabled.
