<strong>semanticdb-find-translate-path</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>db-find.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(semanticdb-find-translate-path <u>PATH</u> <u>BRUTISH</u>)</br>
</br>
Translate <u>PATH</u> into a list of semantic tables.</br>
Path translation involves identifying the <u>PATH</u> input argument</br>
in one of the following ways:</br>
  nil - Take the current buffer, and use its include list</br>
  buffer - Use that buffer's include list.</br>
  filename - Use that file's include list.  If the file is not</br>
      in a buffer, see of there is a semanticdb table for it.  If</br>
      not, read that file into a buffer.</br>
  tag - Get that tag's buffer of file file.  See above.</br>
  table - Search that table, and its include list.</br>
  find result - Search the results of a previous find.</br>
</br>
In addition, once the base path is found, there is the possibility of</br>
each added table adding yet more tables to the path, so this routine</br>
can return a lengthy list.</br>
</br>
If argument <u>BRUTISH</u> is non-nil, then instead of using the include</br>
list, use all tables found in the parent project of the table</br>
identified by translating <u>PATH</u>.  Such searches use brute force to</br>
scan every available table.</br>
</br>
The return value is a list of objects of type `semanticdb-table' or</br>
their children.  In the case of passing in a find result, the result</br>
is returned unchanged.</br>
</br>
This routine uses `semanticdb-find-table-for-include' to translate</br>
specific include tags into a semanticdb table.</br>
</br>
Note: When searching using a non-brutish method, the list of</br>
included files will be cached between runs.  Database-references</br>
are used to track which files need to have their include lists</br>
refreshed when things change.  See `semanticdb-ref-test'.</br>
</br>
Note for overloading:  If you opt to overload this function for your</br>
major mode, and your routine takes a long time, be sure to call</br>
</br>
 (semantic-throw-on-input 'your-symbol-here)</br>
</br>
so that it can be called from the idle work handler.
