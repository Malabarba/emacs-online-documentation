<strong>semanticdb-strip-find-results</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>db-find.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(semanticdb-strip-find-results RESULTS &optional FIND-FILE-MATCH)<br/>
<br/>
Strip a semanticdb search RESULTS to exclude objects.<br/>
This makes it appear more like the results of a `semantic-find-' call.<br/>
Optional FIND-FILE-MATCH loads all files associated with RESULTS<br/>
into buffers.  This has the side effect of enabling `semantic-tag-buffer' to<br/>
return a value.<br/>
If FIND-FILE-MATCH is 'name, then only the filename is stored<br/>
in each tag instead of loading each file into a buffer.<br/>
If the input RESULTS are not going to be used again, and if<br/>
FIND-FILE-MATCH is nil, you can use `semanticdb-fast-strip-find-results'<br/>
instead.
