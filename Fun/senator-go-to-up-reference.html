</br>
</br>
(senator-go-to-up-reference &optional <u>TAG</u>)</br>
</br>
Move up one reference from the current <u>TAG</u>.</br>
A "reference" could be any interesting feature of <u>TAG</u>.</br>
In C++, a function may have a 'parent' which is non-local.</br>
If that parent which is only a reference in the function tag</br>
is found, we can jump to it.</br>
Some tags such as includes have other reference features.
