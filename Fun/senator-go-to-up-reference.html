<br/>
(senator-go-to-up-reference &optional TAG)<br/>
<br/>
Move up one reference from the current TAG.<br/>
A "reference" could be any interesting feature of TAG.<br/>
In C++, a function may have a 'parent' which is non-local.<br/>
If that parent which is only a reference in the function tag<br/>
is found, we can jump to it.<br/>
Some tags such as includes have other reference features.
