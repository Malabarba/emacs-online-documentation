<strong>sentence-end</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>paragraphs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sentence-end)<br/>
<br/>
Return the regexp describing the end of a sentence.<br/>
<br/>
This function returns either the value of the variable `sentence-end'<br/>
if it is non-nil, or the default value constructed from the<br/>
variables `sentence-end-base', `sentence-end-double-space',<br/>
`sentence-end-without-period' and `sentence-end-without-space'.<br/>
<br/>
The default value specifies that in order to be recognized as the<br/>
end of a sentence, the ending period, question mark, or exclamation point<br/>
must be followed by two spaces, with perhaps some closing delimiters<br/>
in between.  See Info node `(elisp)Standard Regexps'.
