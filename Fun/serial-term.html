<strong>serial-term</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>term.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(serial-term PORT SPEED)<br/>
<br/>
Start a terminal-emulator for a serial port in a new buffer.<br/>
PORT is the path or name of the serial port.  For example, this<br/>
could be "/dev/ttyS0" on Unix.  On Windows, this could be<br/>
"COM1" or "\\.\COM10".<br/>
SPEED is the speed of the serial port in bits per second.  9600<br/>
is a common value.  SPEED can be nil, see<br/>
`serial-process-configure' for details.<br/>
The buffer is in Term mode; see `term-mode' for the commands to<br/>
use in that buffer.<br/>
Type C-c b to switch to another buffer.
