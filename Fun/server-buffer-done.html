server-buffer-done is a compiled Lisp function in `server.el'.<br/><br/>(server-buffer-done BUFFER &optional FOR-KILLING)<br/><br/>Mark BUFFER as "done" for its client(s).<br/>This buries the buffer, then returns a list of the form (NEXT-BUFFER KILLED).<br/>NEXT-BUFFER is another server buffer, as a suggestion for what to select next,<br/>or nil.  KILLED is t if we killed BUFFER (typically, because it was visiting<br/>a temp file).<br/>FOR-KILLING if non-nil indicates that we are called from `kill-buffer'.
