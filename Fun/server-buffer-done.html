</br>
(server-buffer-done <u>BUFFER</u> &optional <u>FOR-KILLING</u>)</br>
</br>
Mark <u>BUFFER</u> as "done" for its client(s).</br>
This buries the buffer, then returns a list of the form (NEXT-BUFFER KILLED).</br>
NEXT-BUFFER is another server buffer, as a suggestion for what to select next,</br>
or nil.  KILLED is t if we killed <u>BUFFER</u> (typically, because it was visiting</br>
a temp file).</br>
<u>FOR-KILLING</u> if non-nil indicates that we are called from `kill-buffer'.
