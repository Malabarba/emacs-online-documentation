</br>
It is bound to C-x #.</br>
</br>
<code>(server-edit <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Switch to next server editing buffer; say "Done" for current buffer.</br>
If a server buffer is current, it is marked "done" and optionally saved.</br>
The buffer is also killed if it did not exist before the clients asked for it.</br>
When all of a client's buffers are marked as "done", the client is notified.</br>
</br>
Temporary files such as MH &lt;draft> files are always saved and backed up,</br>
no questions asked.  (The variable `make-backup-files', if nil, still</br>
inhibits a backup; you can set it locally in a particular buffer to</br>
prevent a backup for it.)  The variable `server-temp-file-regexp' controls</br>
which filenames are considered temporary.</br>
</br>
If invoked with a prefix argument, or if there is no server process running,</br>
starts server process and that is all.  Invoked by C-x #.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
