server-switch-buffer is a compiled Lisp function in `server.el'.<br/><br/>(server-switch-buffer &optional NEXT-BUFFER KILLED-ONE FILEPOS)<br/><br/>Switch to another buffer, preferably one that has a client.<br/>Arg NEXT-BUFFER is a suggestion; if it is a live buffer, use it.<br/><br/>KILLED-ONE is t in a recursive call if we have already killed one<br/>temp-file server buffer.  This means we should avoid the final<br/>"switch to some other buffer" since we've already effectively<br/>done that.<br/><br/>FILEPOS specifies a new buffer position for NEXT-BUFFER, if we<br/>visit NEXT-BUFFER in an existing window.  If non-nil, it should<br/>be a cons cell (LINENUMBER . COLUMNNUMBER).
