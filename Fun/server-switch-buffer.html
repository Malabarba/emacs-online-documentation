<strong>server-switch-buffer</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>server.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(server-switch-buffer &optional <u>NEXT-BUFFER</u> <u>KILLED-ONE</u> <u>FILEPOS</u>)</br>
</br>
Switch to another buffer, preferably one that has a client.</br>
Arg <u>NEXT-BUFFER</u> is a suggestion; if it is a live buffer, use it.</br>
</br>
<u>KILLED-ONE</u> is t in a recursive call if we have already killed one</br>
temp-file server buffer.  This means we should avoid the final</br>
"switch to some other buffer" since we've already effectively</br>
done that.</br>
</br>
<u>FILEPOS</u> specifies a new buffer position for <u>NEXT-BUFFER</u>, if we</br>
visit <u>NEXT-BUFFER</u> in an existing window.  If non-nil, it should</br>
be a cons cell (LINENUMBER . COLUMNNUMBER).
