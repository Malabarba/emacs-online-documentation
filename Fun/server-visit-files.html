<strong>server-visit-files</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>server.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(server-visit-files <u>FILES</u> <u>PROC</u> &optional <u>NOWAIT</u>)</br>
</br>
Find <u>FILES</u> and return a list of buffers created.</br>
<u>FILES</u> is an alist whose elements are (FILENAME . FILEPOS)</br>
where FILEPOS can be nil or a pair (LINENUMBER . COLUMNNUMBER).</br>
<u>PROC</u> is the client that requested this operation.</br>
<u>NOWAIT</u> non-nil means this client is not waiting for the results,</br>
so don't mark these buffers specially, just visit them normally.
