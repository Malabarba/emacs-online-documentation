<strong>server-visit-files</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>server.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(server-visit-files FILES PROC &optional NOWAIT)<br/>
<br/>
Find FILES and return a list of buffers created.<br/>
FILES is an alist whose elements are (FILENAME . FILEPOS)<br/>
where FILEPOS can be nil or a pair (LINENUMBER . COLUMNNUMBER).<br/>
PROC is the client that requested this operation.<br/>
NOWAIT non-nil means this client is not waiting for the results,<br/>
so don't mark these buffers specially, just visit them normally.
