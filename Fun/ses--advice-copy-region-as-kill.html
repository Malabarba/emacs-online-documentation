<strong>ses--advice-copy-region-as-kill</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ses.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ses--advice-copy-region-as-kill <u>CRAK-FUN</u> <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
It doesn't make sense to copy read-only or intangible attributes into the</br>
kill ring.  It probably doesn't make sense to copy keymap properties.</br>
We'll assume copying front-sticky properties doesn't make sense, either.</br>
</br>
This advice also includes some SES-specific code because otherwise it's too</br>
hard to override how mouse-1 works.
