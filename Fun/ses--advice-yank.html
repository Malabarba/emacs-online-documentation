</br>
(ses--advice-yank <u>YANK-FUN</u> &optional <u>ARG</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
In SES mode, the yanked text is inserted as cells.</br>
</br>
If the text contains 'ses attributes (meaning it went to the kill-ring from a</br>
SES buffer), the formulas and print functions are restored for the cells.  If</br>
the text contains tabs, this is an insertion of tab-separated formulas.</br>
Otherwise the text is inserted as the formula for the current cell.</br>
</br>
When inserting cells, the formulas are usually relocated to keep the same</br>
relative references to neighboring cells.  This is best if the formulas</br>
generally refer to other cells within the yanked text.  You can use the C-u</br>
prefix to specify insertion without relocation, which is best when the</br>
formulas refer to cells outside the yanked text.</br>
</br>
When inserting formulas, the text is treated as a string constant if it doesn't</br>
make sense as a sexp or would otherwise be considered a symbol.  Use 'sym to</br>
explicitly insert a symbol, or use the C-u prefix to treat all unmarked words</br>
as symbols.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
