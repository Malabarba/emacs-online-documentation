<strong>ses-cell-set-formula</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ses.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ses-cell-set-formula ROW COL FORMULA)<br/>
<br/>
Store a new formula for (ROW . COL) and enqueue the cell for<br/>
recalculation via `post-command-hook'.  Updates the reference lists for the<br/>
cells that this cell refers to.  Does not update cell value or reprint the<br/>
cell.  To avoid inconsistencies, this function is not interruptible, which<br/>
means Emacs will crash if FORMULA contains a circular list.
