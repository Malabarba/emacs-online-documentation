<strong>ses-cell</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>ses.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ses-cell SYM VALUE FORMULA PRINTER REFERENCES)<br/>
<br/>
Load a cell SYM from the spreadsheet file.  Does not recompute VALUE from<br/>
FORMULA, does not reprint using PRINTER, does not check REFERENCES.  This is a<br/>
macro to prevent propagate-on-load viruses.  Safety-checking for FORMULA and<br/>
PRINTER are deferred until first use.
