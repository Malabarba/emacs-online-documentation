<strong>ses-print-cell</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ses.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(ses-print-cell <u>ROW</u> <u>COL</u>)</br>
</br>
Format and print the value of cell (<u>ROW</u>,<u>COL</u>) to the print area.</br>
Use the cell's printer function.  If the cell's new print form is too wide,</br>
it will spill over into the following cell, but will not run off the end of the</br>
row or overwrite the next non-nil field.  Result is nil for normal operation,</br>
or the error signal if the printer function failed and the cell was formatted</br>
with "%s".  If the cell's value is *skip*, nothing is printed because the</br>
preceding cell has spilled over.
