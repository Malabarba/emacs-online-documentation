<strong>ses-range</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>ses.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ses-range FROM TO &rest REST)<br/>
<br/>
Expand to a list of cell-symbols for the range going from<br/>
FROM up to TO.  The range automatically expands to include any<br/>
new row or column inserted into its middle.  The SES library code<br/>
specifically looks for the symbol `ses-range', so don't create an<br/>
alias for this macro!<br/>
<br/>
By passing in REST some flags one can configure the way the range<br/>
is read and how it is formatted.<br/>
<br/>
In the sequel we assume that cells A1, B1, A2 B2 have respective values<br/>
1 2 3 and 4.<br/>
<br/>
Readout direction is specified by a `>v', '`>^', `<v', `<^',<br/>
`v>', `v<', `^>', `^<' flag.  For historical reasons, in absence<br/>
of such a flag, a default direction of `^<' is assumed.  This<br/>
way `(ses-range A1 B2 ^>)' will evaluate to `(1 3 2 4)',<br/>
while `(ses-range A1 B2 >^)' will evaluate to (3 4 1 2).<br/>
<br/>
If the range is one row, then `>' can be used as a shorthand to<br/>
`>v' or `>^', and `<' to `<v' or `<^'.<br/>
<br/>
If the range is one column, then `v' can be used as a shorthand to<br/>
`v>' or `v<', and `^' to `^>' or `v<'.<br/>
<br/>
A `!' flag will remove all cells whose value is nil or `*skip*'.<br/>
<br/>
A `_' flag will replace nil or `*skip*' by the value following<br/>
the `_' flag.  If the `_' flag is the last argument, then they are<br/>
replaced by integer 0.<br/>
<br/>
A `*', `*1' or `*2' flag will vectorize the range in the sense of<br/>
Calc.  See info node `(Calc) Top'.  Flag `*' will output either a<br/>
vector or a matrix depending on the number of rows, `*1' will<br/>
flatten the result to a one row vector, and `*2' will make a<br/>
matrix whatever the number of rows.<br/>
<br/>
Warning: interaction with Calc is experimental and may produce<br/>
confusing results if you are not aware of Calc data format.<br/>
Use `math-format-value' as a printer for Calc objects.
