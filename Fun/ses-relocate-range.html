<strong>ses-relocate-range</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>ses.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ses-relocate-range RANGE STARTROW STARTCOL ROWINCR COLINCR)<br/>
<br/>
Relocate one RANGE, of the form '(ses-range min max).  Cells starting<br/>
at (STARTROW,STARTCOL) are being shifted by (ROWINCR,COLINCR).  Result is the<br/>
new range, or nil if the entire range is deleted.  If new rows are being added<br/>
just beyond the end of a row range, or new columns just beyond a column range,<br/>
the new rows/columns will be added to the range.  Sets `ses-relocate-return'<br/>
if the range was altered.
