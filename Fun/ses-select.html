<strong>ses-select</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>ses.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(ses-select FROMRANGE TEST TORANGE)<br/>
<br/>
Select cells in FROMRANGE that are `equal' to TEST.<br/>
For each match, return the corresponding cell from TORANGE.<br/>
The ranges are macroexpanded but not evaluated so they should be<br/>
either (ses-range BEG END) or (list ...).  The TEST is evaluated.
