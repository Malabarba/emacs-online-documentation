<strong>set-buffer</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(set-buffer <u>BUFFER-OR-NAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Make buffer <u>BUFFER-OR-NAME</u> current for editing operations.</br>
<u>BUFFER-OR-NAME</u> may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.</br>
See also `with-current-buffer' when you want to make a buffer current</br>
temporarily.  This function does not display the buffer, so its effect</br>
ends when the current command terminates.  Use `switch-to-buffer' or</br>
`pop-to-buffer' to switch buffers permanently.</br>
The return value is the buffer made current.
