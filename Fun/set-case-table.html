<strong>set-case-table</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(set-case-table <u>TABLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Select a new case table for the current buffer.</br>
A case table is a char-table which maps characters</br>
to their lower-case equivalents.  It also has three "extra" slots</br>
which may be additional char-tables or nil.</br>
These slots are called UPCASE, CANONICALIZE and EQUIVALENCES.</br>
UPCASE maps each non-upper-case character to its upper-case equivalent.</br>
 (The value in UPCASE for an upper-case character is never used.)</br>
 If lower and upper case characters are in 1-1 correspondence,</br>
 you may use nil and the upcase table will be deduced from DOWNCASE.</br>
CANONICALIZE maps each character to a canonical equivalent;</br>
 any two characters that are related by case-conversion have the same</br>
 canonical equivalent character; it may be nil, in which case it is</br>
 deduced from DOWNCASE and UPCASE.</br>
EQUIVALENCES is a map that cyclically permutes each equivalence class</br>
 (of characters with the same canonical equivalent); it may be nil,</br>
 in which case it is deduced from CANONICALIZE.
