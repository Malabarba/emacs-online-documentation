<strong>set-frame-configuration</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>frame.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(set-frame-configuration CONFIGURATION &optional NODELETE)<br/>
<br/>
Restore the frames to the state described by CONFIGURATION.<br/>
Each frame listed in CONFIGURATION has its position, size, window<br/>
configuration, and other parameters set as specified in CONFIGURATION.<br/>
However, this function does not restore deleted frames.<br/>
<br/>
Ordinarily, this function deletes all existing frames not<br/>
listed in CONFIGURATION.  But if optional second argument NODELETE<br/>
is given and non-nil, the unwanted frames are iconified instead.
