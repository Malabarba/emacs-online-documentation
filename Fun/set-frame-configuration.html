<strong>set-frame-configuration</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>frame.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(set-frame-configuration <u>CONFIGURATION</u> &optional <u>NODELETE</u>)</br>
</br>
Restore the frames to the state described by <u>CONFIGURATION</u>.</br>
Each frame listed in <u>CONFIGURATION</u> has its position, size, window</br>
configuration, and other parameters set as specified in <u>CONFIGURATION</u>.</br>
However, this function does not restore deleted frames.</br>
</br>
Ordinarily, this function deletes all existing frames not</br>
listed in <u>CONFIGURATION</u>.  But if optional second argument <u>NODELETE</u></br>
is given and non-nil, the unwanted frames are iconified instead.
