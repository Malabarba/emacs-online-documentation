set-frame-font is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `frame.el'.<br/><br/>(set-frame-font FONT &optional KEEP-SIZE FRAMES)<br/><br/>Set the default font to FONT.<br/>When called interactively, prompt for the name of a font, and use<br/>that font on the selected frame.  When called from Lisp, FONT<br/>should be a font name (a string), a font object, font entity, or<br/>font spec.<br/><br/>If KEEP-SIZE is nil, keep the number of frame lines and columns<br/>fixed.  If KEEP-SIZE is non-nil (or with a prefix argument), try<br/>to keep the current frame size fixed (in pixels) by adjusting the<br/>number of lines and columns.<br/><br/>If FRAMES is nil, apply the font to the selected frame only.<br/>If FRAMES is non-nil, it should be a list of frames to act upon,<br/>or t meaning all graphical frames.  Also, if FRAME is non-nil,<br/>alter the user's Customization settings as though the<br/>font-related attributes of the `default' face had been "set in<br/>this session", so that the font is applied to future frames.
