<strong>set-goal-column</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x C-n.<br/>
<br/>
(set-goal-column ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Set the current horizontal position as a goal for C-n and C-p.<br/>
Those commands will move to this position in the line moved to<br/>
rather than trying to keep the same horizontal position.<br/>
With a non-nil argument ARG, clears out the goal column<br/>
so that C-n and C-p resume vertical motion.<br/>
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column'.
