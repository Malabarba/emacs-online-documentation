<strong>set-language-environment</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x RET l.</br>
</br>
<code>(set-language-environment <u>LANGUAGE-NAME</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Set up multilingual environment for using <u>LANGUAGE-NAME</u>.</br>
This sets the coding system priority and the default input method</br>
and sometimes other things.  <u>LANGUAGE-NAME</u> should be a string</br>
which is the name of a language environment.  For example, "Latin-1"</br>
specifies the character set for the major languages of Western Europe.</br>
</br>
If there is a prior value for `current-language-environment', this</br>
runs the hook `exit-language-environment-hook'.  After setting up</br>
the new language environment, it runs `set-language-environment-hook'.
