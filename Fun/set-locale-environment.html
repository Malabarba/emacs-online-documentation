<strong>set-locale-environment</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule-cmds.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(set-locale-environment &optional LOCALE-NAME FRAME)<br/>
<br/>
Set up multilingual environment for using LOCALE-NAME.<br/>
This sets the language environment, the coding system priority,<br/>
the default input method and sometimes other things.<br/>
<br/>
LOCALE-NAME should be a string which is the name of a locale supported<br/>
by the system.  Often it is of the form xx_XX.CODE, where xx is a<br/>
language, XX is a country, and CODE specifies a character set and<br/>
coding system.  For example, the locale name "ja_JP.EUC" might name<br/>
a locale for Japanese in Japan using the `japanese-iso-8bit'<br/>
coding-system.  The name may also have a modifier suffix, e.g. `@euro'<br/>
or `@cyrillic'.<br/>
<br/>
If LOCALE-NAME is nil, its value is taken from the environment<br/>
variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG (the first one that is set).<br/>
<br/>
The locale names supported by your system can typically be found in a<br/>
directory named `/usr/share/locale' or `/usr/lib/locale'.  LOCALE-NAME<br/>
will be translated according to the table specified by<br/>
`locale-translation-file-name'.<br/>
<br/>
If FRAME is non-nil, only set the keyboard coding system and the<br/>
terminal coding system for the terminal of that frame, and don't<br/>
touch session-global parameters like the language environment.<br/>
