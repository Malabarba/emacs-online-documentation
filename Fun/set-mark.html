set-mark is a compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>(set-mark POS)<br/><br/>Set this buffer's mark to POS.  Don't use this function!<br/>That is to say, don't use this function unless you want<br/>the user to see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous<br/>mark position to be lost.<br/><br/>Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the stack.<br/>This is why most applications should use `push-mark', not `set-mark'.<br/><br/>Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong<br/>purposes.  The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.<br/>Most editing commands should not alter the mark.<br/>To remember a location for internal use in the Lisp program,<br/>store it in a Lisp variable.  Example:<br/><br/>   (let ((beg (point))) (forward-line 1) (delete-region beg (point))).
