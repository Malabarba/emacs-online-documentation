<strong>set-mouse-pixel-position</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(set-mouse-pixel-position FRAME X Y)<br/>
<br/>
Move the mouse pointer to pixel position (X,Y) in FRAME.<br/>
The position is given in pixels, where (0, 0) is the upper-left corner<br/>
of the frame, X is the horizontal offset, and Y is the vertical offset.<br/>
<br/>
Note, this is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.<br/>
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible<br/>
before calling this function on it, like this.<br/>
  (while (not (frame-visible-p frame)) (sleep-for .5))
