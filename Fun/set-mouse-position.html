<strong>set-mouse-position</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(set-mouse-position <u>FRAME</u> <u>X</u> <u>Y</u>)</br>
</br>
Move the mouse pointer to the center of character cell (<u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>) in <u>FRAME</u>.</br>
Coordinates are relative to the frame, not a window,</br>
so the coordinates of the top left character in the frame</br>
may be nonzero due to left-hand scroll bars or the menu bar.</br>
</br>
The position is given in character cells, where (0, 0) is the</br>
upper-left corner of the frame, <u>X</u> is the horizontal offset, and <u>Y</u> is</br>
the vertical offset.</br>
</br>
This function is a no-op for an <u>X</u> frame that is not visible.</br>
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible</br>
before calling this function on it, like this.</br>
  (while (not (frame-visible-p frame)) (sleep-for .5))
