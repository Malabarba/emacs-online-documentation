<strong>set-text-properties</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(set-text-properties START END PROPERTIES &optional OBJECT)<br/>
<br/>
Completely replace properties of text from START to END.<br/>
The third argument PROPERTIES is the new property list.<br/>
If the optional fourth argument OBJECT is a buffer (or nil, which means<br/>
the current buffer), START and END are buffer positions (integers or<br/>
markers).  If OBJECT is a string, START and END are 0-based indices into it.<br/>
If PROPERTIES is nil, the effect is to remove all properties from<br/>
the designated part of OBJECT.
