set-time-zone-rule is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(set-time-zone-rule TZ)<br/><br/>Set the local time zone using TZ, a string specifying a time zone rule.<br/>If TZ is nil, use implementation-defined default time zone information.<br/>If TZ is t, use Universal Time.<br/><br/>Instead of calling this function, you typically want (setenv "TZ" TZ).<br/>That changes both the environment of the Emacs process and the<br/>variable `process-environment', whereas `set-time-zone-rule' affects<br/>only the former.
