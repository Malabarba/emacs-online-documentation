set-variable is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>(set-variable VARIABLE VALUE &optional MAKE-LOCAL)<br/><br/>Set VARIABLE to VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.<br/>VARIABLE should be a user option variable name, a Lisp variable<br/>meant to be customized by users.  You should enter VALUE in Lisp syntax,<br/>so if you want VALUE to be a string, you must surround it with doublequotes.<br/>VALUE is used literally, not evaluated.<br/><br/>If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if<br/>it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read VALUE.<br/><br/>If VARIABLE has been defined with `defcustom', then the type information<br/>in the definition is used to check that VALUE is valid.<br/><br/>With a prefix argument, set VARIABLE to VALUE buffer-locally.
