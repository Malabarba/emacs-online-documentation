<strong>set-window-buffer-start-and-point</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(set-window-buffer-start-and-point WINDOW BUFFER &optional START POINT)<br/>
<br/>
Set WINDOW's buffer to BUFFER.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
Optional argument START non-nil means set WINDOW's start position<br/>
to START.  Optional argument POINT non-nil means set WINDOW's<br/>
point to POINT.  If WINDOW is selected this also sets BUFFER's<br/>
`point' to POINT.  If WINDOW is selected and the buffer it showed<br/>
before was current this also makes BUFFER the current buffer.
