set-window-dedicated-p is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(set-window-dedicated-p WINDOW FLAG)<br/><br/>Mark WINDOW as dedicated according to FLAG.<br/>WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  FLAG<br/>non-nil means mark WINDOW as dedicated to its buffer.  FLAG nil means<br/>mark WINDOW as non-dedicated.  Return FLAG.<br/><br/>When a window is dedicated to its buffer, `display-buffer' will refrain<br/>from displaying another buffer in it.  `get-lru-window' and<br/>`get-largest-window' treat dedicated windows specially.<br/>`delete-windows-on', `replace-buffer-in-windows', `quit-window',<br/>`quit-restore-window' and `kill-buffer' can delete a dedicated window<br/>and the containing frame.<br/><br/>As a special case, if FLAG is t, mark WINDOW as "strongly" dedicated to<br/>its buffer.  Functions like `set-window-buffer' may change the buffer<br/>displayed by a window, unless that window is strongly dedicated to its<br/>buffer.  If and when `set-window-buffer' displays another buffer in a<br/>window, it also makes sure that the window is no more dedicated.
