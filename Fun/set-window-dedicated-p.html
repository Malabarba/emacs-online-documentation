</br>
(set-window-dedicated-p <u>WINDOW</u> <u>FLAG</u>)</br>
</br>
Mark <u>WINDOW</u> as dedicated according to <u>FLAG</u>.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  <u>FLAG</u></br>
non-nil means mark <u>WINDOW</u> as dedicated to its buffer.  <u>FLAG</u> nil means</br>
mark <u>WINDOW</u> as non-dedicated.  Return <u>FLAG</u>.</br>
</br>
When a window is dedicated to its buffer, `display-buffer' will refrain</br>
from displaying another buffer in it.  `get-lru-window' and</br>
`get-largest-window' treat dedicated windows specially.</br>
`delete-windows-on', `replace-buffer-in-windows', `quit-window',</br>
`quit-restore-window' and `kill-buffer' can delete a dedicated window</br>
and the containing frame.</br>
</br>
As a special case, if <u>FLAG</u> is t, mark <u>WINDOW</u> as "strongly" dedicated to</br>
its buffer.  Functions like `set-window-buffer' may change the buffer</br>
displayed by a window, unless that window is strongly dedicated to its</br>
buffer.  If and when `set-window-buffer' displays another buffer in a</br>
window, it also makes sure that the window is no more dedicated.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
