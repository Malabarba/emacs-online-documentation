<strong>set-window-text-height</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(set-window-text-height WINDOW HEIGHT)<br/>
<br/>
Set the height in lines of the text display area of WINDOW to HEIGHT.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
HEIGHT doesn't include the mode line or header line, if any, or<br/>
any partial-height lines in the text display area.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the current implementation of this function cannot<br/>
always set the height exactly, but attempts to be conservative,<br/>
by allocating more lines than are actually needed in the case<br/>
where some error may be present.
