<strong>set-window-text-height</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(set-window-text-height <u>WINDOW</u> <u>HEIGHT</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the height in lines of the text display area of <u>WINDOW</u> to <u>HEIGHT</u>.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
<u>HEIGHT</u> doesn't include the mode line or header line, if any, or</br>
any partial-height lines in the text display area.</br>
</br>
Note that the current implementation of this function cannot</br>
always set the height exactly, but attempts to be conservative,</br>
by allocating more lines than are actually needed in the case</br>
where some error may be present.
