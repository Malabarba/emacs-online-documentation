<strong>setf</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp macro in `<code>gv.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(setf PLACE VAL PLACE VAL ...)<br/>
<br/>
Set each PLACE to the value of its VAL.<br/>
This is a generalized version of `setq'; the PLACEs may be symbolic<br/>
references such as (car x) or (aref x i), as well as plain symbols.<br/>
For example, (setf (cadr x) y) is equivalent to (setcar (cdr x) y).<br/>
The return value is the last VAL in the list.
