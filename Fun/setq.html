<strong>setq</strong> is a special form in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(setq [SYM VAL]...)<br/>
<br/>
Set each SYM to the value of its VAL.<br/>
The symbols SYM are variables; they are literal (not evaluated).<br/>
The values VAL are expressions; they are evaluated.<br/>
Thus, (setq x (1+ y)) sets `x' to the value of `(1+ y)'.<br/>
The second VAL is not computed until after the first SYM is set, and so on;<br/>
each VAL can use the new value of variables set earlier in the `setq'.<br/>
The return value of the `setq' form is the value of the last VAL.
