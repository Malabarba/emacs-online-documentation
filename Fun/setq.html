<strong>setq</strong> is a special form in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(setq [<u>SYM</u> <u>VAL</u>]...)</br>
</br>
Set each <u>SYM</u> to the value of its <u>VAL</u>.</br>
The symbols <u>SYM</u> are variables; they are literal (not evaluated).</br>
The values <u>VAL</u> are expressions; they are evaluated.</br>
Thus, (setq x (1+ y)) sets `x' to the value of `(1+ y)'.</br>
The second <u>VAL</u> is not computed until after the first <u>SYM</u> is set, and so on;</br>
each <u>VAL</u> can use the new value of variables set earlier in the `setq'.</br>
The return value of the `setq' form is the value of the last <u>VAL</u>.
