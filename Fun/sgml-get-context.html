<strong>sgml-get-context</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>sgml-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(sgml-get-context &optional <u>UNTIL</u>)</br>
</br>
Determine the context of the current position.</br>
By default, parse until we find a start-tag as the first thing on a line.</br>
If <u>UNTIL</u> is `empty', return even if the context is empty (i.e.</br>
we just skipped over some element and got to a beginning of line).</br>
</br>
The context is a list of tag-info structures.  The last one is the tag</br>
immediately enclosing the current position.</br>
</br>
Point is assumed to be outside of any tag.  If we discover that it's</br>
not the case, the first tag returned is the one inside which we are.
