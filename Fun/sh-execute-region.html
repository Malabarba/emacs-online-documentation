<strong>sh-execute-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(sh-execute-region <u>START</u> <u>END</u> &optional <u>FLAG</u>)</br>
</br>
Pass optional header and region to a subshell for noninteractive execution.</br>
The working directory is that of the buffer, and only environment variables</br>
are already set which is why you can mark a header within the script.</br>
</br>
With a positive prefix ARG, instead of sending region, define header from</br>
beginning of buffer to point.  With a negative prefix ARG, instead of sending</br>
region, clear header.
