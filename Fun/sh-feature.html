sh-feature is a compiled Lisp function in `sh-script.el'.<br/><br/>(sh-feature ALIST &optional FUNCTION)<br/><br/>Index ALIST by the current shell.<br/>If ALIST isn't a list where every element is a cons, it is returned as is.<br/>Else indexing follows an inheritance logic which works in two ways:<br/><br/>  - Fall back on successive ancestors (see `sh-ancestor-alist') as long as<br/>    the alist contains no value for the current shell.<br/>    The ultimate default is always `sh'.<br/><br/>  - If the value thus looked up is a list starting with `sh-append',<br/>    we call the function `sh-append' with the rest of the list as<br/>    arguments, and use the value.  However, the next element of the<br/>    list is not used as-is; instead, we look it up recursively<br/>    in ALIST to allow the function called to define the value for<br/>    one shell to be derived from another shell.<br/>    The value thus determined is physically replaced into the alist.<br/><br/>If FUNCTION is non-nil, it is called with one argument,<br/>the value thus obtained, and the result is used instead.
