</br>
(sh-feature <u>ALIST</u> &optional <u>FUNCTION</u>)</br>
</br>
Index <u>ALIST</u> by the current shell.</br>
If <u>ALIST</u> isn't a list where every element is a cons, it is returned as is.</br>
Else indexing follows an inheritance logic which works in two ways:</br>
</br>
  - Fall back on successive ancestors (see `sh-ancestor-alist') as long as</br>
    the alist contains no value for the current shell.</br>
    The ultimate default is always `sh'.</br>
</br>
  - If the value thus looked up is a list starting with `sh-append',</br>
    we call the function `sh-append' with the rest of the list as</br>
    arguments, and use the value.  However, the next element of the</br>
    list is not used as-is; instead, we look it up recursively</br>
    in <u>ALIST</u> to allow the function called to define the value for</br>
    one shell to be derived from another shell.</br>
    The value thus determined is physically replaced into the alist.</br>
</br>
If <u>FUNCTION</u> is non-nil, it is called with one argument,</br>
the value thus obtained, and the result is used instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
