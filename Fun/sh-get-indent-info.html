<strong>sh-get-indent-info</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(sh-get-indent-info)</br>
</br>
Return indent-info for this line.</br>
This is a list.  nil means the line is to be left as is.</br>
Otherwise it contains one or more of the following sublists:</br>
(t NUMBER)   NUMBER is the base location in the buffer that indentation is</br>
	     relative to.  If present, this is always the first of the</br>
	     sublists.  The indentation of the line in question is</br>
	     derived from the indentation of this point, possibly</br>
	     modified by subsequent sublists.</br>
(+ VAR)</br>
(- VAR)      Get the value of variable VAR and add to or subtract from</br>
	     the indentation calculated so far.</br>
(= VAR)	     Get the value of variable VAR and *replace* the</br>
	     indentation with its value.  This only occurs for</br>
	     special variables such as `sh-indent-comment'.</br>
STRING	     This is ignored for the purposes of calculating</br>
	     indentation, it is printed in certain cases to help show</br>
	     what the indentation is based on.
