<strong>sh-mark-line</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sh-mark-line MESSAGE POINT BUFFER &optional ADD-LINENUM OCCUR-POINT)<br/>
<br/>
Insert MESSAGE referring to location POINT in current buffer into BUFFER.<br/>
Buffer BUFFER is in `occur-mode'.<br/>
If ADD-LINENUM is non-nil the message is preceded by the line number.<br/>
If OCCUR-POINT is non-nil then the line is marked as a new occurrence<br/>
so that `occur-next' and `occur-prev' will work.
