</br>
(sh-mark-line <u>MESSAGE</u> <u>POINT</u> <u>BUFFER</u> &optional <u>ADD-LINENUM</u> <u>OCCUR-POINT</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert <u>MESSAGE</u> referring to location <u>POINT</u> in current buffer into <u>BUFFER</u>.</br>
Buffer <u>BUFFER</u> is in `occur-mode'.</br>
If <u>ADD-LINENUM</u> is non-nil the message is preceded by the line number.</br>
If <u>OCCUR-POINT</u> is non-nil then the line is marked as a new occurrence</br>
so that `occur-next' and `occur-prev' will work.
