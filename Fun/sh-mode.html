<strong>sh-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sh-mode)<br/>
<br/>
Parent mode: `prog-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
Major mode for editing shell scripts.<br/>
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,<br/>
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.<br/>
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is<br/>
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.<br/>
<br/>
This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by<br/>
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This<br/>
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to<br/>
shell-specific features.<br/>
<br/>
The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.<br/>
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The<br/>
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:<br/>
<br/>
C-c C-c	 case statement<br/>
C-c C-f	 for loop<br/>
C-c (	 function definition<br/>
C-c TAB	 if statement<br/>
C-c C-l	 indexed loop from 1 to n<br/>
C-c C-o	 while getopts loop<br/>
C-c C-r	 repeat loop<br/>
C-c C-s	 select loop<br/>
C-c C-u	 until loop<br/>
C-c C-w	 while loop<br/>
<br/>
For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:<br/>
C-c ?	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.<br/>
C-c =	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.<br/>
C-c <	Change the indentation variable so this line<br/>
would indent to the way it currently is.<br/>
C-c >  Set the indentation variables so the<br/>
buffer indents as it currently is indented.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DEL	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.<br/>
C-j	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.<br/>
M-e	 Go to end of successive commands.<br/>
M-a	 Go to beginning of successive commands.<br/>
C-c :	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.<br/>
C-M-x	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.<br/>
<br/>
`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two<br/>
unquoted < insert a here document.<br/>
<br/>
If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can<br/>
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly<br/>
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.<br/>
<br/>
If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use C-c C-x<br/>
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode `prog-mode' might have run,<br/>
this mode runs the hook `sh-mode-hook', as the final step<br/>
during initialization.
