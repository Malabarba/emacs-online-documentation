<strong>sh-set-shell</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sh-set-shell SHELL &optional NO-QUERY-FLAG INSERT-FLAG)<br/>
<br/>
Set this buffer's shell to SHELL (a string).<br/>
When used interactively, insert the proper starting #!-line,<br/>
and make the visited file executable via `executable-set-magic',<br/>
perhaps querying depending on the value of `executable-query'.<br/>
<br/>
When this function is called noninteractively, INSERT-FLAG (the third<br/>
argument) controls whether to insert a #!-line and think about making<br/>
the visited file executable, and NO-QUERY-FLAG (the second argument)<br/>
controls whether to query about making the visited file executable.<br/>
<br/>
Calls the value of `sh-set-shell-hook' if set.
