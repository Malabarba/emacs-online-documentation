<strong>sh-set-shell</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(sh-set-shell <u>SHELL</u> &optional <u>NO-QUERY-FLAG</u> <u>INSERT-FLAG</u>)</br>
</br>
Set this buffer's shell to <u>SHELL</u> (a string).</br>
When used interactively, insert the proper starting #!-line,</br>
and make the visited file executable via `executable-set-magic',</br>
perhaps querying depending on the value of `executable-query'.</br>
</br>
When this function is called noninteractively, <u>INSERT-FLAG</u> (the third</br>
argument) controls whether to insert a #!-line and think about making</br>
the visited file executable, and <u>NO-QUERY-FLAG</u> (the second argument)</br>
controls whether to query about making the visited file executable.</br>
</br>
Calls the value of `sh-set-shell-hook' if set.
