<strong>sh-smie--newline-semi-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sh-smie--newline-semi-p &optional TOK)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if a newline should be treated as a semi-colon.<br/>
Here we assume that a newline should be treated as a semi-colon unless it<br/>
comes right after a special keyword.<br/>
This function does not pay attention to line-continuations.<br/>
If TOK is nil, point should be before the newline; otherwise, TOK is the token<br/>
before the newline and in that case point should be just before the token.
