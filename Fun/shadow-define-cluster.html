<strong>shadow-define-cluster</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>shadowfile.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(shadow-define-cluster <u>NAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Edit (or create) the definition of a cluster <u>NAME</u>.</br>
This is a group of hosts that share directories, so that copying to or from</br>
one of them is sufficient to update the file on all of them.  Clusters are</br>
defined by a name, the network address of a primary host (the one we copy</br>
files to), and a regular expression that matches the hostnames of all the</br>
sites in the cluster.
