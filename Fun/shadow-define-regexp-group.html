<strong>shadow-define-regexp-group</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>shadowfile.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(shadow-define-regexp-group)</br>
</br>
Make each of a group of files be shared between hosts.</br>
Prompts for regular expression; files matching this are shared between a list</br>
of sites, which are also prompted for.  The filenames must be identical on all</br>
hosts (if they aren't, use `shadow-define-literal-group' instead of this</br>
function).  Each site can be either a hostname or the name of a cluster (see</br>
`shadow-define-cluster').
