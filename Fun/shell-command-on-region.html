shell-command-on-region is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to M-|, <menu-bar> <tools> <shell-on-region>.<br/><br/>(shell-command-on-region START END COMMAND &optional OUTPUT-BUFFER REPLACE ERROR-BUFFER DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER)<br/><br/>Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell with region as input.<br/>Normally display output (if any) in temp buffer `*Shell Command Output*';<br/>Prefix arg means replace the region with it.  Return the exit code of<br/>COMMAND.<br/><br/>To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters<br/>in the input and output to the shell command, use C-x RET c<br/>before this command.  By default, the input (from the current buffer)<br/>is encoded using coding-system specified by `process-coding-system-alist',<br/>falling back to `default-process-coding-system' if no match for COMMAND<br/>is found in `process-coding-system-alist'.<br/><br/>Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding<br/>`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.<br/><br/>If the command generates output, the output may be displayed<br/>in the echo area or in a buffer.<br/>If the output is short enough to display in the echo area<br/>(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if<br/>`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.<br/>Otherwise it is displayed in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.<br/>The output is available in that buffer in both cases.<br/><br/>If there is output and an error, a message about the error<br/>appears at the end of the output.  If there is no output, or if<br/>output is inserted in the current buffer, the buffer `*Shell<br/>Command Output*' is deleted.<br/><br/>Optional fourth arg OUTPUT-BUFFER specifies where to put the<br/>command's output.  If the value is a buffer or buffer name, put<br/>the output there.  Any other value, including nil, means to<br/>insert the output in the current buffer.  In either case, the<br/>output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).<br/><br/>Optional fifth arg REPLACE, if non-nil, means to insert the<br/>output in place of text from START to END, putting point and mark<br/>around it.<br/><br/>Optional sixth arg ERROR-BUFFER, if non-nil, specifies a buffer<br/>or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error<br/>output.  If nil, error output is mingled with regular output.<br/>When called interactively, `shell-command-default-error-buffer'<br/>is used for ERROR-BUFFER.<br/><br/>Optional seventh arg DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER, if non-nil, means to<br/>display the error buffer if there were any errors.  When called<br/>interactively, this is t.
