<strong>shell-copy-environment-variable</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(shell-copy-environment-variable <u>VARIABLE</u>)</br>
</br>
Copy the environment variable <u>VARIABLE</u> from the subshell to Emacs.</br>
This command reads the value of the specified environment variable</br>
in the shell, and sets the same environment variable in Emacs</br>
(what `getenv' in Emacs would return) to that value.</br>
That value will affect any new subprocesses that you subsequently start</br>
from Emacs.
