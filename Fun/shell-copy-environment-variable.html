<strong>shell-copy-environment-variable</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(shell-copy-environment-variable VARIABLE)<br/>
<br/>
Copy the environment variable VARIABLE from the subshell to Emacs.<br/>
This command reads the value of the specified environment variable<br/>
in the shell, and sets the same environment variable in Emacs<br/>
(what `getenv' in Emacs would return) to that value.<br/>
That value will affect any new subprocesses that you subsequently start<br/>
from Emacs.
