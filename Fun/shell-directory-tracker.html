<strong>shell-directory-tracker</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(shell-directory-tracker <u>STR</u>)</br>
</br>
Tracks cd, pushd and popd commands issued to the shell.</br>
This function is called on each input passed to the shell.</br>
It watches for cd, pushd and popd commands and sets the buffer's</br>
default directory to track these commands.</br>
</br>
You may toggle this tracking on and off with M-x shell-dirtrack-mode.</br>
If Emacs gets confused, you can resync with the shell with M-x dirs.</br>
(The `dirtrack' package provides an alternative implementation of this</br>
feature - see the function `dirtrack-mode'.)</br>
</br>
See variables `shell-cd-regexp', `shell-chdrive-regexp', `shell-pushd-regexp',</br>
and  `shell-popd-regexp', while `shell-pushd-tohome', `shell-pushd-dextract',</br>
and `shell-pushd-dunique' control the behavior of the relevant command.</br>
</br>
Environment variables are expanded, see function `substitute-in-file-name'.
