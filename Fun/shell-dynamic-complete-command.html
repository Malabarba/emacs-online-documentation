<strong>shell-dynamic-complete-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(shell-dynamic-complete-command)<br/>
<br/>
Dynamically complete the command at point.<br/>
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it<br/>
searches `exec-path' (minus the trailing Emacs library path) for completion<br/>
candidates.  Note that this may not be the same as the shell's idea of the<br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
Completion is dependent on the value of `shell-completion-execonly', plus<br/>
those that effect file completion.<br/>
<br/>
Returns t if successful.
