</br>
</br>
(shell-dynamic-complete-environment-variable)</br>
</br>
Dynamically complete the environment variable at point.</br>
Completes if after a variable, i.e., if it starts with a "$".</br>
</br>
This function is similar to `comint-dynamic-complete-filename', except that it</br>
searches `process-environment' for completion candidates.  Note that this may</br>
not be the same as the interpreter's idea of variable names.  The main problem</br>
with this type of completion is that `process-environment' is the environment</br>
which Emacs started with.  Emacs does not track changes to the environment made</br>
by the interpreter.  Perhaps it would be more accurate if this function was</br>
called `shell-dynamic-complete-process-environment-variable'.</br>
</br>
Returns non-nil if successful.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
