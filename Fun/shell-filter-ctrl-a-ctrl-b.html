<strong>shell-filter-ctrl-a-ctrl-b</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(shell-filter-ctrl-a-ctrl-b STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Remove `^A' and `^B' characters from comint output.<br/>
<br/>
Bash uses these characters as internal quoting characters in its<br/>
prompt.  Due to a bug in some bash versions (including 2.03,<br/>
2.04, and 2.05b), they may erroneously show up when bash is<br/>
started with the `--noediting' option and Select Graphic<br/>
Rendition (SGR) control sequences (formerly known as ANSI escape<br/>
sequences) are used to color the prompt.<br/>
<br/>
This function can be put on `comint-preoutput-filter-functions'.
