<strong>shell-quote-wildcard-pattern</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(shell-quote-wildcard-pattern PATTERN)<br/>
<br/>
Quote characters special to the shell in PATTERN, leave wildcards alone.<br/>
<br/>
PATTERN is assumed to represent a file-name wildcard suitable for the<br/>
underlying filesystem.  For Unix and GNU/Linux, each character from the<br/>
set [ \t\n;<>&|()'"#$] is quoted with a backslash; for DOS/Windows, all<br/>
the parts of the pattern which don't include wildcard characters are<br/>
quoted with double quotes.<br/>
<br/>
This function leaves alone existing quote characters (\ on Unix and "<br/>
on Windows), so PATTERN can use them to quote wildcard characters that<br/>
need to be passed verbatim to shell commands.
