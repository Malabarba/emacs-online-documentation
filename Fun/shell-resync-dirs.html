<strong>shell-resync-dirs</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(shell-resync-dirs)<br/>
<br/>
Resync the buffer's idea of the current directory stack.<br/>
This command queries the shell with the command bound to<br/>
`shell-dirstack-query' (default "dirs"), reads the next<br/>
line output and parses it to form the new directory stack.<br/>
DON'T issue this command unless the buffer is at a shell prompt.<br/>
Also, note that if some other subprocess decides to do output<br/>
immediately after the query, its output will be taken as the<br/>
new directory stack -- you lose.  If this happens, just do the<br/>
command again.
