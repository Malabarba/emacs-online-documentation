<strong>shell</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>shell.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(shell &optional BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Run an inferior shell, with I/O through BUFFER (which defaults to `*shell*').<br/>
Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for BUFFER.<br/>
If `default-directory' is a remote file name, it is also prompted<br/>
to change if called with a prefix arg.<br/>
<br/>
If BUFFER exists but shell process is not running, make new shell.<br/>
If BUFFER exists and shell process is running, just switch to BUFFER.<br/>
Program used comes from variable `explicit-shell-file-name',<br/>
 or (if that is nil) from the ESHELL environment variable,<br/>
 or (if that is nil) from `shell-file-name'.<br/>
If a file `~/.emacs_SHELLNAME' exists, or `~/.emacs.d/init_SHELLNAME.sh',<br/>
it is given as initial input (but this may be lost, due to a timing<br/>
error, if the shell discards input when it starts up).<br/>
The buffer is put in Shell mode, giving commands for sending input<br/>
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.  See `shell-mode'.<br/>
See also the variable `shell-prompt-pattern'.<br/>
<br/>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters<br/>
in the input and output to the shell, use C-x RET c<br/>
before M-x shell.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p<br/>
in the shell buffer, after you start the shell.<br/>
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and<br/>
`default-process-coding-system'.<br/>
<br/>
The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name<br/>
such as `explicit-csh-args'.  If that symbol is a variable,<br/>
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.<br/>
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell.<br/>
<br/>
(Type C-h m in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)
