<strong>shr-color-visible</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>shr-color.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(shr-color-visible <u>BG</u> <u>FG</u> &optional <u>FIXED-BACKGROUND</u>)</br>
</br>
Check that <u>BG</u> and <u>FG</u> colors are visible if they are drawn on each other.</br>
Return (bg fg) if they are.  If they are too similar, two new</br>
colors are returned instead.</br>
If <u>FIXED-BACKGROUND</u> is set, and if the color are not visible, a</br>
new background color will not be computed.  Only the foreground</br>
color will be adapted to be visible on <u>BG</u>.
