<strong>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x -.<br/>
<br/>
(shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer &optional WINDOW)<br/>
<br/>
Shrink height of WINDOW if its buffer doesn't need so many lines.<br/>
More precisely, shrink WINDOW vertically to be as small as<br/>
possible, while still showing the full contents of its buffer.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
<br/>
Do not shrink WINDOW to less than `window-min-height' lines.  Do<br/>
nothing if the buffer contains more lines than the present window<br/>
height, or if some of the window's contents are scrolled out of<br/>
view, or if shrinking this window would also shrink another<br/>
window, or if the window is the only window of its frame.<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if the window was shrunk, nil otherwise.
