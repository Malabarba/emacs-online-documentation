<strong>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x -.</br>
</br>
<code>(shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer <em>&optional</em> <u>WINDOW</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Shrink height of <u>WINDOW</u> if its buffer doesn't need so many lines.</br>
More precisely, shrink <u>WINDOW</u> vertically to be as small as</br>
possible, while still showing the full contents of its buffer.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
</br>
Do not shrink <u>WINDOW</u> to less than `window-min-height' lines.  Do</br>
nothing if the buffer contains more lines than the present window</br>
height, or if some of the window's contents are scrolled out of</br>
view, or if shrinking this window would also shrink another</br>
window, or if the window is the only window of its frame.</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if the window was shrunk, nil otherwise.
