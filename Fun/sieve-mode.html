(sieve-mode)</br>
</br>
Major mode for editing Sieve code.</br>
This is much like C mode except for the syntax of comments.  Its keymap</br>
inherits from C mode's and it has the same variables for customizing</br>
indentation.  It has its own abbrev table and its own syntax table.</br>
</br>
Turning on Sieve mode runs `sieve-mode-hook'.
