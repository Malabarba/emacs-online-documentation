An error symbol is a symbol with an `error-conditions' property</br>
that is a list of condition names.</br>
A handler for any of those names will get to handle this signal.</br>
The symbol `error' should normally be one of them.</br>
</br>
<u>DATA</u> should be a list.  Its elements are printed as part of the error message.</br>
See Info anchor `(elisp)Definition of signal' for some details on how this</br>
error message is constructed.</br>
If the signal is handled, <u>DATA</u> is made available to the handler.</br>
