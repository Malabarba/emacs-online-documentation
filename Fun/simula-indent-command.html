<strong>simula-indent-command</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simula.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(simula-indent-command &optional WHOLE-EXP)<br/>
<br/>
Indent current line as SIMULA code, or insert TAB character.<br/>
If `simula-tab-always-indent' is non-nil, always indent current line.<br/>
Otherwise, indent only if point is before any non-whitespace<br/>
character on the line.<br/>
<br/>
A numeric argument, regardless of its value, means indent rigidly<br/>
all the lines of the SIMULA statement after point so that this line<br/>
becomes properly indented.<br/>
The relative indentation among the lines of the statement are preserved.
