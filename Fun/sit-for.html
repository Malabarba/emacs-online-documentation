sit-for is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(sit-for SECONDS &optional NODISP)<br/><br/>Perform redisplay, then wait for SECONDS seconds or until input is available.<br/>SECONDS may be a floating-point value.<br/>(On operating systems that do not support waiting for fractions of a<br/>second, floating-point values are rounded down to the nearest integer.)<br/><br/>If optional arg NODISP is t, don't redisplay, just wait for input.<br/>Redisplay does not happen if input is available before it starts.<br/><br/>Value is t if waited the full time with no input arriving, and nil otherwise.<br/><br/>An obsolete, but still supported form is<br/>(sit-for SECONDS &optional MILLISECONDS NODISP)<br/>where the optional arg MILLISECONDS specifies an additional wait period,<br/>in milliseconds; this was useful when Emacs was built without<br/>floating point support.
