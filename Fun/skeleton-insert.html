</br>
(skeleton-insert <u>SKELETON</u> &optional <u>REGIONS</u> <u>STR</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert the complex statement skeleton <u>SKELETON</u> describes very concisely.</br>
</br>
With optional second argument <u>REGIONS</u>, wrap first interesting point</br>
(`_') in skeleton around next <u>REGIONS</u> words, if <u>REGIONS</u> is positive.</br>
If <u>REGIONS</u> is negative, wrap <u>REGIONS</u> preceding interregions into first</br>
<u>REGIONS</u> interesting positions (successive `_'s) in skeleton.</br>
</br>
An interregion is the stretch of text between two contiguous marked</br>
points.  If you marked A B C [] (where [] is the cursor) in</br>
alphabetical order, the 3 interregions are simply the last 3 regions.</br>
But if you marked B A [] C, the interregions are B-A, A-[], []-C.</br>
</br>
The optional third argument <u>STR</u>, if specified, is the value for the</br>
variable `str' within the skeleton.  When this is non-nil, the</br>
interactor gets ignored, and this should be a valid skeleton element.</br>
</br>
<u>SKELETON</u> is made up as (INTERACTOR ELEMENT ...).  INTERACTOR may be nil if</br>
not needed, a prompt-string or an expression for complex read functions.</br>
</br>
If ELEMENT is a string or a character it gets inserted (see also</br>
`skeleton-transformation-function').  Other possibilities are:</br>
</br>
	\n	go to next line and indent according to mode, unless</br>
                this is the first/last element of a skeleton and point</br>
                is at bol/eol</br>
	_	interesting point, interregion here</br>
	-	interesting point, no interregion interaction, overrides</br>
		interesting point set by _</br>
	>	indent line (or interregion if > _) according to major mode</br>
	@	add position to `skeleton-positions'</br>
	&	do next ELEMENT if previous moved point</br>
	|	do next ELEMENT if previous didn't move point</br>
	-NUM	delete NUM preceding characters (see `skeleton-untabify')</br>
	resume:	skipped, continue here if quit is signaled</br>
	nil	skipped</br>
</br>
After termination, point will be positioned at the last occurrence of -</br>
or at the first occurrence of _ or at the end of the inserted text.</br>
</br>
Note that \n as the last element of the skeleton only inserts a</br>
newline if not at eol.  If you want to unconditionally insert a newline</br>
at the end of the skeleton, use "\n" instead.  Likewise with \n</br>
as the first element when at bol.</br>
</br>
Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.</br>
ELEMENT may itself be a <u>SKELETON</u> with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted</br>
repeatedly for different inputs.  The <u>SKELETON</u> is processed as often as</br>
the user enters a non-empty string.  C-g terminates skeleton insertion, but</br>
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in</br>
such a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a ".. %s .." it is</br>
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list</br>
of strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.</br>
</br>
Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.</br>
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.</br>
Note that expressions may not return t since this implies an</br>
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them</br>
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are</br>
available:</br>
</br>
	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR</br>
		then: insert previously read string once more</br>
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or nil</br>
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str</br>
	v1, v2	local variables for memorizing anything you want</br>
</br>
When done with skeleton, but before going back to `_'-point call</br>
`skeleton-end-hook' if that is non-nil.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
