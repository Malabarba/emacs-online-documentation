skeleton-pair-insert-maybe is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `skeleton.el'.<br/><br/>(skeleton-pair-insert-maybe ARG)<br/><br/>Insert the character you type ARG times.<br/><br/>With no ARG, if `skeleton-pair' is non-nil, pairing can occur.  If the region<br/>is visible the pair is wrapped around it depending on `skeleton-autowrap'.<br/>Else, if `skeleton-pair-on-word' is non-nil or we are not before or inside a<br/>word, and if `skeleton-pair-filter-function' returns nil, pairing is performed.<br/>Pairing is also prohibited if we are right after a quoting character<br/>such as backslash.<br/><br/>If a match is found in `skeleton-pair-alist', that is inserted, else<br/>the defaults are used.  These are (), [], {}, <> and `' for the<br/>symmetrical ones, and the same character twice for the others.
