<strong>skeleton-pair-insert-maybe</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>skeleton.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(skeleton-pair-insert-maybe <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert the character you type <u>ARG</u> times.</br>
</br>
With no <u>ARG</u>, if `skeleton-pair' is non-nil, pairing can occur.  If the region</br>
is visible the pair is wrapped around it depending on `skeleton-autowrap'.</br>
Else, if `skeleton-pair-on-word' is non-nil or we are not before or inside a</br>
word, and if `skeleton-pair-filter-function' returns nil, pairing is performed.</br>
Pairing is also prohibited if we are right after a quoting character</br>
such as backslash.</br>
</br>
If a match is found in `skeleton-pair-alist', that is inserted, else</br>
the defaults are used.  These are (), [], {}, &lt;> and `' for the</br>
symmetrical ones, and the same character twice for the others.
