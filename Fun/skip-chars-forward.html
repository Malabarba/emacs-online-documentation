<strong>skip-chars-forward</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(skip-chars-forward STRING &optional LIM)<br/>
<br/>
Move point forward, stopping before a char not in STRING, or at pos LIM.<br/>
STRING is like the inside of a `[...]' in a regular expression<br/>
except that `]' is never special and `\' quotes `^', `-' or `\'<br/>
 (but not at the end of a range; quoting is never needed there).<br/>
Thus, with arg "a-zA-Z", this skips letters stopping before first nonletter.<br/>
With arg "^a-zA-Z", skips nonletters stopping before first letter.<br/>
Char classes, e.g. `[:alpha:]', are supported.<br/>
<br/>
Returns the distance traveled, either zero or positive.
