<strong>slot-unbound</strong> is a Lisp function in `<code>eieio.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(slot-unbound &rest <u>LOCAL-ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Slot unbound is invoked during an attempt to reference an unbound slot.</br>
</br>
This is a generic function with only primary methods.</br>
</br>
Implementations:</br>
</br>
`eieio-default-superclass' :PRIMARY (arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4)</br>
Slot unbound is invoked during an attempt to reference an unbound slot.</br>
OBJECT is the instance of the object being reference.  CLASS is the</br>
class of OBJECT, and SLOT-NAME is the offending slot.  This function</br>
throws the signal `unbound-slot'.  You can overload this function and</br>
return the value to use in place of the unbound value.</br>
Argument FN is the function signaling this error.</br>
Use `slot-boundp' to determine if a slot is bound or not.</br>
</br>
In CLOS, the argument list is (CLASS OBJECT SLOT-NAME), but</br>
EIEIO can only dispatch on the first argument, so the first two are swapped.</br>
</br>
<code>(fn OBJECT CLASS SLOT-NAME FN</code>)</br>
</br>
Defined in `eieio.el'</br>
</br>
`eieio-instance-inheritor' :PRIMARY (arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4)</br>
If a slot OBJECT in this CLASS is unbound, try to inherit, or throw a signal.</br>
SLOT-NAME is the offending slot.  FN is the function signaling the error.</br>
</br>
(fn OBJECT CLASS SLOT-NAME FN)</br>
</br>
Defined in `eieio-base.el'</br>
