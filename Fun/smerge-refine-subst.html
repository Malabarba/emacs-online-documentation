<strong>smerge-refine-subst</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>smerge-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(smerge-refine-subst BEG1 END1 BEG2 END2 PROPS-C &optional PREPROC PROPS-R PROPS-A)<br/>
<br/>
Show fine differences in the two regions BEG1..END1 and BEG2..END2.<br/>
PROPS-C is an alist of properties to put (via overlays) on the changes.<br/>
PROPS-R is an alist of properties to put on removed characters.<br/>
PROPS-A is an alist of properties to put on added characters.<br/>
If PROPS-R and PROPS-A are nil, put PROPS-C on all changes.<br/>
If PROPS-C is nil, but PROPS-R and PROPS-A are non-nil,<br/>
put PROPS-A on added characters, PROPS-R on removed characters.<br/>
If PROPS-C, PROPS-R and PROPS-A are non-nil, put PROPS-C on changed characters,<br/>
PROPS-A on added characters, and PROPS-R on removed characters.<br/>
<br/>
If non-nil, PREPROC is called with no argument in a buffer that contains<br/>
a copy of a region, just before preparing it to for `diff'.  It can be<br/>
used to replace chars to try and eliminate some spurious differences.
