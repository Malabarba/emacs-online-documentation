<strong>smie-backward-sexp</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>smie.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(smie-backward-sexp &optional <u>HALFSEXP</u>)</br>
</br>
Skip over one sexp.</br>
<u>HALFSEXP</u> if non-nil, means skip over a partial sexp if needed.  I.e. if the</br>
first token we see is an operator, skip over its left-hand-side argument.</br>
<u>HALFSEXP</u> can also be a token, in which case we should skip the text</br>
assuming it is the left-hand-side argument of that token.</br>
Possible return values:</br>
  (LEFT-LEVEL POS TOKEN): we couldn't skip TOKEN because its right-level</br>
    is too high.  LEFT-LEVEL is the left-level of TOKEN,</br>
    POS is its start position in the buffer.</br>
  (t POS TOKEN): same thing but for an open-paren or the beginning of buffer.</br>
    Instead of t, the `car' can also be some other non-nil non-number value.</br>
  (nil POS TOKEN): we skipped over a paren-like pair.</br>
  nil: we skipped over an identifier, matched parentheses, ...
