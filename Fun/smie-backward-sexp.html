smie-backward-sexp is a compiled Lisp function in `smie.el'.<br/><br/>(smie-backward-sexp &optional HALFSEXP)<br/><br/>Skip over one sexp.<br/>HALFSEXP if non-nil, means skip over a partial sexp if needed.  I.e. if the<br/>first token we see is an operator, skip over its left-hand-side argument.<br/>HALFSEXP can also be a token, in which case we should skip the text<br/>assuming it is the left-hand-side argument of that token.<br/>Possible return values:<br/>  (LEFT-LEVEL POS TOKEN): we couldn't skip TOKEN because its right-level<br/>    is too high.  LEFT-LEVEL is the left-level of TOKEN,<br/>    POS is its start position in the buffer.<br/>  (t POS TOKEN): same thing but for an open-paren or the beginning of buffer.<br/>    Instead of t, the `car' can also be some other non-nil non-number value.<br/>  (nil POS TOKEN): we skipped over a paren-like pair.<br/>  nil: we skipped over an identifier, matched parentheses, ...
