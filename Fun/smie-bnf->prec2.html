<br/>
Convert the BNF grammar into a prec2 table.<br/>
BNF is a list of nonterminal definitions of the form:<br/>
  (NONTERM RHS1 RHS2 ...)<br/>
where each RHS is a (non-empty) list of terminals (aka tokens) or non-terminals.<br/>
Not all grammars are accepted:<br/>
- an RHS cannot be an empty list (this is not needed, since SMIE allows all<br/>
  non-terminals to match the empty string anyway).<br/>
- an RHS cannot have 2 consecutive non-terminals: between each non-terminal<br/>
  needs to be a terminal (aka token).  This is a fundamental limitation of<br/>
  the parsing technology used (operator precedence grammar).<br/>
Additionally, conflicts can occur:<br/>
- The returned prec2 table holds constraints between pairs of<br/>
  token, and for any given pair only one constraint can be<br/>
  present, either: T1 < T2, T1 = T2, or T1 > T2.<br/>
- A token can either be an `opener' (something similar to an open-paren),<br/>
  a `closer' (like a close-paren), or `neither' of the two (e.g. an infix<br/>
  operator, or an inner token like "else").<br/>
Conflicts can be resolved via RESOLVERS, which is a list of elements that can<br/>
be either:<br/>
- a precs table (see `smie-precs->prec2') to resolve conflicting constraints,<br/>
- a constraint (T1 REL T2) where REL is one of = < or >.
