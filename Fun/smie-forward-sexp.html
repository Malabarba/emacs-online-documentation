<strong>smie-forward-sexp</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>smie.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(smie-forward-sexp &optional HALFSEXP)<br/>
<br/>
Skip over one sexp.<br/>
HALFSEXP if non-nil, means skip over a partial sexp if needed.  I.e. if the<br/>
first token we see is an operator, skip over its right-hand-side argument.<br/>
HALFSEXP can also be a token, in which case we should skip the text<br/>
assuming it is the right-hand-side argument of that token.<br/>
Possible return values:<br/>
  (RIGHT-LEVEL POS TOKEN): we couldn't skip TOKEN because its left-level<br/>
    is too high.  RIGHT-LEVEL is the right-level of TOKEN,<br/>
    POS is its end position in the buffer.<br/>
  (t POS TOKEN): same thing but for a close-paren or the end of buffer.<br/>
    Instead of t, the `car' can also be some other non-nil non-number value.<br/>
  (nil POS TOKEN): we skipped over a paren-like pair.<br/>
  nil: we skipped over an identifier, matched parentheses, ...
