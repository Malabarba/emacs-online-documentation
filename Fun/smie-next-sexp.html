<strong>smie-next-sexp</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>smie.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(smie-next-sexp NEXT-TOKEN NEXT-SEXP OP-FORW OP-BACK HALFSEXP)<br/>
<br/>
Skip over one sexp.<br/>
NEXT-TOKEN is a function of no argument that moves forward by one<br/>
token (after skipping comments if needed) and returns it.<br/>
NEXT-SEXP is a lower-level function to skip one sexp.<br/>
OP-FORW is the accessor to the forward level of the level data.<br/>
OP-BACK is the accessor to the backward level of the level data.<br/>
HALFSEXP if non-nil, means skip over a partial sexp if needed.  I.e. if the<br/>
first token we see is an operator, skip over its left-hand-side argument.<br/>
HALFSEXP can also be a token, in which case it means to parse as if<br/>
we had just successfully passed this token.<br/>
Possible return values:<br/>
  (FORW-LEVEL POS TOKEN): we couldn't skip TOKEN because its back-level<br/>
    is too high.  FORW-LEVEL is the forw-level of TOKEN,<br/>
    POS is its start position in the buffer.<br/>
  (t POS TOKEN): same thing when we bump on the wrong side of a paren.<br/>
    Instead of t, the `car' can also be some other non-nil non-number value.<br/>
  (nil POS TOKEN): we skipped over a paren-like pair.<br/>
  nil: we skipped over an identifier, matched parentheses, ...
