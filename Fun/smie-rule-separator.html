<strong>smie-rule-separator</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>smie.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(smie-rule-separator METHOD)<br/>
<br/>
Indent current token as a "separator".<br/>
By "separator", we mean here a token whose sole purpose is to separate<br/>
various elements within some enclosing syntactic construct, and which does<br/>
not have any semantic significance in itself (i.e. it would typically no exist<br/>
as a node in an abstract syntax tree).<br/>
Such a token is expected to have an associative syntax and be closely tied<br/>
to its syntactic parent.  Typical examples are "," in lists of arguments<br/>
(enclosed inside parentheses), or ";" in sequences of instructions (enclosed<br/>
in a {..} or begin..end block).<br/>
METHOD should be the method name that was passed to `smie-rules-function'.<br/>
Only meaningful when called from within `smie-rules-function'.
