</br>
(smie-rule-separator <u>METHOD</u>)</br>
</br>
Indent current token as a "separator".</br>
By "separator", we mean here a token whose sole purpose is to separate</br>
various elements within some enclosing syntactic construct, and which does</br>
not have any semantic significance in itself (i.e. it would typically no exist</br>
as a node in an abstract syntax tree).</br>
Such a token is expected to have an associative syntax and be closely tied</br>
to its syntactic parent.  Typical examples are "," in lists of arguments</br>
(enclosed inside parentheses), or ";" in sequences of instructions (enclosed</br>
in a {..} or begin..end block).</br>
<u>METHOD</u> should be the method name that was passed to `smie-rules-function'.</br>
Only meaningful when called from within `smie-rules-function'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
