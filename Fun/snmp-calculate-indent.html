snmp-calculate-indent is a compiled Lisp function in `snmp-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(snmp-calculate-indent)<br/><br/>Calculate the current line indentation in SNMP MIB code.<br/><br/>We use a very simple scheme: if the previous non-empty line was a "macro<br/>open" string, add `snmp-indent-level' to it.  If it was a "macro close"<br/>string, subtract `snmp-indent-level'.  Otherwise, use the same indentation<br/>as the previous non-empty line.  Note comments are considered empty<br/>lines for the purposes of this function.
