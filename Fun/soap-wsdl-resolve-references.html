<strong>soap-wsdl-resolve-references</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>soap-client.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(soap-wsdl-resolve-references <u>WSDL</u>)</br>
</br>
Resolve all references inside the <u>WSDL</u> structure.</br>
</br>
When the <u>WSDL</u> elements are created from the XML document, they</br>
refer to each other by name.  For example, the ELEMENT-TYPE slot</br>
of an SOAP-ARRAY-TYPE will contain the name of the element and</br>
the user would have to call `soap-wsdl-get' to obtain the actual</br>
element.</br>
</br>
After the entire document is loaded, we resolve all these</br>
references to the actual elements they refer to so that at</br>
runtime, we don't have to call `soap-wsdl-get' each time we</br>
traverse an element tree.
