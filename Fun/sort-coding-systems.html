<strong>sort-coding-systems</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>mule-cmds.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(sort-coding-systems <u>CODINGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Sort coding system list <u>CODINGS</u> by a priority of each coding system.</br>
Return the sorted list.  <u>CODINGS</u> is modified by side effects.</br>
</br>
If a coding system is most preferred, it has the highest priority.</br>
Otherwise, coding systems that correspond to MIME charsets have</br>
higher priorities.  Among them, a coding system included in the</br>
`coding-system' key of the current language environment has higher</br>
priority.  See also the documentation of `language-info-alist'.</br>
</br>
If the variable `sort-coding-systems-predicate' (which see) is</br>
non-nil, it is used to sort <u>CODINGS</u> instead.
