sort-coding-systems is a compiled Lisp function in `mule-cmds.el'.<br/><br/>(sort-coding-systems CODINGS)<br/><br/>Sort coding system list CODINGS by a priority of each coding system.<br/>Return the sorted list.  CODINGS is modified by side effects.<br/><br/>If a coding system is most preferred, it has the highest priority.<br/>Otherwise, coding systems that correspond to MIME charsets have<br/>higher priorities.  Among them, a coding system included in the<br/>`coding-system' key of the current language environment has higher<br/>priority.  See also the documentation of `language-info-alist'.<br/><br/>If the variable `sort-coding-systems-predicate' (which see) is<br/>non-nil, it is used to sort CODINGS instead.
