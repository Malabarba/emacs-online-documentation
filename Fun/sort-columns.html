sort-columns is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `sort.el'.<br/><br/>(sort-columns REVERSE &optional BEG END)<br/><br/>Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.<br/>For the purpose of this command, the region BEG...END includes<br/>the entire line that point is in and the entire line the mark is in.<br/>The column positions of point and mark bound the range of columns to sort on.<br/>A prefix argument means sort into REVERSE order.<br/>The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects<br/>the sort order.<br/><br/>Note that `sort-columns' rejects text that contains tabs,<br/>because tabs could be split across the specified columns<br/>and it doesn't know how to handle that.  Also, when possible,<br/>it uses the `sort' utility program, which doesn't understand tabs.<br/>Use M-x untabify to convert tabs to spaces before sorting.
