<strong>sort-columns</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>sort.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(sort-columns <u>REVERSE</u> &optional <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.</br>
For the purpose of this command, the region <u>BEG</u>...<u>END</u> includes</br>
the entire line that point is in and the entire line the mark is in.</br>
The column positions of point and mark bound the range of columns to sort on.</br>
A prefix argument means sort into <u>REVERSE</u> order.</br>
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects</br>
the sort order.</br>
</br>
Note that `sort-columns' rejects text that contains tabs,</br>
because tabs could be split across the specified columns</br>
and it doesn't know how to handle that.  Also, when possible,</br>
it uses the `sort' utility program, which doesn't understand tabs.</br>
Use M-x untabify to convert tabs to spaces before sorting.
