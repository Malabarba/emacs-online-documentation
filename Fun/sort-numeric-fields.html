</br>
Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.</br>
Fields are separated by whitespace and numbered from 1 up.</br>
Specified field must contain a number in each line of the region,</br>
which may begin with "0x" or "0" for hexadecimal and octal values.</br>
Otherwise, the number is interpreted according to sort-numeric-base.</br>
With a negative arg, sorts by the ARGth field counted from the right.</br>
Called from a program, there are three arguments:</br>
<u>FIELD</u>, <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u>.  <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> specify region to sort.
