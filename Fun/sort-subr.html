<strong>sort-subr</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>sort.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sort-subr REVERSE NEXTRECFUN ENDRECFUN &optional STARTKEYFUN ENDKEYFUN PREDICATE)<br/>
<br/>
General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.<br/>
<br/>
We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces<br/>
called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of<br/>
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the<br/>
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be<br/>
contiguous.<br/>
<br/>
Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.<br/>
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.<br/>
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects<br/>
the sort order.<br/>
<br/>
The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point<br/>
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within sort-subr.<br/>
<br/>
NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.<br/>
It moves point to the start of the next record.<br/>
It should move point to the end of the buffer if there are no more records.<br/>
The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when sort-subr<br/>
is called.<br/>
<br/>
ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.<br/>
It should move point to the end of the record.<br/>
<br/>
STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.<br/>
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or<br/>
else the key is the substring between the values of point after<br/>
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key<br/>
starts at the beginning of the record.<br/>
<br/>
ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the sort key to the end of the sort key.<br/>
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the<br/>
same as ENDRECFUN.<br/>
<br/>
PREDICATE, if non-nil, is the predicate function for comparing<br/>
keys; it is called with two arguments, the keys to compare, and<br/>
should return non-nil if the first key should sort before the<br/>
second key.  If PREDICATE is nil, comparison is done with `<' if<br/>
the keys are numbers, with `compare-buffer-substrings' if the<br/>
keys are cons cells (the car and cdr of each cons cell are taken<br/>
as start and end positions), and with `string<' otherwise.
