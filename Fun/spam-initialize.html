spam-initialize is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `spam.el'.<br/><br/>(spam-initialize &rest SYMBOLS)<br/><br/>Install the spam.el hooks and do other initialization.<br/>When SYMBOLS is given, set those variables to t.  This is so you<br/>can call `spam-initialize' before you set spam-use-* variables on<br/>explicitly, and matters only if you need the extra headers<br/>installed through `spam-necessary-extra-headers'.
