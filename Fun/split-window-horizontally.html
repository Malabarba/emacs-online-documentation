<strong>split-window-horizontally</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/split-window-right.html">split-window-right</a></strong>' in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(split-window-horizontally &optional <u>SIZE</u>)</br>
</br>
Split the selected window into two side-by-side windows.</br>
The selected window is on the left.  The newly split-off window</br>
is on the right and displays the same buffer.  Return the new</br>
window.</br>
</br>
If optional argument <u>SIZE</u> is omitted or nil, both windows get the</br>
same width, or close to it.  If <u>SIZE</u> is positive, the left-hand</br>
(selected) window gets <u>SIZE</u> columns.  If <u>SIZE</u> is negative, the</br>
right-hand (new) window gets -<u>SIZE</u> columns.  Here, <u>SIZE</u> includes</br>
the width of the window's scroll bar; if there are no scroll</br>
bars, it includes the width of the divider column to the window's</br>
right, if any.
