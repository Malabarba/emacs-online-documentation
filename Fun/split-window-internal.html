<strong>split-window-internal</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(split-window-internal OLD TOTAL-SIZE SIDE NORMAL-SIZE)<br/>
<br/>
Split window OLD.<br/>
Second argument TOTAL-SIZE specifies the number of lines or columns of the<br/>
new window.  In any case TOTAL-SIZE must be a positive integer.<br/>
<br/>
Third argument SIDE nil (or `below') specifies that the new window shall<br/>
be located below WINDOW.  SIDE `above' means the new window shall be<br/>
located above WINDOW.  In both cases TOTAL-SIZE specifies the number of<br/>
lines of the new window including space reserved for the mode and/or<br/>
header line.<br/>
<br/>
SIDE t (or `right') specifies that the new window shall be located on<br/>
the right side of WINDOW.  SIDE `left' means the new window shall be<br/>
located on the left of WINDOW.  In both cases TOTAL-SIZE specifies the<br/>
number of columns of the new window including space reserved for fringes<br/>
and the scrollbar or a divider column.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth argument NORMAL-SIZE specifies the normal size of the new window<br/>
according to the SIDE argument.<br/>
<br/>
The new total and normal sizes of all involved windows must have been<br/>
set correctly.  See the code of `split-window' for how this is done.
