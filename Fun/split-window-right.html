split-window-right is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x 3, <menu-bar> <file> <new-window-on-right>.<br/><br/>(split-window-right &optional SIZE)<br/><br/>Split the selected window into two side-by-side windows.<br/>The selected window is on the left.  The newly split-off window<br/>is on the right, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new<br/>window.<br/><br/>If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the<br/>same width, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the left-hand<br/>(selected) window gets SIZE columns.  If SIZE is negative, the<br/>right-hand (new) window gets -SIZE columns.  Here, SIZE includes<br/>the width of the window's scroll bar; if there are no scroll<br/>bars, it includes the width of the divider column to the window's<br/>right, if any.
