<strong>split-window-sensibly</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(split-window-sensibly &optional WINDOW)<br/>
<br/>
Split WINDOW in a way suitable for `display-buffer'.<br/>
WINDOW defaults to the currently selected window.<br/>
If `split-height-threshold' specifies an integer, WINDOW is at<br/>
least `split-height-threshold' lines tall and can be split<br/>
vertically, split WINDOW into two windows one above the other and<br/>
return the lower window.  Otherwise, if `split-width-threshold'<br/>
specifies an integer, WINDOW is at least `split-width-threshold'<br/>
columns wide and can be split horizontally, split WINDOW into two<br/>
windows side by side and return the window on the right.  If this<br/>
can't be done either and WINDOW is the only window on its frame,<br/>
try to split WINDOW vertically disregarding any value specified<br/>
by `split-height-threshold'.  If that succeeds, return the lower<br/>
window.  Return nil otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
By default `display-buffer' routines call this function to split<br/>
the largest or least recently used window.  To change the default<br/>
customize the option `split-window-preferred-function'.<br/>
<br/>
You can enforce this function to not split WINDOW horizontally,<br/>
by setting (or binding) the variable `split-width-threshold' to<br/>
nil.  If, in addition, you set `split-height-threshold' to zero,<br/>
chances increase that this function does split WINDOW vertically.<br/>
<br/>
In order to not split WINDOW vertically, set (or bind) the<br/>
variable `split-height-threshold' to nil.  Additionally, you can<br/>
set `split-width-threshold' to zero to make a horizontal split<br/>
more likely to occur.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at the function `window-splittable-p' if you want to<br/>
know how `split-window-sensibly' determines whether WINDOW can be<br/>
split.
