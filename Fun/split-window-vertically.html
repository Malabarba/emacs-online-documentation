<strong>split-window-vertically</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="split-window-below.html">split-window-below</a></strong>' in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(split-window-vertically &optional <u>SIZE</u>)</br>
</br>
Split the selected window into two windows, one above the other.</br>
The selected window is above.  The newly split-off window is</br>
below, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new window.</br>
</br>
If optional argument <u>SIZE</u> is omitted or nil, both windows get the</br>
same height, or close to it.  If <u>SIZE</u> is positive, the upper</br>
(selected) window gets <u>SIZE</u> lines.  If <u>SIZE</u> is negative, the</br>
lower (new) window gets -<u>SIZE</u> lines.</br>
</br>
If the variable `split-window-keep-point' is non-nil, both</br>
windows get the same value of point as the selected window.</br>
Otherwise, the window starts are chosen so as to minimize the</br>
amount of redisplay; this is convenient on slow terminals.
