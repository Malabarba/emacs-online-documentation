split-window-vertically is an alias for `split-window-below' in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(split-window-vertically &optional SIZE)<br/><br/>Split the selected window into two windows, one above the other.<br/>The selected window is above.  The newly split-off window is<br/>below, and displays the same buffer.  Return the new window.<br/><br/>If optional argument SIZE is omitted or nil, both windows get the<br/>same height, or close to it.  If SIZE is positive, the upper<br/>(selected) window gets SIZE lines.  If SIZE is negative, the<br/>lower (new) window gets -SIZE lines.<br/><br/>If the variable `split-window-keep-point' is non-nil, both<br/>windows get the same value of point as the selected window.<br/>Otherwise, the window starts are chosen so as to minimize the<br/>amount of redisplay; this is convenient on slow terminals.
