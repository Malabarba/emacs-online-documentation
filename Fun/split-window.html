<strong>split-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(split-window &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>SIZE</u> <u>SIDE</u> <u>PIXELWISE</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a new window adjacent to <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
Return the new window which is always a live window.</br>
</br>
Optional argument <u>SIZE</u> a positive number means make <u>WINDOW</u> <u>SIZE</u></br>
lines or columns tall.  If <u>SIZE</u> is negative, make the new window</br>
-<u>SIZE</u> lines or columns tall.  If and only if <u>SIZE</u> is non-nil, its</br>
absolute value can be less than `window-min-height' or</br>
`window-min-width'; so this command can make a new window as</br>
small as one line or two columns.  <u>SIZE</u> defaults to half of</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>'s size.</br>
</br>
Optional third argument <u>SIDE</u> nil (or `below') specifies that the</br>
new window shall be located below <u>WINDOW</u>.  <u>SIDE</u> `above' means the</br>
new window shall be located above <u>WINDOW</u>.  In both cases <u>SIZE</u></br>
specifies the new number of lines for <u>WINDOW</u> (or the new window</br>
if <u>SIZE</u> is negative) including space reserved for the mode and/or</br>
header line.</br>
</br>
<u>SIDE</u> t (or `right') specifies that the new window shall be</br>
located on the right side of <u>WINDOW</u>.  <u>SIDE</u> `left' means the new</br>
window shall be located on the left of <u>WINDOW</u>.  In both cases</br>
<u>SIZE</u> specifies the new number of columns for <u>WINDOW</u> (or the new</br>
window provided <u>SIZE</u> is negative) including space reserved for</br>
fringes and the scrollbar or a divider column.  Any other non-nil</br>
value for <u>SIDE</u> is currently handled like t (or `right').</br>
</br>
<u>PIXELWISE</u>, if non-nil, means to interpret <u>SIZE</u> pixelwise.</br>
</br>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the</br>
`split-window' parameter of <u>WINDOW</u> equals t, do not process any</br>
parameters of <u>WINDOW</u>.  Otherwise, if the `split-window' parameter</br>
of <u>WINDOW</u> specifies a function, call that function with all three</br>
arguments and return the value returned by that function.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, if <u>WINDOW</u> is part of an atomic window, "split" the</br>
root of that atomic window.  The new window does not become a</br>
member of that atomic window.</br>
</br>
If <u>WINDOW</u> is live, properties of the new window like margins and</br>
scrollbars are inherited from <u>WINDOW</u>.  If <u>WINDOW</u> is an internal</br>
window, these properties as well as the buffer displayed in the</br>
new window are inherited from the window selected on <u>WINDOW</u>'s</br>
frame.  The selected window is not changed by this function.
