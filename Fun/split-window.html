<strong>split-window</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(split-window &optional WINDOW SIZE SIDE)<br/>
<br/>
Make a new window adjacent to WINDOW.<br/>
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
Return the new window which is always a live window.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument SIZE a positive number means make WINDOW SIZE<br/>
lines or columns tall.  If SIZE is negative, make the new window<br/>
-SIZE lines or columns tall.  If and only if SIZE is non-nil, its<br/>
absolute value can be less than `window-min-height' or<br/>
`window-min-width'; so this command can make a new window as<br/>
small as one line or two columns.  SIZE defaults to half of<br/>
WINDOW's size.  Interactively, SIZE is the prefix argument.<br/>
<br/>
Optional third argument SIDE nil (or `below') specifies that the<br/>
new window shall be located below WINDOW.  SIDE `above' means the<br/>
new window shall be located above WINDOW.  In both cases SIZE<br/>
specifies the new number of lines for WINDOW (or the new window<br/>
if SIZE is negative) including space reserved for the mode and/or<br/>
header line.<br/>
<br/>
SIDE t (or `right') specifies that the new window shall be<br/>
located on the right side of WINDOW.  SIDE `left' means the new<br/>
window shall be located on the left of WINDOW.  In both cases<br/>
SIZE specifies the new number of columns for WINDOW (or the new<br/>
window provided SIZE is negative) including space reserved for<br/>
fringes and the scrollbar or a divider column.  Any other non-nil<br/>
value for SIDE is currently handled like t (or `right').<br/>
<br/>
If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the<br/>
`split-window' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not process any<br/>
parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the `split-window' parameter<br/>
of WINDOW specifies a function, call that function with all three<br/>
arguments and return the value returned by that function.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, "split" the<br/>
root of that atomic window.  The new window does not become a<br/>
member of that atomic window.<br/>
<br/>
If WINDOW is live, properties of the new window like margins and<br/>
scrollbars are inherited from WINDOW.  If WINDOW is an internal<br/>
window, these properties as well as the buffer displayed in the<br/>
new window are inherited from the window selected on WINDOW's<br/>
frame.  The selected window is not changed by this function.
