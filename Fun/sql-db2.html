<strong>sql-db2</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>sql.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sql-db2 &optional BUFFER)<br/>
<br/>
Run db2 by IBM as an inferior process.<br/>
<br/>
If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.<br/>
If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer<br/>
`*SQL*'.<br/>
<br/>
Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-db2-program'.  There is not<br/>
automatic login.<br/>
<br/>
The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending<br/>
input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.<br/>
<br/>
If you use M-x sql-accumulate-and-indent to send multiline commands to<br/>
db2, newlines will be escaped if necessary.  If you don't want that, set<br/>
`comint-input-sender' back to `comint-simple-send' by writing an after<br/>
advice.  See the elisp manual for more information.<br/>
<br/>
To set the buffer name directly, use C-u<br/>
before M-x sql-db2.  Once session has started,<br/>
M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the<br/>
buffer.<br/>
<br/>
To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters<br/>
in the input and output to the process, use C-x RET c<br/>
before M-x sql-db2.  You can also specify this with C-x RET p<br/>
in the SQL buffer, after you start the process.<br/>
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and<br/>
`default-process-coding-system'.<br/>
<br/>
(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)
