<strong>sql-help</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>sql.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(sql-help)<br/>
<br/>
Show short help for the SQL modes.<br/>
<br/>
Use an entry function to open an interactive SQL buffer.  This buffer is<br/>
usually named `*SQL*'.  The name of the major mode is SQLi.<br/>
<br/>
Use the following commands to start a specific SQL interpreter:<br/>
<br/>
    \\FREE<br/>
<br/>
Other non-free SQL implementations are also supported:<br/>
<br/>
    \\NONFREE<br/>
<br/>
But we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.<br/>
<br/>
You can also use M-x sql-product-interactive to invoke the<br/>
interpreter for the current `sql-product'.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the<br/>
buffer.  The output generated is appended to the buffer and a new prompt<br/>
is generated.  See the In/Out menu in the SQLi buffer for some functions<br/>
that help you navigate through the buffer, the input history, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a really complex SQL statement or if you are writing a<br/>
procedure, you can do this in a separate buffer.  Put the new buffer in<br/>
`sql-mode' by calling M-x sql-mode.  The name of this buffer can be<br/>
anything.  The name of the major mode is SQL.<br/>
<br/>
In this SQL buffer (SQL mode), you can send the region or the entire<br/>
buffer to the interactive SQL buffer (SQLi mode).  The results are<br/>
appended to the SQLi buffer without disturbing your SQL buffer.
