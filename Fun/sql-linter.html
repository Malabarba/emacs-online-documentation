sql-linter is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `sql.el'.<br/><br/>(sql-linter &optional BUFFER)<br/><br/>Run inl by RELEX as an inferior process.<br/><br/>If buffer `*SQL*' exists but no process is running, make a new process.<br/>If buffer exists and a process is running, just switch to buffer<br/>`*SQL*'.<br/><br/>Interpreter used comes from variable `sql-linter-program' - usually `inl'.<br/>Login uses the variables `sql-user', `sql-password', `sql-database' and<br/>`sql-server' as defaults, if set.  Additional command line parameters<br/>can be stored in the list `sql-linter-options'.  Run inl -h to get help on<br/>parameters.<br/><br/>`sql-database' is used to set the LINTER_MBX environment variable for<br/>local connections, `sql-server' refers to the server name from the<br/>`nodetab' file for the network connection (dbc_tcp or friends must run<br/>for this to work).  If `sql-password' is an empty string, inl will use<br/>an empty password.<br/><br/>The buffer is put in SQL interactive mode, giving commands for sending<br/>input.  See `sql-interactive-mode'.<br/><br/>To set the buffer name directly, use C-u<br/>before M-x sql-linter.  Once session has started,<br/>M-x sql-rename-buffer can be called separately to rename the<br/>buffer.<br/><br/>(Type C-h m in the SQL buffer for a list of commands.)
