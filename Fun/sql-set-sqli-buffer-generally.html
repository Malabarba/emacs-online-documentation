Set SQLi buffer for all SQL buffers that have none.</br>
This function checks all SQL buffers for their SQLi buffer.  If their</br>
SQLi buffer is nonexistent or has no process, it is set to the current</br>
default SQLi buffer.  The current default SQLi buffer is determined</br>
using `sql-find-sqli-buffer'.  If `sql-buffer' is set,</br>
`sql-set-sqli-hook' is run.
