<strong>standard-display-european</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>disp-table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(standard-display-european ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Semi-obsolete way to toggle display of ISO 8859 European characters.<br/>
<br/>
This function is semi-obsolete; you probably don't need it, or else you<br/>
probably should use `set-language-environment' or `set-locale-environment'.<br/>
<br/>
This function enables European character display if ARG is positive,<br/>
disables it if negative.  Otherwise, it toggles European character display.<br/>
<br/>
When this mode is enabled, characters in the range of 160 to 255<br/>
display not as octal escapes, but as accented characters.  Codes 146<br/>
and 160 display as apostrophe and space, even though they are not the<br/>
ASCII codes for apostrophe and space.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling European character display with this command noninteractively<br/>
from Lisp code also selects Latin-1 as the language environment.<br/>
This provides increased compatibility for users who call this function<br/>
in `.emacs'.
