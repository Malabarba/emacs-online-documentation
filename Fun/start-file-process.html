start-file-process is a compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>(start-file-process NAME BUFFER PROGRAM &rest PROGRAM-ARGS)<br/><br/>Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.<br/><br/>Similar to `start-process', but may invoke a file handler based on<br/>`default-directory'.  See Info node `(elisp)Magic File Names'.<br/><br/>This handler ought to run PROGRAM, perhaps on the local host,<br/>perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to `default-directory'.<br/>In the latter case, the local part of `default-directory' becomes<br/>the working directory of the process.<br/><br/>PROGRAM and PROGRAM-ARGS might be file names.  They are not<br/>objects of file handler invocation.  File handlers might not<br/>support pty association, if PROGRAM is nil.
