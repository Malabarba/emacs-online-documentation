<strong>start-file-process</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(start-file-process <u>NAME</u> <u>BUFFER</u> <u>PROGRAM</u> &rest <u>PROGRAM-ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.</br>
</br>
Similar to `start-process', but may invoke a file handler based on</br>
`default-directory'.  See Info node `(elisp)Magic File Names'.</br>
</br>
This handler ought to run <u>PROGRAM</u>, perhaps on the local host,</br>
perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to `default-directory'.</br>
In the latter case, the local part of `default-directory' becomes</br>
the working directory of the process.</br>
</br>
<u>PROGRAM</u> and <u>PROGRAM-ARGS</u> might be file names.  They are not</br>
objects of file handler invocation.  File handlers might not</br>
support pty association, if <u>PROGRAM</u> is nil.
