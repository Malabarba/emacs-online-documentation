<strong>start-process-shell-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(start-process-shell-command <u>NAME</u> <u>BUFFER</u> <u>COMMAND</u>)</br>
</br>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.</br>
<u>NAME</u> is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.</br>
<u>BUFFER</u> is the buffer (or buffer name) to associate with the process.</br>
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify</br>
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.</br>
 <u>BUFFER</u> may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated</br>
 with any buffer</br>
<u>COMMAND</u> is the shell command to run.</br>
</br>
An old calling convention accepted any number of arguments after <u>COMMAND</u>,</br>
which were just concatenated to <u>COMMAND</u>.  This is still supported but strongly</br>
discouraged.
