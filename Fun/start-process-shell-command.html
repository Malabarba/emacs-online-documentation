<strong>start-process-shell-command</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(start-process-shell-command NAME BUFFER COMMAND)<br/>
<br/>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.<br/>
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.<br/>
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer name) to associate with the process.<br/>
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify<br/>
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.<br/>
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated<br/>
 with any buffer<br/>
COMMAND is the shell command to run.<br/>
<br/>
An old calling convention accepted any number of arguments after COMMAND,<br/>
which were just concatenated to COMMAND.  This is still supported but strongly<br/>
discouraged.
