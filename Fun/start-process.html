<strong>start-process</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(start-process <u>NAME</u> <u>BUFFER</u> <u>PROGRAM</u> &rest <u>PROGRAM-ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.</br>
<u>NAME</u> is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.</br>
<u>BUFFER</u> is the buffer (or buffer name) to associate with the process.</br>
</br>
Process output (both standard output and standard error streams) goes</br>
at end of <u>BUFFER</u>, unless you specify an output stream or filter</br>
function to handle the output.  <u>BUFFER</u> may also be nil, meaning that</br>
this process is not associated with any buffer.</br>
</br>
<u>PROGRAM</u> is the program file name.  It is searched for in `exec-path'</br>
(which see).  If nil, just associate a pty with the buffer.  Remaining</br>
arguments are strings to give program as arguments.</br>
</br>
If you want to separate standard output from standard error, invoke</br>
the command through a shell and redirect one of them using the shell</br>
syntax.
