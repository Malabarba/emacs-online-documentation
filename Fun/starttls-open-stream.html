starttls-open-stream is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `starttls.el'.<br/><br/>(starttls-open-stream NAME BUFFER HOST PORT)<br/><br/>Open a TLS connection for a port to a host.<br/>Returns a subprocess object to represent the connection.<br/>Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.<br/>Args are NAME BUFFER HOST PORT.<br/>NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.<br/>BUFFER is the buffer (or `buffer-name') to associate with the process.<br/> Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify<br/> an output stream or filter function to handle the output.<br/> BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated<br/> with any buffer<br/>Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.<br/>Fourth arg PORT is an integer specifying a port to connect to.<br/>If `starttls-use-gnutls' is nil, this may also be a service name, but<br/>GnuTLS requires a port number.
