string-make-multibyte is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(string-make-multibyte STRING)<br/><br/>Return the multibyte equivalent of STRING.<br/>If STRING is unibyte and contains non-ASCII characters, the function<br/>`unibyte-char-to-multibyte' is used to convert each unibyte character<br/>to a multibyte character.  In this case, the returned string is a<br/>newly created string with no text properties.  If STRING is multibyte<br/>or entirely ASCII, it is returned unchanged.  In particular, when<br/>STRING is unibyte and entirely ASCII, the returned string is unibyte.<br/>(When the characters are all ASCII, Emacs primitives will treat the<br/>string the same way whether it is unibyte or multibyte.)
