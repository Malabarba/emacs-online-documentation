<strong>string-to-int</strong> is an alias for `string-to-number' in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(string-to-int STRING &optional BASE)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>
use `string-to-number' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Parse STRING as a decimal number and return the number.<br/>
This parses both integers and floating point numbers.<br/>
It ignores leading spaces and tabs, and all trailing chars.<br/>
<br/>
If BASE, interpret STRING as a number in that base.  If BASE isn't<br/>
present, base 10 is used.  BASE must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive).<br/>
If the base used is not 10, STRING is always parsed as integer.
