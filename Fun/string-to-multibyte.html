<strong>string-to-multibyte</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(string-to-multibyte STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual chars as STRING.<br/>
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.<br/>
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.<br/>
<br/>
If STRING is unibyte and contains an 8-bit byte, it is converted to<br/>
the corresponding multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.<br/>
<br/>
This differs from `string-as-multibyte' by converting each byte of a correct<br/>
utf-8 sequence to an eight-bit character, not just bytes that don't form a<br/>
correct sequence.
