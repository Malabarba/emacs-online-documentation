<strong>string-to-multibyte</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(string-to-multibyte <u>STRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a multibyte string with the same individual chars as <u>STRING</u>.</br>
If <u>STRING</u> is multibyte, the result is <u>STRING</u> itself.</br>
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.</br>
</br>
If <u>STRING</u> is unibyte and contains an 8-bit byte, it is converted to</br>
the corresponding multibyte character of charset `eight-bit'.</br>
</br>
This differs from `string-as-multibyte' by converting each byte of a correct</br>
utf-8 sequence to an eight-bit character, not just bytes that don't form a</br>
correct sequence.
