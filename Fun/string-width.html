<strong>string-width</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(string-width STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Return width of STRING when displayed in the current buffer.<br/>
Width is measured by how many columns it occupies on the screen.<br/>
When calculating width of a multibyte character in STRING,<br/>
only the base leading-code is considered; the validity of<br/>
the following bytes is not checked.  Tabs in STRING are always<br/>
taken to occupy `tab-width' columns.
