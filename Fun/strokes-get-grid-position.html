<br/>
(strokes-get-grid-position STROKE-EXTENT POSITION &optional GRID-RESOLUTION)<br/>
<br/>
Map POSITION to a new grid position.<br/>
Do so based on its STROKE-EXTENT and GRID-RESOLUTION.<br/>
STROKE-EXTENT as a list ((XMIN . YMIN) (XMAX . YMAX)).<br/>
If POSITION is a `strokes-lift', then it is itself returned.<br/>
Optional GRID-RESOLUTION may be used in place of `strokes-grid-resolution'.<br/>
The grid is a square whose dimension is [0,GRID-RESOLUTION).
