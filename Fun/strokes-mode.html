Strokes are pictographic mouse gestures which invoke commands.<br/>
Strokes are invoked with <S-down-mouse-2>.  You can define<br/>
new strokes with M-x strokes-global-set-stroke.  See also<br/>
<M-down-mouse-2> for `complex' strokes.<br/>
<br/>
To use strokes for pictographic editing, such as Chinese/Japanese, use<br/>
M-x strokes-compose-complex-stroke, which draws strokes and inserts them.<br/>
Encode/decode your strokes with M-x strokes-encode-buffer,<br/>
M-x strokes-decode-buffer.<br/>
