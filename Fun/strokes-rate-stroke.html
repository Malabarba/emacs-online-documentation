<strong>strokes-rate-stroke</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>strokes.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(strokes-rate-stroke <u>STROKE1</u> <u>STROKE2</u>)</br>
</br>
Rate <u>STROKE1</u> with <u>STROKE2</u> and return a score based on a distance metric.</br>
Note: the rating is an error rating, and therefore, a return of 0</br>
represents a perfect match.  Also note that the order of stroke</br>
arguments is order-independent for the algorithm used here.
