(strokes-read-complex-stroke &optional PROMPT EVENT)<br/>
<br/>
Read a complex stroke (interactively) and return the stroke.<br/>
Optional PROMPT in minibuffer displays before and during stroke reading.<br/>
Note that a complex stroke allows the user to pen-up and pen-down.  This<br/>

then complete the stroke with button 3.<br/>
Optional EVENT is acceptable as the starting event of the stroke.
