<strong>strokes-xpm-for-stroke</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>strokes.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(strokes-xpm-for-stroke &optional STROKE BUFNAME B/W-ONLY)<br/>
<br/>
Create an XPM pixmap for the given STROKE in buffer ` *strokes-xpm*'.<br/>
If STROKE is not supplied, then `strokes-last-stroke' will be used.<br/>
Optional BUFNAME to name something else.<br/>
The pixmap will contain time information via rainbow dot colors<br/>
where each individual strokes begins.<br/>
Optional B/W-ONLY non-nil will create a mono pixmap, not intended<br/>
for trying to figure out the order of strokes, but rather for reading<br/>
the stroke as a character in some language.
