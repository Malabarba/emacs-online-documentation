<strong>substitute-command-keys</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(substitute-command-keys STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Substitute key descriptions for command names in STRING.<br/>
Each substring of the form \[COMMAND] is replaced by either a<br/>
keystroke sequence that invokes COMMAND, or "M-x COMMAND" if COMMAND<br/>
is not on any keys.<br/>
<br/>
Each substring of the form \{MAPVAR} is replaced by a summary of<br/>
the value of MAPVAR as a keymap.  This summary is similar to the one<br/>
produced by `describe-bindings'.  The summary ends in two newlines<br/>
(used by the helper function `help-make-xrefs' to find the end of the<br/>
summary).<br/>
<br/>
Each substring of the form \<MAPVAR> specifies the use of MAPVAR<br/>
as the keymap for future \[COMMAND] substrings.<br/>
\= quotes the following character and is discarded;<br/>
thus, \=\= puts \= into the output, and \=\[ puts \[ into the output.<br/>
<br/>
Return the original STRING if no substitutions are made.<br/>
Otherwise, return a new string, without any text properties.
