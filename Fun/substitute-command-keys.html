<strong>substitute-command-keys</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(substitute-command-keys <u>STRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Substitute key descriptions for command names in <u>STRING</u>.</br>
Each substring of the form \[COMMAND] is replaced by either a</br>
keystroke sequence that invokes COMMAND, or "M-x COMMAND" if COMMAND</br>
is not on any keys.</br>
</br>
Each substring of the form \{MAPVAR} is replaced by a summary of</br>
the value of MAPVAR as a keymap.  This summary is similar to the one</br>
produced by `describe-bindings'.  The summary ends in two newlines</br>
(used by the helper function `help-make-xrefs' to find the end of the</br>
summary).</br>
</br>
Each substring of the form \&lt;MAPVAR> specifies the use of MAPVAR</br>
as the keymap for future \[COMMAND] substrings.</br>
\= quotes the following character and is discarded;</br>
thus, \=\= puts \= into the output, and \=\[ puts \[ into the output.</br>
</br>
Return the original <u>STRING</u> if no substitutions are made.</br>
Otherwise, return a new string, without any text properties.
