substitute-key-definition is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(substitute-key-definition OLDDEF NEWDEF KEYMAP &optional OLDMAP)<br/><br/>Replace OLDDEF with NEWDEF for any keys in KEYMAP now defined as OLDDEF.<br/>In other words, OLDDEF is replaced with NEWDEF where ever it appears.<br/>Alternatively, if optional fourth argument OLDMAP is specified, we redefine<br/>in KEYMAP as NEWDEF those keys which are defined as OLDDEF in OLDMAP.<br/><br/>If you don't specify OLDMAP, you can usually get the same results<br/>in a cleaner way with command remapping, like this:<br/>  (define-key KEYMAP [remap OLDDEF] NEWDEF)
