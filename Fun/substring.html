<strong>substring</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(substring STRING FROM &optional TO)<br/>
<br/>
Return a new string whose contents are a substring of STRING.<br/>
The returned string consists of the characters between index FROM<br/>
(inclusive) and index TO (exclusive) of STRING.  FROM and TO are<br/>
zero-indexed: 0 means the first character of STRING.  Negative values<br/>
are counted from the end of STRING.  If TO is nil, the substring runs<br/>
to the end of STRING.<br/>
<br/>
The STRING argument may also be a vector.  In that case, the return<br/>
value is a new vector that contains the elements between index FROM<br/>
(inclusive) and index TO (exclusive) of that vector argument.
