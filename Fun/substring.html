<strong>substring</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(substring <u>STRING</u> &optional <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a new string whose contents are a substring of <u>STRING</u>.</br>
The returned string consists of the characters between index <u>FROM</u></br>
(inclusive) and index <u>TO</u> (exclusive) of <u>STRING</u>.  <u>FROM</u> and <u>TO</u> are</br>
zero-indexed: 0 means the first character of <u>STRING</u>.  Negative values</br>
are counted from the end of <u>STRING</u>.  If <u>TO</u> is nil, the substring runs</br>
to the end of <u>STRING</u>.</br>
</br>
The <u>STRING</u> argument may also be a vector.  In that case, the return</br>
value is a new vector that contains the elements between index <u>FROM</u></br>
(inclusive) and index <u>TO</u> (exclusive) of that vector argument.</br>
</br>
With one argument, just copy <u>STRING</u> (with properties, if any).
