<strong>suspend-emacs</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(suspend-emacs &optional <u>STUFFSTRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Stop Emacs and return to superior process.  You can resume later.</br>
If `cannot-suspend' is non-nil, or if the system doesn't support job</br>
control, run a subshell instead.</br>
</br>
If optional arg <u>STUFFSTRING</u> is non-nil, its characters are stuffed</br>
to be read as terminal input by Emacs's parent, after suspension.</br>
</br>
Before suspending, run the normal hook `suspend-hook'.</br>
After resumption run the normal hook `suspend-resume-hook'.</br>
</br>
Some operating systems cannot stop the Emacs process and resume it later.</br>
On such systems, Emacs starts a subshell instead of suspending.
