<strong>suspend-tty</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(suspend-tty &optional <u>TTY</u>)</br>
</br>
Suspend the terminal device <u>TTY</u>.</br>
</br>
The device is restored to its default state, and Emacs ceases all</br>
access to the tty device.  Frames that use the device are not deleted,</br>
but input is not read from them and if they change, their display is</br>
not updated.</br>
</br>
<u>TTY</u> may be a terminal object, a frame, or nil for the terminal device</br>
of the currently selected frame.</br>
</br>
This function runs `suspend-tty-functions' after suspending the</br>
device.  The functions are run with one arg, the id of the suspended</br>
terminal device.</br>
</br>
`suspend-tty' does nothing if it is called on a device that is already</br>
suspended.</br>
</br>
A suspended tty may be resumed by calling `resume-tty' on it.
