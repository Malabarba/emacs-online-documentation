<strong>switch-to-buffer-other-window</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x 4 b.<br/>
<br/>
(switch-to-buffer-other-window BUFFER-OR-NAME &optional NORECORD)<br/>
<br/>
Select the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME in another window.<br/>
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or<br/>
nil.  Return the buffer switched to.<br/>
<br/>
If called interactively, prompt for the buffer name using the<br/>
minibuffer.  The variable `confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer'<br/>
determines whether to request confirmation before creating a new<br/>
buffer.<br/>
<br/>
If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and does not identify an existing<br/>
buffer, create a new buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is<br/>
nil, switch to the buffer returned by `other-buffer'.<br/>
<br/>
Optional second argument NORECORD non-nil means do not put this<br/>
buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.<br/>
<br/>
This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its<br/>
documentation for additional customization information.
