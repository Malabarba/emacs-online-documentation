<strong>switch-to-prev-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(switch-to-prev-buffer &optional WINDOW BURY-OR-KILL)<br/>
<br/>
In WINDOW switch to previous buffer.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
Return the buffer switched to, nil if no suitable buffer could be<br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument BURY-OR-KILL non-nil means the buffer currently<br/>
shown in WINDOW is about to be buried or killed and consequently<br/>
shall not be switched to in future invocations of this command.<br/>
<br/>
As a special case, if BURY-OR-KILL equals `append', this means to<br/>
move the buffer to the end of WINDOW's previous buffers list so a<br/>
future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' less likely switches<br/>
to it.
