<strong>switch-to-prev-buffer</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(switch-to-prev-buffer &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>BURY-OR-KILL</u>)</br>
</br>
In <u>WINDOW</u> switch to previous buffer.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
Return the buffer switched to, nil if no suitable buffer could be</br>
found.</br>
</br>
Optional argument <u>BURY-OR-KILL</u> non-nil means the buffer currently</br>
shown in <u>WINDOW</u> is about to be buried or killed and consequently</br>
shall not be switched to in future invocations of this command.</br>
</br>
As a special case, if <u>BURY-OR-KILL</u> equals `append', this means to</br>
move the buffer to the end of <u>WINDOW</u>'s previous buffers list so a</br>
future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' less likely switches</br>
to it.
