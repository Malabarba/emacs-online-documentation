<strong>syntax-ppss-toplevel-pos</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>syntax.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(syntax-ppss-toplevel-pos <u>PPSS</u>)</br>
</br>
Get the latest syntactically outermost position found in a syntactic scan.</br>
<u>PPSS</u> is a scan state, as returned by `parse-partial-sexp' or `syntax-ppss'.</br>
An "outermost position" means one that it is outside of any syntactic entity:</br>
outside of any parentheses, comments, or strings encountered in the scan.</br>
If no such position is recorded in <u>PPSS</u> (because the end of the scan was</br>
itself at the outermost level), return nil.
