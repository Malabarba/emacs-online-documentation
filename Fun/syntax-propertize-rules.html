<!DOCTYPE html><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en-us"><head><style type="text/css"> @import url('http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual.css');</style></head><body style="padding:1rem;"><strong>syntax-propertize-rules</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>syntax.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(syntax-propertize-rules &rest <u>RULES</u>)</br>
</br>
Make a function that applies <u>RULES</u> for use in `syntax-propertize-function'.</br>
The function will scan the buffer, applying the rules where they match.</br>
The buffer is scanned a single time, like "lex" would, rather than once</br>
per rule.</br>
</br>
Each RULE can be a symbol, in which case that symbol's value should be,</br>
at macro-expansion time, a precompiled set of rules, as returned</br>
by `syntax-propertize-precompile-rules'.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, RULE should have the form (REGEXP HIGHLIGHT1 ... HIGHLIGHTn), where</br>
REGEXP is an expression (evaluated at time of macro-expansion) that returns</br>
a regexp, and where HIGHLIGHTs have the form (NUMBER SYNTAX) which means to</br>
apply the property SYNTAX to the chars matched by the subgroup NUMBER</br>
of the regular expression, if NUMBER did match.</br>
SYNTAX is an expression that returns a value to apply as `syntax-table'</br>
property.  Some expressions are handled specially:</br>
- if SYNTAX is a string, then it is converted with `string-to-syntax';</br>
- if SYNTAX has the form (prog1 EXP . EXPS) then the value returned by EXP</br>
  will be applied to the buffer before running EXPS and if EXP is a string it</br>
  is also converted with `string-to-syntax'.</br>
The SYNTAX expression is responsible to save the `match-data' if needed</br>
for subsequent HIGHLIGHTs.</br>
Also SYNTAX is free to move point, in which case <u>RULES</u> may not be applied to</br>
some parts of the text or may be applied several times to other parts.</br>
</br>
Note: back-references in REGEXPs do not work.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
