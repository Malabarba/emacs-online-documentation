<strong>syntax-propertize-rules</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>syntax.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(syntax-propertize-rules &rest RULES)<br/>
<br/>
Make a function that applies RULES for use in `syntax-propertize-function'.<br/>
The function will scan the buffer, applying the rules where they match.<br/>
The buffer is scanned a single time, like "lex" would, rather than once<br/>
per rule.<br/>
<br/>
Each RULE can be a symbol, in which case that symbol's value should be,<br/>
at macro-expansion time, a precompiled set of rules, as returned<br/>
by `syntax-propertize-precompile-rules'.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, RULE should have the form (REGEXP HIGHLIGHT1 ... HIGHLIGHTn), where<br/>
REGEXP is an expression (evaluated at time of macro-expansion) that returns<br/>
a regexp, and where HIGHLIGHTs have the form (NUMBER SYNTAX) which means to<br/>
apply the property SYNTAX to the chars matched by the subgroup NUMBER<br/>
of the regular expression, if NUMBER did match.<br/>
SYNTAX is an expression that returns a value to apply as `syntax-table'<br/>
property.  Some expressions are handled specially:<br/>
- if SYNTAX is a string, then it is converted with `string-to-syntax';<br/>
- if SYNTAX has the form (prog1 EXP . EXPS) then the value returned by EXP<br/>
  will be applied to the buffer before running EXPS and if EXP is a string it<br/>
  is also converted with `string-to-syntax'.<br/>
The SYNTAX expression is responsible to save the `match-data' if needed<br/>
for subsequent HIGHLIGHTs.<br/>
Also SYNTAX is free to move point, in which case RULES may not be applied to<br/>
some parts of the text or may be applied several times to other parts.<br/>
<br/>
Note: back-references in REGEXPs do not work.
