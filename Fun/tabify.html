<strong>tabify</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>tabify.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(tabify START END)<br/>
<br/>
Convert multiple spaces in region to tabs when possible.<br/>
A group of spaces is partially replaced by tabs<br/>
when this can be done without changing the column they end at.<br/>
Called non-interactively, the region is specified by arguments<br/>
START and END, rather than by the position of point and mark.<br/>
The variable `tab-width' controls the spacing of tab stops.
