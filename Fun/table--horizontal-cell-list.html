<strong>table--horizontal-cell-list</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(table--horizontal-cell-list &optional LEFT-TO-RIGHT FIRST-ONLY PIVOT INTERNAL-DIR INTERNAL-LIST INTERNAL-PY)<br/>
<br/>
Return a horizontal cell list from the table.<br/>
The return value represents a list of cells including the current cell<br/>
that align horizontally.  Each element of the list is a cons cells (lu<br/>
. rb) where lu is the cell's left upper location and rb is the cell's<br/>
right bottom location.  The cell order in the list is from right to<br/>
left of the table.  If optional argument LEFT-TO-RIGHT is non-nil the<br/>
order is reversed as from left to right of the table.  If optional<br/>
argument FIRST-ONLY is non-nil the return value is not a list of cells<br/>
but a single cons cell that is the first cell of the list, if the<br/>
list had been created.  If optional argument PIVOT is a symbol `top'<br/>
the horizontal cell search is aligned with the top edge of the current<br/>
cell, otherwise aligned with the bottom edge of the current cell.  The<br/>
arguments INTERNAL-DIR, INTERNAL-LIST and INTERNAL-PY are internal use<br/>
only and must not be specified.
