<strong>table--untabify-line</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(table--untabify-line &optional FROM)<br/>
<br/>
Untabify current line.<br/>
Unlike save-excursion this guarantees preserving the cursor location<br/>
even when the point is on a tab character which is to be removed.<br/>
Optional FROM narrows the subject operation from this point to the end<br/>
of line.
