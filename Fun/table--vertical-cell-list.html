table--vertical-cell-list is a compiled Lisp function in `table.el'.<br/><br/>(table--vertical-cell-list &optional TOP-TO-BOTTOM FIRST-ONLY PIVOT INTERNAL-DIR INTERNAL-LIST INTERNAL-PX)<br/><br/>Return a vertical cell list from the table.<br/>The return value represents a list of cells including the current cell<br/>that align vertically.  Each element of the list is a cons cell (lu<br/>. rb) where lu is the cell's left upper location and rb is the cell's<br/>right bottom location.  The cell order in the list is from bottom to<br/>top of the table.  If optional argument TOP-TO-BOTTOM is non-nil the<br/>order is reversed as from top to bottom of the table.  If optional<br/>argument FIRST-ONLY is non-nil the return value is not a list of cells<br/>but a single cons cell that is the first cell of the list, if the list<br/>had been created.  If optional argument PIVOT is a symbol `left' the<br/>vertical cell search is aligned with the left edge of the current<br/>cell, otherwise aligned with the right edge of the current cell.  The<br/>arguments INTERNAL-DIR, INTERNAL-LIST and INTERNAL-PX are internal use<br/>only and must not be specified.
