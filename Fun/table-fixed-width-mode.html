table-fixed-width-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `table.el'.<br/><br/>(table-fixed-width-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Cell width is fixed when this is non-nil.<br/>Normally it should be nil for allowing automatic cell width expansion<br/>that widens a cell when it is necessary.  When non-nil, typing in a<br/>cell does not automatically expand the cell width.  A word that is too<br/>long to fit in a cell is chopped into multiple lines.  The chopped<br/>location is indicated by `table-word-continuation-char'.  This<br/>variable's value can be toggled by M-x table-fixed-width-mode at<br/>run-time.
