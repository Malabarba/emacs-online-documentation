<strong>table-shorten-cell</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(table-shorten-cell N)<br/>
<br/>
Shorten the current cell by N lines by shrinking the cell vertically.<br/>
Shortening is done by removing blank lines from the bottom of the cell<br/>
and possibly from the top of the cell as well.  Therefore, the cell<br/>
must have some bottom/top blank lines to be shorten effectively.  This<br/>
is applicable to all the cells aligned horizontally with the current<br/>
one because they are also shortened in order to keep the rectangular<br/>
table structure.
