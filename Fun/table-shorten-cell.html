<strong>table-shorten-cell</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>table.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(table-shorten-cell <u>N</u>)</br>
</br>
Shorten the current cell by <u>N</u> lines by shrinking the cell vertically.</br>
Shortening is done by removing blank lines from the bottom of the cell</br>
and possibly from the top of the cell as well.  Therefore, the cell</br>
must have some bottom/top blank lines to be shorten effectively.  This</br>
is applicable to all the cells aligned horizontally with the current</br>
one because they are also shortened in order to keep the rectangular</br>
table structure.
