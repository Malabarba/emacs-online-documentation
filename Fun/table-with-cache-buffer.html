<strong>table-with-cache-buffer</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>table.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(table-with-cache-buffer &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Execute the forms in BODY with table cache buffer as the current buffer.<br/>
This macro simplifies the rest of the work greatly by condensing the<br/>
common idiom used in many of the cell manipulation functions.  It does<br/>
not return any meaningful value.<br/>
<br/>
Save the current buffer and set the cache buffer as the current<br/>
buffer.  Move the point to the cache buffer coordinate<br/>
`table-cell-cache-point-coordinate'.  After BODY forms are executed,<br/>
the paragraph is filled as long as `table-inhibit-auto-fill-paragraph'<br/>
remains nil.  BODY can set it to t when it does not want to fill the<br/>
paragraph.  If necessary the cell width and height are extended as the<br/>
consequence of cell content modification by the BODY.  Then the<br/>
current buffer is restored to the original one.  The last cache point<br/>
coordinate is stored in `table-cell-cache-point-coordinate'.  The<br/>
original buffer's point is moved to the location that corresponds to<br/>
the last cache point coordinate.
