</br>
(table-with-cache-buffer &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute the forms in <u>BODY</u> with table cache buffer as the current buffer.</br>
This macro simplifies the rest of the work greatly by condensing the</br>
common idiom used in many of the cell manipulation functions.  It does</br>
not return any meaningful value.</br>
</br>
Save the current buffer and set the cache buffer as the current</br>
buffer.  Move the point to the cache buffer coordinate</br>
`table-cell-cache-point-coordinate'.  After <u>BODY</u> forms are executed,</br>
the paragraph is filled as long as `table-inhibit-auto-fill-paragraph'</br>
remains nil.  <u>BODY</u> can set it to t when it does not want to fill the</br>
paragraph.  If necessary the cell width and height are extended as the</br>
consequence of cell content modification by the <u>BODY</u>.  Then the</br>
current buffer is restored to the original one.  The last cache point</br>
coordinate is stored in `table-cell-cache-point-coordinate'.  The</br>
original buffer's point is moved to the location that corresponds to</br>
the last cache point coordinate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
