<strong>tabulated-list-set-col</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>tabulated-list.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(tabulated-list-set-col <u>COL</u> <u>DESC</u> &optional <u>CHANGE-ENTRY-DATA</u>)</br>
</br>
Change the Tabulated List entry at point, setting <u>COL</u> to <u>DESC</u>.</br>
<u>COL</u> is the column number to change, or the name of the column to change.</br>
<u>DESC</u> is the new column descriptor, which is inserted via</br>
`tabulated-list-print-col'.</br>
</br>
If <u>CHANGE-ENTRY-DATA</u> is non-nil, modify the underlying entry data</br>
by setting the appropriate slot of the vector originally used to</br>
print this entry.  If `tabulated-list-entries' has a list value,</br>
this is the vector stored within it.
