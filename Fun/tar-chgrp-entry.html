<strong>tar-chgrp-entry</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>tar-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(tar-chgrp-entry <u>NEW-GID</u>)</br>
</br>
Change the group-id associated with this entry in the tar file.</br>
If this tar file was written by GNU tar, then you will be able to edit</br>
the group id as a string; otherwise, you must edit it as a number.</br>
You can force editing as a number by calling this with a prefix arg.</br>
This does not modify the disk image; you must save the tar file itself</br>
for this to be permanent.
