<strong>tcl-beginning-of-defun</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="beginning-of-defun">beginning-of-defun</a></strong>' in `<code>tcl.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(tcl-beginning-of-defun &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Move backward to the beginning of a defun.</br>
With <u>ARG</u>, do it that many times.  Negative <u>ARG</u> means move forward</br>
to the <u>ARG</u>th following beginning of defun.</br>
</br>
If search is successful, return t; point ends up at the beginning</br>
of the line where the search succeeded.  Otherwise, return nil.</br>
</br>
When `open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' is non-nil, a defun</br>
is assumed to start where there is a char with open-parenthesis</br>
syntax at the beginning of a line.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' is</br>
non-nil, then a string which matches that regexp may also precede</br>
the open-parenthesis.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' and</br>
`open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' are both nil, this</br>
function instead finds an open-paren at the outermost level.</br>
</br>
If the variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its</br>
value is called as a function, with argument <u>ARG</u>, to find the</br>
defun's beginning.</br>
</br>
Regardless of the values of `defun-prompt-regexp' and</br>
`beginning-of-defun-function', point always moves to the</br>
beginning of the line whenever the search is successful.
