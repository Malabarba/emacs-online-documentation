<br/>
(tcl-end-of-defun &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Move forward to next end of defun.<br/>
With argument, do it that many times.<br/>
Negative argument -N means move back to Nth preceding end of defun.<br/>
<br/>
An end of a defun occurs right after the close-parenthesis that<br/>
matches the open-parenthesis that starts a defun; see function<br/>
`beginning-of-defun'.<br/>

If variable `end-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value<br/>
is called as a function to find the defun's end.
