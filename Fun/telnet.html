<strong>telnet</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>telnet.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(telnet <u>HOST</u> &optional <u>PORT</u>)</br>
</br>
Open a network login connection to host named <u>HOST</u> (a string).</br>
Optional arg <u>PORT</u> specifies alternative port to connect to.</br>
Interactively, use C-u prefix to be prompted for port number.</br>
</br>
Communication with <u>HOST</u> is recorded in a buffer `*PROGRAM-HOST*'</br>
where PROGRAM is the telnet program being used.  This program</br>
is controlled by the contents of the global variable `telnet-host-properties',</br>
falling back on the value of the global variable `telnet-program'.</br>
Normally input is edited in Emacs and sent a line at a time.
