<strong>temp-buffer-resize-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>help.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(temp-buffer-resize-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle auto-resizing temporary buffer windows (Temp Buffer Resize Mode).<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Temp Buffer Resize mode if ARG<br/>
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,<br/>
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/>
<br/>
When Temp Buffer Resize mode is enabled, the windows in which we<br/>
show a temporary buffer are automatically resized in height to<br/>
fit the buffer's contents, but never more than<br/>
`temp-buffer-max-height' nor less than `window-min-height'.<br/>
<br/>
A window is resized only if it has been specially created for the<br/>
buffer.  Windows that have shown another buffer before are not<br/>
resized.  A frame is resized only if `fit-frame-to-buffer' is<br/>
non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
This mode is used by `help', `apropos' and `completion' buffers,<br/>
and some others.
