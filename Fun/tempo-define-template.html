tempo-define-template is a compiled Lisp function in `tempo.el'.<br/><br/>(tempo-define-template NAME ELEMENTS &optional TAG DOCUMENTATION TAGLIST)<br/><br/>Define a template.<br/>This function creates a template variable `tempo-template-NAME' and an<br/>interactive function `tempo-template-NAME' that inserts the template<br/>at the point.  The created function is returned.<br/><br/>NAME is a string that contains the name of the template, ELEMENTS is a<br/>list of elements in the template, TAG is the tag used for completion,<br/>DOCUMENTATION is the documentation string for the insertion command<br/>created, and TAGLIST (a symbol) is the tag list that TAG (if provided)<br/>should be added to.  If TAGLIST is nil and TAG is non-nil, TAG is<br/>added to `tempo-tags'.<br/><br/>The elements in ELEMENTS can be of several types:<br/><br/> - A string: It is sent to the hooks in `tempo-insert-string-functions',<br/>   and the result is inserted.<br/> - The symbol `p': This position is saved in `tempo-marks'.<br/> - The symbol `r': If `tempo-insert' is called with ON-REGION non-nil<br/>   the current region is placed here.  Otherwise it works like `p'.<br/> - (p PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>): If `tempo-interactive' is non-nil, the<br/>   user is prompted in the minibuffer with PROMPT for a string to be<br/>   inserted.  If the optional parameter NAME is non-nil, the text is<br/>   saved for later insertion with the `s' tag.  If there already is<br/>   something saved under NAME that value is used instead and no<br/>   prompting is made.  If NOINSERT is provided and non-nil, nothing is<br/>   inserted, but text is still saved when a NAME is provided.  For<br/>   clarity, the symbol `noinsert' should be used as argument.<br/> - (P PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>): Works just like the previous tag, but<br/>   forces `tempo-interactive' to be true.<br/> - (r PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>): Like the previous tag, but if<br/>   `tempo-interactive' is nil and `tempo-insert' is called with<br/>   ON-REGION non-nil, the current region is placed here.  This usually<br/>   happens when you call the template function with a prefix argument.<br/> - (s NAME): Inserts text previously read with the (p ..) construct.<br/>   Finds the insertion saved under NAME and inserts it.  Acts like `p'<br/>   if tempo-interactive is nil.<br/> - `&': If there is only whitespace between the line start and point,<br/>   nothing happens.  Otherwise a newline is inserted.<br/> - `%': If there is only whitespace between point and end of line,<br/>   nothing happens.  Otherwise a newline is inserted.<br/> - `n': Inserts a newline.<br/> - `>': The line is indented using `indent-according-to-mode'.  Note<br/>   that you often should place this item after the text you want on<br/>   the line.<br/> - `r>': Like `r', but it also indents the region.<br/> - (r> PROMPT <NAME> <NOINSERT>): Like (r ...), but is also indents<br/>   the region.<br/> - `n>': Inserts a newline and indents line.<br/> - `o': Like `%' but leaves the point before the newline.<br/> - nil: It is ignored.<br/> - Anything else: It is evaluated and the result is treated as an<br/>   element to be inserted.  One additional tag is useful for these<br/>   cases.  If an expression returns a list '(l foo bar), the elements<br/>   after `l' will be inserted according to the usual rules.  This makes<br/>   it possible to return several elements from one expression.
