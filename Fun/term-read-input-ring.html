<strong>term-read-input-ring</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>term.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(term-read-input-ring &optional <u>SILENT</u>)</br>
</br>
Set the buffer's `term-input-ring' from a history file.</br>
The name of the file is given by the variable `term-input-ring-file-name'.</br>
The history ring is of size `term-input-ring-size', regardless of file size.</br>
If `term-input-ring-file-name' is nil this function does nothing.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>SILENT</u> is non-nil, we say nothing about a</br>
failure to read the history file.</br>
</br>
This function is useful for major mode commands and mode hooks.</br>
</br>
The structure of the history file should be one input command per line,</br>
with the most recent command last.</br>
