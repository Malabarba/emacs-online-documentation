term-read-noecho is a compiled Lisp function in `term.el'.<br/><br/>(term-read-noecho PROMPT &optional STARS)<br/><br/>Read a single line of text from user without echoing, and return it.<br/>Prompt with argument PROMPT, a string.  Optional argument STARS causes<br/>input to be echoed with '*' characters on the prompt line.  Input ends with<br/>RET, LFD, or ESC.  DEL or C-h rubs out.  C-u kills line.  C-g aborts (if<br/>`inhibit-quit' is set because e.g. this function was called from a process<br/>filter and C-g is pressed, this function returns nil rather than a string).<br/><br/>Note that the keystrokes comprising the text can still be recovered<br/>(temporarily) with C-h l.  This may be a security bug for some<br/>applications.
