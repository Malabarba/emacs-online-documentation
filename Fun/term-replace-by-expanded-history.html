term-replace-by-expanded-history is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `term.el'.<br/><br/>(term-replace-by-expanded-history &optional SILENT)<br/><br/>Expand input command history references before point.<br/>Expansion is dependent on the value of `term-input-autoexpand'.<br/><br/>This function depends on the buffer's idea of the input history, which may not<br/>match the command interpreter's idea, assuming it has one.<br/><br/>Assumes history syntax is like typical Un*x shells'.  However, since Emacs<br/>cannot know the interpreter's idea of input line numbers, assuming it has one,<br/>it cannot expand absolute input line number references.<br/><br/>If the optional argument SILENT is non-nil, never complain<br/>even if history reference seems erroneous.<br/><br/>See `term-magic-space' and `term-replace-by-expanded-history-before-point'.<br/><br/>Returns t if successful.
