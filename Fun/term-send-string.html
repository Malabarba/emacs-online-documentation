<strong>term-send-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>term.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(term-send-string <u>PROC</u> <u>STR</u>)</br>
</br>
Send to <u>PROC</u> the contents of <u>STR</u> as input.</br>
This is equivalent to `process-send-string', except that long input strings</br>
are broken up into chunks of size `term-input-chunk-size'.  Processes</br>
are given a chance to output between chunks.  This can help prevent processes</br>
from hanging when you send them long inputs on some OS's.
