term-send-string is a compiled Lisp function in `term.el'.<br/><br/>(term-send-string PROC STR)<br/><br/>Send to PROC the contents of STR as input.<br/>This is equivalent to `process-send-string', except that long input strings<br/>are broken up into chunks of size `term-input-chunk-size'.  Processes<br/>are given a chance to output between chunks.  This can help prevent processes<br/>from hanging when you send them long inputs on some OS's.
