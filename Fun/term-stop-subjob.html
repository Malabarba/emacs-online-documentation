term-stop-subjob is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `term.el'.<br/><br/>(term-stop-subjob)<br/><br/>Stop the current subjob.<br/>WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending<br/>the top-level process running in the buffer.  If you accidentally do<br/>this, use M-x term-continue-subjob to resume the process.  (This<br/>is not a problem with most shells, since they ignore this signal.)
