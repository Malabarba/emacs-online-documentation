<strong>terminal-emulator</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>terminal.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(terminal-emulator BUFFER PROGRAM ARGS &optional WIDTH HEIGHT)<br/>
<br/>
Under a display-terminal emulator in BUFFER, run PROGRAM on arguments ARGS.<br/>
ARGS is a list of argument-strings.  Remaining arguments are WIDTH and HEIGHT.<br/>
BUFFER's contents are made an image of the display generated by that program,<br/>
and any input typed when BUFFER is the current Emacs buffer is sent to that<br/>
program as keyboard input.<br/>
<br/>
Interactively, BUFFER defaults to "*terminal*" and PROGRAM and ARGS<br/>
are parsed from an input-string using your usual shell.<br/>
WIDTH and HEIGHT are determined from the size of the current window<br/>
-- WIDTH will be one less than the window's width, HEIGHT will be its height.<br/>
<br/>
To switch buffers and leave the emulator, or to give commands<br/>
to the emulator itself (as opposed to the program running under it),<br/>
type Control-^.  The following character is an emulator command.<br/>
Type Control-^ twice to send it to the subprogram.<br/>
This escape character may be changed using the variable `terminal-escape-char'.<br/>
<br/>
`Meta' characters may not currently be sent through the terminal emulator.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of some of the variables which control the behavior<br/>
of the emulator -- see their documentation for more information:<br/>
terminal-escape-char, terminal-scrolling, terminal-more-processing,<br/>
terminal-redisplay-interval.<br/>
<br/>
This function calls the value of terminal-mode-hook if that exists<br/>
and is non-nil after the terminal buffer has been set up and the<br/>
subprocess started.
