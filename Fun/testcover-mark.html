<strong>testcover-mark</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>testcover.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(testcover-mark <u>DEF</u>)</br>
</br>
Marks one <u>DEF</u> (a function or macro symbol) to highlight its contained forms</br>
that did not get completely tested during coverage tests.</br>
  A marking with the face `testcover-nohits' (default = red) indicates that the</br>
form was never evaluated.  A marking using the `testcover-1value' face</br>
(default = tan) indicates that the form always evaluated to the same value.</br>
  The forms throw, error, and signal are not marked.  They do not return and</br>
would always get a red mark.  Some forms that always return the same</br>
value (e.g., setq of a constant), always get a tan mark that can't be</br>
eliminated by adding more test cases.
