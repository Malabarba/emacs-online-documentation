<strong>testcover-mark</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>testcover.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(testcover-mark DEF)<br/>
<br/>
Marks one DEF (a function or macro symbol) to highlight its contained forms<br/>
that did not get completely tested during coverage tests.<br/>
  A marking with the face `testcover-nohits' (default = red) indicates that the<br/>
form was never evaluated.  A marking using the `testcover-1value' face<br/>
(default = tan) indicates that the form always evaluated to the same value.<br/>
  The forms throw, error, and signal are not marked.  They do not return and<br/>
would always get a red mark.  Some forms that always return the same<br/>
value (e.g., setq of a constant), always get a tan mark that can't be<br/>
eliminated by adding more test cases.
