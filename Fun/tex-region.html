<strong>tex-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>tex-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(tex-region <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Run TeX on the current region, via a temporary file.</br>
The file's name comes from the variable `tex-zap-file' and the</br>
variable `tex-directory' says where to put it.</br>
</br>
If the buffer has a header, the header is given to TeX before the</br>
region itself.  The buffer's header is all lines between the strings</br>
defined by `tex-start-of-header' and `tex-end-of-header' inclusive.</br>
The header must start in the first 100 lines of the buffer.</br>
</br>
The value of `tex-trailer' is given to TeX as input after the region.</br>
</br>
The value of `tex-command' specifies the command to use to run TeX.
