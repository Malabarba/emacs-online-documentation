texinfo-incorporate-menu-entry-names is a compiled Lisp function in `texnfo-upd.el'.<br/><br/>(texinfo-incorporate-menu-entry-names NEW-MENU-LIST)<br/><br/>Copy any old menu entry names to the new menu.<br/><br/>Point must be at beginning of old menu.<br/><br/>If the node-name of the new menu entry cannot be found in the old<br/>menu, do nothing.<br/><br/>For this function, the new menu is a list made up of lists of dotted<br/>pairs in which the first element of the pair is the node name and the<br/>second element is the description (or nil).<br/><br/>If we find an existing menu entry name, we change the first element of<br/>the pair to be another dotted pair in which the car is the menu entry<br/>name and the cdr is the node name.<br/><br/>NEW-MENU-LIST is changed destructively.  The old menu is the menu as it<br/>appears in the texinfo file.
