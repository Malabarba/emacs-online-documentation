<strong>texinfo-make-menu</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>texnfo-upd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(texinfo-make-menu &optional BEGINNING END)<br/>
<br/>
Without any prefix argument, make or update a menu.<br/>
Make the menu for the section enclosing the node found following point.<br/>
<br/>
A prefix argument means make or update menus<br/>
for nodes within or part of the marked region.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a menu exists, and is being updated, the descriptions that<br/>
are associated with node names in the pre-existing menu are<br/>
incorporated into the new menu.<br/>
<br/>
Leaves trailing whitespace in a menu that lacks descriptions, so<br/>
descriptions will format well.  In general, a menu should contain<br/>
descriptions, because node names and section titles are often too<br/>
short to explain a node well.
