<strong>texinfo-master-menu</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>texnfo-upd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(texinfo-master-menu UPDATE-ALL-NODES-MENUS-P)<br/>
<br/>
Make a master menu for a whole Texinfo file.<br/>
Remove pre-existing master menu, if there is one.<br/>
<br/>
This function supports only single-file manuals.  For multi-file<br/>
manuals, use `texinfo-multiple-files-update'.<br/>
<br/>
This function creates or updates the @detailmenu section of a<br/>
master menu that follows the Top node.  It replaces any existing<br/>
detailed menu that follows the top node.  The detailed menu<br/>
includes every entry from all the other menus.  By default, the<br/>
existing menus, including the menu in the Top node, are not<br/>
updated according to the buffer contents, so all the menus should<br/>
be updated first using `texinfo-make-menu' or<br/>
`texinfo-all-menus-update', which see.  Alternatively, invoke<br/>
this function with a prefix argument, see below.<br/>
<br/>
Non-nil, non-numeric argument (C-u prefix, if interactive) means<br/>
first update all existing menus in the buffer (incorporating<br/>
descriptions from pre-existing menus) before it constructs the<br/>
master menu.  If the argument is numeric (e.g., "C-u 2"),<br/>
update all existing nodes as well, by calling<br/>
`texinfo-update-node' on the entire file.  Warning: do NOT<br/>
invoke with a numeric argument if your Texinfo file uses @node<br/>
lines without the `Next', `Previous', `Up' pointers, as the<br/>
result could be an invalid Texinfo file!<br/>
<br/>
The function removes and recreates the detailed part of an already<br/>
existing master menu.  This action assumes that the pre-existing<br/>
master menu uses the standard `texinfo-master-menu-header' for the<br/>
detailed menu.<br/>
<br/>
The master menu has the following format, which is adapted from the<br/>
recommendation in the Texinfo Manual:<br/>
<br/>
   * The first part contains the major nodes in the Texinfo file: the<br/>
     nodes for the chapters, chapter-like sections, and the major<br/>
     appendices.  This includes the indices, so long as they are in<br/>
     chapter-like sections, such as unnumbered sections.<br/>
<br/>
   * The second and subsequent parts contain a listing of the other,<br/>
     lower level menus, in order.  This way, an inquirer can go<br/>
     directly to a particular node if he or she is searching for<br/>
     specific information.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the menus in the detailed node listing is introduced by the<br/>
title of the section containing the menu.<br/>
<br/>
Indents the first line of descriptions, and leaves trailing whitespace<br/>
in a menu that lacks descriptions, so descriptions will format well.<br/>
In general, a menu should contain descriptions, because node names and<br/>
section titles are often too short to explain a node well.
