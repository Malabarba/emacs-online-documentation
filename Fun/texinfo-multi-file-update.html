texinfo-multi-file-update is a compiled Lisp function in `texnfo-upd.el'.<br/><br/>(texinfo-multi-file-update FILES &optional UPDATE-EVERYTHING)<br/><br/>Update first node pointers in each file in FILES.<br/>Return a list of the node names.<br/><br/>The first file in the list is an outer file; the remaining are<br/>files included in the outer file with `@include' commands.<br/><br/>If optional arg UPDATE-EVERYTHING non-nil, update every menu and<br/>pointer in each of the included files.<br/><br/>Also update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer file.<br/><br/>Requirements:<br/><br/>  * the first file in the FILES list must be the outer file,<br/>  * each of the included files must contain exactly one highest<br/>    hierarchical level node,<br/>  * this node must be the first node in the included file,<br/>  * each highest hierarchical level node must be of the same type.<br/><br/>Thus, normally, each included file contains one, and only one, chapter.<br/><br/>However, when an included file does not have any node lines in<br/>it, this command does not try to create a menu entry for it.<br/>Consequently, you can include any file, such as a version or an<br/>update file without node lines, not just files that are<br/>chapters.
