<strong>texinfo-multiple-files-update</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>texnfo-upd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(texinfo-multiple-files-update OUTER-FILE &optional MAKE-MASTER-MENU UPDATE-EVERYTHING)<br/>
<br/>
Update first node pointers in each file included in OUTER-FILE;<br/>
create or update the `Top' level node pointers and the main menu in<br/>
the outer file that refers to such nodes.  This does not create or<br/>
update menus or pointers within the included files.<br/>
<br/>
With optional MAKE-MASTER-MENU argument (prefix arg, if interactive),<br/>
insert a master menu in OUTER-FILE in addition to creating or updating<br/>
pointers in the first @node line in each included file and creating or<br/>
updating the `Top' level node pointers of the outer file.  This does<br/>
not create or update other menus and pointers within the included<br/>
files.<br/>
<br/>
With optional UPDATE-EVERYTHING argument (numeric prefix arg, if<br/>
interactive), update all the menus and all the `Next', `Previous', and<br/>
`Up' pointers of all the files included in OUTER-FILE before inserting<br/>
a master menu in OUTER-FILE.  Also, update the `Top' level node<br/>
pointers of OUTER-FILE.  Do NOT invoke this command with a numeric prefix<br/>
arg, if your files use @node lines without the `Next', `Previous', `Up'<br/>
pointers, because this could produce invalid Texinfo files due to known<br/>
deficiencies in `texinfo-update-node': it does not support the @ignore<br/>
and @if... directives.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
<br/>
  * this command does NOT save any files--you must save the<br/>
    outer file and any modified, included files.<br/>
<br/>
  * except for the `Top' node, this command does NOT handle any<br/>
    pre-existing nodes in the outer file; hence, indices must be<br/>
    enclosed in an included file.<br/>
<br/>
Requirements:<br/>
<br/>
  * each of the included files must contain exactly one highest<br/>
    hierarchical level node,<br/>
  * this highest node must be the first node in the included file,<br/>
  * each highest hierarchical level node must be of the same type.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, normally, each included file contains one, and only one,<br/>
chapter.
