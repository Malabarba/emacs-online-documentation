<strong>texinfo-raise-lower-sections</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>texinfmt.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(texinfo-raise-lower-sections)</br>
</br>
Raise or lower the hierarchical level of chapters, sections, etc.</br>
</br>
This function acts according to `@raisesections' and `@lowersections'</br>
commands in the Texinfo file.</br>
</br>
For example, an `@lowersections' command is useful if you wish to</br>
include what is written as an outer or standalone Texinfo file in</br>
another Texinfo file as an inner, included file.  The `@lowersections'</br>
command changes chapters to sections, sections to subsections and so</br>
on.</br>
</br>
@raisesections changes @subsection to @section,</br>
                       @section    to @chapter,</br>
                       @heading    to @chapheading,</br>
                       etc.</br>
</br>
@lowersections changes @chapter    to @section,</br>
                       @subsection to @subsubsection,</br>
                       @heading    to @subheading,</br>
                       etc.</br>
</br>
An `@raisesections' or `@lowersections' command changes only those</br>
structuring commands that follow the `@raisesections' or</br>
`@lowersections' command.</br>
</br>
An `@lowersections' command cancels an `@raisesections' command, and</br>
vice versa.</br>
</br>
Repeated use of the commands continue to raise or lower the hierarchical</br>
level a step at a time.</br>
</br>
An attempt to raise above `chapters' reproduces chapter commands; an</br>
attempt to lower below subsubsections reproduces subsubsection</br>
commands.
