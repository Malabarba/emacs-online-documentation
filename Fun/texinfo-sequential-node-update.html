<strong>texinfo-sequential-node-update</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>texnfo-upd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(texinfo-sequential-node-update &optional <u>REGION-P</u>)</br>
</br>
Update one node (or many) in a Texinfo file with sequential pointers.</br>
</br>
This function causes the `Next' or `Previous' pointer to point to the</br>
immediately preceding or following node, even if it is at a higher or</br>
lower hierarchical level in the document.  Continually pressing `n' or</br>
`p' takes you straight through the file.</br>
</br>
Without any prefix argument, update the node in which point is located.</br>
Non-nil argument (prefix, if interactive) means update the nodes in the</br>
marked region.</br>
</br>
This command makes it awkward to navigate among sections and</br>
subsections; it should be used only for those documents that are meant</br>
to be read like a novel rather than a reference, and for which the</br>
Info `g*' command is inadequate.
