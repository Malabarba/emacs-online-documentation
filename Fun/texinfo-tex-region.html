<strong>texinfo-tex-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>texinfo.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(texinfo-tex-region <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Run TeX on the current region.</br>
This works by writing a temporary file (`tex-zap-file') in the directory</br>
that is the value of `tex-directory', then running TeX on that file.</br>
</br>
The first line of the buffer is copied to the</br>
temporary file; and if the buffer has a header, it is written to the</br>
temporary file before the region itself.  The buffer's header is all lines</br>
between the strings defined by `tex-start-of-header' and `tex-end-of-header'</br>
inclusive.  The header must start in the first 100 lines.</br>
</br>
The value of `texinfo-tex-trailer' is appended to the temporary file after the region.
