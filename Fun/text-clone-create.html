<strong>text-clone-create</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(text-clone-create START END &optional SPREADP SYNTAX)<br/>
<br/>
Create a text clone of START...END at point.<br/>
Text clones are chunks of text that are automatically kept identical:<br/>
changes done to one of the clones will be immediately propagated to the other.<br/>
<br/>
The buffer's content at point is assumed to be already identical to<br/>
the one between START and END.<br/>
If SYNTAX is provided it's a regexp that describes the possible text of<br/>
the clones; the clone will be shrunk or killed if necessary to ensure that<br/>
its text matches the regexp.<br/>
If SPREADP is non-nil it indicates that text inserted before/after the<br/>
clone should be incorporated in the clone.
