<strong>text-clone-create</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(text-clone-create <u>START</u> <u>END</u> &optional <u>SPREADP</u> <u>SYNTAX</u>)</br>
</br>
Create a text clone of <u>START</u>...<u>END</u> at point.</br>
Text clones are chunks of text that are automatically kept identical:</br>
changes done to one of the clones will be immediately propagated to the other.</br>
</br>
The buffer's content at point is assumed to be already identical to</br>
the one between <u>START</u> and <u>END</u>.</br>
If <u>SYNTAX</u> is provided it's a regexp that describes the possible text of</br>
the clones; the clone will be shrunk or killed if necessary to ensure that</br>
its text matches the regexp.</br>
If <u>SPREADP</u> is non-nil it indicates that text inserted before/after the</br>
clone should be incorporated in the clone.
