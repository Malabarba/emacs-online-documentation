<strong>text-scale-adjust</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>face-remap.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x C-0, C-x C-=, C-x C--, C-x C-+.</br>
</br>
<code>(text-scale-adjust <u>INC</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Adjust the height of the default face by <u>INC</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>INC</u> may be passed as a numeric prefix argument.</br>
</br>
The actual adjustment made depends on the final component of the</br>
key-binding used to invoke the command, with all modifiers removed:</br>
</br>
   +, =   Increase the default face height by one step</br>
   -      Decrease the default face height by one step</br>
   0      Reset the default face height to the global default</br>
</br>
After adjusting, continue to read input events and further adjust</br>
the face height as long as the input event read</br>
(with all modifiers removed) is one of the above characters.</br>
</br>
Each step scales the height of the default face by the variable</br>
`text-scale-mode-step' (a negative number of steps decreases the</br>
height by the same amount).  As a special case, an argument of 0</br>
will remove any scaling currently active.</br>
</br>
This command is a special-purpose wrapper around the</br>
`text-scale-increase' command which makes repetition convenient</br>
even when it is bound in a non-top-level keymap.  For binding in</br>
a top-level keymap, `text-scale-increase' or</br>
`text-scale-decrease' may be more appropriate.
