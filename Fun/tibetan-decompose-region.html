<strong>tibetan-decompose-region</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>tibet-util.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(tibetan-decompose-region FROM TO)<br/>
<br/>
Decompose Tibetan text in the region FROM and TO.<br/>
This is different from decompose-region because precomposed Tibetan characters<br/>
are decomposed into normal Tibetan character sequences.
