<strong>time-stamp</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>time-stamp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(time-stamp)<br/>
<br/>
Update the time stamp string(s) in the buffer.<br/>
A template in a file can be automatically updated with a new time stamp<br/>
every time you save the file.  Add this line to your init file:<br/>
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp)<br/>
or customize `before-save-hook' through Custom.<br/>
Normally the template must appear in the first 8 lines of a file and<br/>
look like one of the following:<br/>
      Time-stamp: <><br/>
      Time-stamp: " "<br/>
The time stamp is written between the brackets or quotes:<br/>
      Time-stamp: <2001-02-18 10:20:51 gildea><br/>
The time stamp is updated only if the variable `time-stamp-active' is non-nil.<br/>
The format of the time stamp is set by the variable `time-stamp-pattern' or<br/>
`time-stamp-format'.  The variables `time-stamp-pattern',<br/>
`time-stamp-line-limit', `time-stamp-start', `time-stamp-end',<br/>
`time-stamp-count', and `time-stamp-inserts-lines' control finding<br/>
the template.
