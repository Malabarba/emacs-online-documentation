<strong>time-to-seconds</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="float-time.html">float-time</a></strong>' in `<code>time-date.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(time-to-seconds &optional <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the current time, as a float number of seconds since the epoch.</br>
If <u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u> is given, it is the time to convert to float</br>
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the form</br>
(HIGH LOW) or (HIGH LOW USEC) or (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC).  Thus,</br>
you can use times from `current-time' and from `file-attributes'.</br>
<u>SPECIFIED-TIME</u> can also have the form (HIGH . LOW), but this is</br>
considered obsolete.</br>
</br>
WARNING: Since the result is floating point, it may not be exact.</br>
If precise time stamps are required, use either `current-time',</br>
or (if you need time as a string) `format-time-string'.
