timeclock-in is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `timeclock.el'.<br/><br/>(timeclock-in &optional ARG PROJECT FIND-PROJECT)<br/><br/>Clock in, recording the current time moment in the timelog.<br/>With a numeric prefix ARG, record the fact that today has only that<br/>many hours in it to be worked.  If ARG is a non-numeric prefix argument<br/>(non-nil, but not a number), 0 is assumed (working on a holiday or<br/>weekend).  *If not called interactively, ARG should be the number of<br/>_seconds_ worked today*.  This feature only has effect the first time<br/>this function is called within a day.<br/><br/>PROJECT is the project being clocked into.  If PROJECT is nil, and<br/>FIND-PROJECT is non-nil -- or the user calls `timeclock-in'<br/>interactively -- call the function `timeclock-get-project-function' to<br/>discover the name of the project.
