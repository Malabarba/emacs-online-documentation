<strong>timeclock-seconds-to-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>timeclock.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(timeclock-seconds-to-string SECONDS &optional SHOW-SECONDS REVERSE-LEADER)<br/>
<br/>
Convert SECONDS into a compact time string.<br/>
If SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil, make the resolution of the return string<br/>
include the second count.  If REVERSE-LEADER is non-nil, it means to<br/>
output a "+" if the time value is negative, rather than a "-".<br/>
This is used when negative time values have an inverted meaning (such<br/>
as with time remaining, where negative time really means overtime).
