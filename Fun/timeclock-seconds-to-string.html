<strong>timeclock-seconds-to-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>timeclock.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(timeclock-seconds-to-string <u>SECONDS</u> &optional <u>SHOW-SECONDS</u> <u>REVERSE-LEADER</u>)</br>
</br>
Convert <u>SECONDS</u> into a compact time string.</br>
If <u>SHOW-SECONDS</u> is non-nil, make the resolution of the return string</br>
include the second count.  If <u>REVERSE-LEADER</u> is non-nil, it means to</br>
output a "+" if the time value is negative, rather than a "-".</br>
This is used when negative time values have an inverted meaning (such</br>
as with time remaining, where negative time really means overtime).
