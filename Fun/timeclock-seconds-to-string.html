timeclock-seconds-to-string is a compiled Lisp function in `timeclock.el'.<br/><br/>(timeclock-seconds-to-string SECONDS &optional SHOW-SECONDS REVERSE-LEADER)<br/><br/>Convert SECONDS into a compact time string.<br/>If SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil, make the resolution of the return string<br/>include the second count.  If REVERSE-LEADER is non-nil, it means to<br/>output a "+" if the time value is negative, rather than a "-".<br/>This is used when negative time values have an inverted meaning (such<br/>as with time remaining, where negative time really means overtime).
