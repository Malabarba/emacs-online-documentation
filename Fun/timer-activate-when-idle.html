<strong>timer-activate-when-idle</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>timer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(timer-activate-when-idle TIMER &optional DONT-WAIT REUSE-CELL)<br/>
<br/>
Insert TIMER into `timer-idle-list'.<br/>
This arranges to activate TIMER whenever Emacs is next idle.<br/>
If optional argument DONT-WAIT is non-nil, set TIMER to activate<br/>
immediately (see below), or at the right time, if Emacs is<br/>
already idle.<br/>
<br/>
REUSE-CELL, if non-nil, is a cons cell to reuse when inserting<br/>
TIMER into `timer-idle-list' (usually a cell removed from that<br/>
list by `cancel-timer-internal'; using this reduces consing for<br/>
repeat timers).  If nil, allocate a new cell.<br/>
<br/>
Using non-nil DONT-WAIT is not recommended when activating an<br/>
idle timer from an idle timer handler, if the timer being<br/>
activated has an idleness time that is smaller or equal to<br/>
the time of the current timer.  That's because the activated<br/>
timer will fire right away.
