<strong>timer-set-time-with-usecs</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>timer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(timer-set-time-with-usecs TIMER TIME USECS &optional DELTA)<br/>
<br/>
This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>
use `timer-set-time' and `timer-inc-time' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Set the trigger time of TIMER to TIME plus USECS.<br/>
TIME must be in the internal format returned by, e.g., `current-time'.<br/>
The microsecond count from TIME is ignored, and USECS is used instead.<br/>
If optional fourth argument DELTA is a positive number, make the timer<br/>
fire repeatedly that many seconds apart.
