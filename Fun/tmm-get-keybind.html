<strong>tmm-get-keybind</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>tmm.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(tmm-get-keybind <u>KEYSEQ</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the current binding of <u>KEYSEQ</u>, merging prefix definitions.</br>
If <u>KEYSEQ</u> is a prefix key that has local and global bindings,</br>
we merge them into a single keymap which shows the proper order of the menu.</br>
However, for the menu bar itself, the value does not take account</br>
of `menu-bar-final-items'.
