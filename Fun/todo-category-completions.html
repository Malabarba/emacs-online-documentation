<strong>todo-category-completions</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>todo-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(todo-category-completions &optional <u>ARCHIVE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a list of completions for `todo-read-category'.</br>
Each element of the list is a cons of a category name and the</br>
file or list of files (as short file names) it is in.  The files</br>
are either the current (or if there is none, the default) todo</br>
file plus the files listed in `todo-category-completions-files',</br>
or, with non-nil <u>ARCHIVE</u>, the current archive file.</br>
</br>
Before calculating the completions, update the value of</br>
`todo-category-completions-files' in case any files named in it</br>
have been removed.
