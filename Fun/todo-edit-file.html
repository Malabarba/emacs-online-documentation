<strong>todo-edit-file</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>todo-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(todo-edit-file)</br>
</br>
Put current buffer in `todo-edit-mode'.</br>
This makes the entire file visible and the buffer writable and</br>
you can use the self-insertion keys and standard Emacs editing</br>
commands to make changes.  To return to Todo mode, type</br>
M-x todo-edit-quit.  This runs a file format check, signaling</br>
an error if the format has become invalid.  However, this check</br>
cannot tell if the number of items changed, which could result in</br>
the file containing inconsistent information.  For this reason</br>
this command should be used with caution.
