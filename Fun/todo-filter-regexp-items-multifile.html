</br>
(todo-filter-regexp-items-multifile &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Prompt for a regular expression and display items that match it.</br>
The matches can be from any categories in the files listed in</br>
`todo-filter-files', or if this nil, in the files chosen from a</br>
file selection dialog that pops up in this case.  With non-nil</br>
option `todo-filter-done-items', the matches can include not</br>
only todo items but also done items, including those in Archive</br>
files.</br>
</br>
Called with no prefix <u>ARG</u>, if a regexp items file for the current</br>
todo file has previously been saved (see</br>
`todo-save-filtered-items-buffer'), visit this file; if there is</br>
no such file, build the list of regexp items.  Called with a</br>
prefix argument, build the list even if there is a saved file of</br>
regexp items.
