<strong>todo-filter-regexp-items</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>todo-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(todo-filter-regexp-items &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Prompt for a regular expression and display items that match it.</br>
The matches can be from any categories in the current todo file</br>
and with non-nil option `todo-filter-done-items', can include</br>
not only todo items but also done items, including those in</br>
Archive files.</br>
</br>
Called with no prefix <u>ARG</u>, if a regexp items file for the current</br>
todo file has previously been saved (see</br>
`todo-save-filtered-items-buffer'), visit this file; if there is</br>
no such file, build the list of regexp items.  Called with a</br>
prefix argument, build the list even if there is a saved file of</br>
regexp items.
