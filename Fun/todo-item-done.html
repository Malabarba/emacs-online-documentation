<strong>todo-item-done</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>todo-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(todo-item-done &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Tag a todo item in this category as done and relocate it.</br>
</br>
With prefix argument <u>ARG</u> prompt for a comment and append it to</br>
the done item; this is only possible if there are no marked</br>
items.  If there are marked items, tag all of these with</br>
`todo-done-string' plus the current date and, if</br>
`todo-always-add-time-string' is non-nil, the current time;</br>
otherwise, just tag the item at point.  Items tagged as done are</br>
relocated to the category's (by default hidden) done section.  If</br>
done items are visible on invoking this command, they remain</br>
visible.
