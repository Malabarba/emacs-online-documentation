</br>
(todo-merge-category &optional <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Merge current category into another existing category.</br>
</br>
With prefix argument <u>FILE</u>, prompt for a specific todo file and</br>
choose (with TAB completion) a category in it to merge into;</br>
otherwise, choose and merge into a category in either the</br>
current todo file or a file in `todo-category-completions-files'.</br>
</br>
After merging, the current category's todo and done items are</br>
appended to the chosen goal category's todo and done items,</br>
respectively.  The goal category becomes the current category,</br>
and the previous current category is deleted.</br>
</br>
If both the first and goal categories also have archived items,</br>
the former are merged to the latter.  If only the first category</br>
has archived items, the archived category is renamed to the goal</br>
category.
