<strong>tq-enqueue</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>tq.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(tq-enqueue <u>TQ</u> <u>QUESTION</u> <u>REGEXP</u> <u>CLOSURE</u> <u>FN</u> &optional <u>DELAY-QUESTION</u>)</br>
</br>
Add a transaction to transaction queue <u>TQ</u>.</br>
This sends the string <u>QUESTION</u> to the process that <u>TQ</u> communicates with.</br>
</br>
When the corresponding answer comes back, we call <u>FN</u> with two</br>
arguments: <u>CLOSURE</u>, which may contain additional data that <u>FN</u></br>
needs, and the answer to the question.</br>
</br>
<u>REGEXP</u> is a regular expression to match the entire answer;</br>
that's how we tell where the answer ends.</br>
</br>
If <u>DELAY-QUESTION</u> is non-nil, delay sending this question until</br>
the process has finished replying to any previous questions.</br>
This produces more reliable results with some processes.
