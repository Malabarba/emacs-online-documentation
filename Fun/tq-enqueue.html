<strong>tq-enqueue</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>tq.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(tq-enqueue TQ QUESTION REGEXP CLOSURE FN &optional DELAY-QUESTION)<br/>
<br/>
Add a transaction to transaction queue TQ.<br/>
This sends the string QUESTION to the process that TQ communicates with.<br/>
<br/>
When the corresponding answer comes back, we call FN with two<br/>
arguments: CLOSURE, which may contain additional data that FN<br/>
needs, and the answer to the question.<br/>
<br/>
REGEXP is a regular expression to match the entire answer;<br/>
that's how we tell where the answer ends.<br/>
<br/>
If DELAY-QUESTION is non-nil, delay sending this question until<br/>
the process has finished replying to any previous questions.<br/>
This produces more reliable results with some processes.
