<strong>tramp-gw-open-connection</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>tramp-gw.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(tramp-gw-open-connection VEC GW-VEC TARGET-VEC)<br/>
<br/>
Open a remote connection to VEC (see `tramp-file-name' structure).<br/>
Take GW-VEC as SOCKS or HTTP gateway, i.e. its method must be a<br/>
gateway method.  TARGET-VEC identifies where to connect to via<br/>
the gateway, it can be different from VEC when there are more<br/>
hops to be applied.<br/>
<br/>
It returns a string like "localhost#port", which must be used<br/>
instead of the host name declared in TARGET-VEC.
