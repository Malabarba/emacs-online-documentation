<strong>transient-mark-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <options> <transient-mark-mode>.<br/>
<br/>
(transient-mark-mode &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Toggle Transient Mark mode.<br/>
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Transient Mark mode if ARG is<br/>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable<br/>
Transient Mark mode if ARG is omitted or nil.<br/>
<br/>
Transient Mark mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, the<br/>
region is highlighted whenever the mark is active.  The mark is<br/>
"deactivated" by changing the buffer, and after certain other<br/>
operations that set the mark but whose main purpose is something<br/>
else--for example, incremental search, M-<, and M->.<br/>
<br/>
You can also deactivate the mark by typing C-g or<br/>
M-ESC ESC.<br/>
<br/>
Many commands change their behavior when Transient Mark mode is<br/>
in effect and the mark is active, by acting on the region instead<br/>
of their usual default part of the buffer's text.  Examples of<br/>
such commands include M-;, M-x flush-lines, M-x keep-lines,<br/>
M-%, C-M-%, M-x ispell, and C-x u.<br/>
To see the documentation of commands which are sensitive to the<br/>
Transient Mark mode, invoke C-h d and type "transient"<br/>
or "mark.*active" at the prompt.
