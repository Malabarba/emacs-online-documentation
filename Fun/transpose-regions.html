<strong>transpose-regions</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(transpose-regions <u>STARTR1</u> <u>ENDR1</u> <u>STARTR2</u> <u>ENDR2</u> &optional <u>LEAVE-MARKERS</u>)</br>
</br>
Transpose region <u>STARTR1</u> to <u>ENDR1</u> with <u>STARTR2</u> to <u>ENDR2</u>.</br>
The regions should not be overlapping, because the size of the buffer is</br>
never changed in a transposition.</br>
</br>
Optional fifth arg <u>LEAVE-MARKERS</u>, if non-nil, means don't update</br>
any markers that happen to be located in the regions.</br>
</br>
Transposing beyond buffer boundaries is an error.
