<br/>
(transpose-subr MOVER ARG &optional SPECIAL)<br/>
<br/>
Subroutine to do the work of transposing objects.<br/>
Works for lines, sentences, paragraphs, etc.  MOVER is a function that<br/>
moves forward by units of the given object (e.g. forward-sentence,<br/>
forward-paragraph).  If ARG is zero, exchanges the current object<br/>
with the one containing mark.  If ARG is an integer, moves the<br/>
current object past ARG following (if ARG is positive) or<br/>
preceding (if ARG is negative) objects, leaving point after the<br/>
current object.
