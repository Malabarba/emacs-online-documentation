<strong>tree-widget-set-theme</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>tree-widget.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(tree-widget-set-theme &optional <u>NAME</u>)</br>
</br>
In the current buffer, set the theme to use for images.</br>
The current buffer must be where the tree widget is drawn.</br>
Optional argument <u>NAME</u> is the name of the theme to use.  It defaults</br>
to the value of the variable `tree-widget-theme'.</br>
Does nothing if <u>NAME</u> is already the current theme.</br>
</br>
If there is a "tree-widget-theme-setup" library in the theme</br>
directory, load it to setup a parent theme or the images properties.</br>
Typically it should contain something like this:</br>
</br>
  (tree-widget-set-parent-theme "my-parent-theme")</br>
  (tree-widget-set-image-properties</br>
   (if (featurep 'xemacs)</br>
       '(:ascent center)</br>
     '(:ascent center :mask (heuristic t))</br>
     ))
