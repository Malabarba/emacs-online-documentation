<strong>tty-find-type</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>faces.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(tty-find-type PRED TYPE)<br/>
<br/>
Return the longest prefix of TYPE to which PRED returns non-nil.<br/>
TYPE should be a tty type name such as "xterm-16color".<br/>

The function tries only those prefixes that are followed by a<br/>
dash or underscore in the original type name, like "xterm" in<br/>
the above example.
