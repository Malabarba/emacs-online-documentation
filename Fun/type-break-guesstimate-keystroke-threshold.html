type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `type-break.el'.<br/><br/>(type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold WPM &optional WORDLEN FRAC)<br/><br/>Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.<br/><br/>If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how<br/>many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your<br/>maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it<br/>can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one<br/>tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing<br/>documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate<br/>average typing speed.)<br/><br/>From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'<br/>based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average<br/>length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of<br/>the computed maximum threshold.<br/><br/>When called from Lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be<br/>used to override the default assumption about average word length and the<br/>fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.<br/>FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of<br/>2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.
