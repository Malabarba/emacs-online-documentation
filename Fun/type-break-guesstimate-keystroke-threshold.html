<strong>type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>type-break.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold <u>WPM</u> &optional <u>WORDLEN</u> <u>FRAC</u>)</br>
</br>
Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.</br>
</br>
If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how</br>
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your</br>
maximum <u>WPM</u>, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it</br>
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one</br>
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing</br>
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate</br>
average typing speed.)</br>
</br>
From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'</br>
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average</br>
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of</br>
the computed maximum threshold.</br>
</br>
When called from Lisp programs, the optional args <u>WORDLEN</u> and <u>FRAC</u> can be</br>
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the</br>
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.</br>
<u>FRAC</u> should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of</br>
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.
