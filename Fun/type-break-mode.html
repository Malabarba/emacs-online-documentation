type-break-mode is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `type-break.el'.<br/><br/>(type-break-mode &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Enable or disable typing-break mode.<br/>This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.<br/><br/>When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at<br/>appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the<br/>user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user<br/>is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, Emacs will ask<br/>again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time<br/>to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently<br/>annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.<br/><br/>A negative prefix argument disables this mode.<br/>No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.<br/><br/>The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the<br/>same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or<br/>reset the keystroke counter.<br/><br/>If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of<br/>calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to<br/>make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the<br/>break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.<br/><br/>The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to<br/>schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly<br/>affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the<br/>`type-break-schedule' command.<br/><br/>If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum<br/>amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever<br/>that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for<br/>later even if Emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break<br/>is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether<br/>or not to continue.  A nil value for this variable prevents automatic<br/>break rescheduling, making `type-break-interval' an upper bound on the time<br/>between breaks.  In this case breaks will be prompted for as usual before<br/>the upper bound if the keystroke threshold is reached.<br/><br/>If `type-break-good-rest-interval' is nil and<br/>`type-break-good-break-interval' is set, then confirmation is required to<br/>interrupt a break before `type-break-good-break-interval' seconds<br/>have passed.  This provides for an upper bound on the time between breaks<br/>together with confirmation of interruptions to these breaks.<br/><br/>The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the<br/>thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use<br/>the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to<br/>approximate good values for this.<br/><br/>There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about<br/>imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:<br/><br/>        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'<br/>        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'<br/>        `type-break-keystroke-warning-intervals'<br/>        `type-break-warning-repeat'<br/>        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'<br/>        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'<br/><br/>There are several variables that affect if, how, and when queries to begin<br/>a typing break occur.  They include:<br/><br/>        `type-break-query-mode'<br/>        `type-break-query-function'<br/>        `type-break-query-interval'<br/><br/>The command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things.<br/><br/>Finally, a file (named `type-break-file-name') is used to store information<br/>across Emacs sessions.  This provides recovery of the break status between<br/>sessions and after a crash.  Manual changes to the file may result in<br/>problems.
