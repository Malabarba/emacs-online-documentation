<strong>undo-make-selective-list</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(undo-make-selective-list <u>START</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a list of undo elements for the region <u>START</u> to <u>END</u>.</br>
The elements come from `buffer-undo-list', but we keep only the</br>
elements inside this region, and discard those outside this</br>
region.  The elements' positions are adjusted so as the returned</br>
list can be applied to the current buffer.
