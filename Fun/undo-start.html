<strong>undo-start</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(undo-start &optional BEG END)<br/>
<br/>
Set `pending-undo-list' to the front of the undo list.<br/>
The next call to `undo-more' will undo the most recently made change.<br/>
If BEG and END are specified, then only undo elements<br/>
that apply to text between BEG and END are used; other undo elements<br/>
are ignored.  If BEG and END are nil, all undo elements are used.
