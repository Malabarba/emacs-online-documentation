<strong>undo-start</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(undo-start &optional <u>BEG</u> <u>END</u>)</br>
</br>
Set `pending-undo-list' to the front of the undo list.</br>
The next call to `undo-more' will undo the most recently made change.</br>
If <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> are specified, then only undo elements</br>
that apply to text between <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> are used; other undo elements</br>
are ignored.  If <u>BEG</u> and <u>END</u> are nil, all undo elements are used.
