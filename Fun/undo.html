<strong>undo</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-_, &lt;undo>, C-/, C-x u, &lt;menu-bar> &lt;edit> &lt;undo>.</br>
</br>
<code>(undo <em>&optional</em> <u>ARG</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Undo some previous changes.</br>
Repeat this command to undo more changes.</br>
A numeric <u>ARG</u> serves as a repeat count.</br>
</br>
In Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, only undo changes within</br>
the current region.  Similarly, when not in Transient Mark mode, just C-u</br>
as an argument limits undo to changes within the current region.
