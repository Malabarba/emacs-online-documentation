unload-feature is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `loadhist.el'.<br/><br/>(unload-feature FEATURE &optional FORCE)<br/><br/>Unload the library that provided FEATURE.<br/>If the feature is required by any other loaded code, and prefix arg FORCE<br/>is nil, raise an error.<br/><br/>Standard unloading activities include restoring old autoloads for<br/>functions defined by the library, undoing any additions that the<br/>library has made to hook variables or to `auto-mode-alist', undoing<br/>ELP profiling of functions in that library, unproviding any features<br/>provided by the library, and canceling timers held in variables<br/>defined by the library.<br/><br/>If a function `FEATURE-unload-function' is defined, this function<br/>calls it with no arguments, before doing anything else.  That function<br/>can do whatever is appropriate to undo the loading of the library.  If<br/>`FEATURE-unload-function' returns non-nil, that suppresses the<br/>standard unloading of the library.  Otherwise the standard unloading<br/>proceeds.<br/><br/>`FEATURE-unload-function' has access to the package's list of<br/>definitions in the variable `unload-function-defs-list' and could<br/>remove symbols from it in the event that the package has done<br/>something strange, such as redefining an Emacs function.
