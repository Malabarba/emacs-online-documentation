</br>
</br>
(unload-feature <u>FEATURE</u> &optional <u>FORCE</u>)</br>
</br>
Unload the library that provided <u>FEATURE</u>.</br>
If the feature is required by any other loaded code, and prefix arg <u>FORCE</u></br>
is nil, raise an error.</br>
</br>
Standard unloading activities include restoring old autoloads for</br>
functions defined by the library, undoing any additions that the</br>
library has made to hook variables or to `auto-mode-alist', undoing</br>
ELP profiling of functions in that library, unproviding any features</br>
provided by the library, and canceling timers held in variables</br>
defined by the library.</br>
</br>
If a function `<u>FEATURE</u>-unload-function' is defined, this function</br>
calls it with no arguments, before doing anything else.  That function</br>
can do whatever is appropriate to undo the loading of the library.  If</br>
`<u>FEATURE</u>-unload-function' returns non-nil, that suppresses the</br>
standard unloading of the library.  Otherwise the standard unloading</br>
proceeds.</br>
</br>
`<u>FEATURE</u>-unload-function' has access to the package's list of</br>
definitions in the variable `unload-function-defs-list' and could</br>
remove symbols from it in the event that the package has done</br>
something strange, such as redefining an Emacs function.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
