<strong>untrace-function</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>trace.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(untrace-function <u>FUNCTION</u>)</br>
</br>
Untraces <u>FUNCTION</u> and possibly activates all remaining advice.</br>
Activation is performed with `ad-update', hence remaining advice will get</br>
activated only if the advice of <u>FUNCTION</u> is currently active.  If <u>FUNCTION</u></br>
was not traced this is a noop.
