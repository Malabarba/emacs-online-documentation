<strong>untrace-function</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>trace.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(untrace-function FUNCTION)<br/>
<br/>
Untraces FUNCTION and possibly activates all remaining advice.<br/>
Activation is performed with `ad-update', hence remaining advice will get<br/>
activated only if the advice of FUNCTION is currently active.  If FUNCTION<br/>
was not traced this is a noop.
