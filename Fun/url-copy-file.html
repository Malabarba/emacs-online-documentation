<strong>url-copy-file</strong> is an autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>url-handlers.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(url-copy-file URL NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS KEEP-TIME PRESERVE-UID-GID)<br/>
<br/>
Copy URL to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.<br/>
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if file NEWNAME already exists,<br/>
unless a third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is supplied and non-nil.<br/>
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.<br/>
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.<br/>
Fourth arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the new file the same<br/>
last-modified time as the old one.  (This works on only some systems.)<br/>
Fifth arg PRESERVE-UID-GID is ignored.<br/>
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.
