url-hexify-string is an autoloaded Lisp function in `url-util.el'.<br/><br/>(url-hexify-string STRING &optional ALLOWED-CHARS)<br/><br/>URI-encode STRING and return the result.<br/>If STRING is multibyte, it is first converted to a utf-8 byte<br/>string.  Each byte corresponding to an allowed character is left<br/>as-is, while all other bytes are converted to a three-character<br/>string: "%" followed by two upper-case hex digits.<br/><br/>The allowed characters are specified by ALLOWED-CHARS.  If this<br/>argument is nil, the list `url-unreserved-chars' determines the<br/>allowed characters.  Otherwise, ALLOWED-CHARS should be a vector<br/>whose Nth element is non-nil if character N is allowed.
