<strong>url-http-handle-cookies</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>url-http.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(url-http-handle-cookies)<br/>
<br/>
Handle all set-cookie / set-cookie2 headers in an HTTP response.<br/>
The buffer must already be narrowed to the headers, so `mail-fetch-field' will<br/>
work correctly.
