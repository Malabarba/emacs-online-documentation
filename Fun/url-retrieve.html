url-retrieve is an autoloaded Lisp function in `url.el'.<br/><br/>(url-retrieve URL CALLBACK &optional CBARGS SILENT INHIBIT-COOKIES)<br/><br/>Retrieve URL asynchronously and call CALLBACK with CBARGS when finished.<br/>URL is either a string or a parsed URL.  If it is a string<br/>containing characters that are not valid in a URI, those<br/>characters are percent-encoded; see `url-encode-url'.<br/><br/>CALLBACK is called when the object has been completely retrieved, with<br/>the current buffer containing the object, and any MIME headers associated<br/>with it.  It is called as (apply CALLBACK STATUS CBARGS).<br/>STATUS is a plist representing what happened during the request,<br/>with most recent events first, or an empty list if no events have<br/>occurred.  Each pair is one of:<br/><br/>(:redirect REDIRECTED-TO) - the request was redirected to this URL<br/>(:error (ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA)) - an error occurred.  The error can be<br/>signaled with (signal ERROR-SYMBOL DATA).<br/><br/>Return the buffer URL will load into, or nil if the process has<br/>already completed (i.e. URL was a mailto URL or similar; in this case<br/>the callback is not called).<br/><br/>The variables `url-request-data', `url-request-method' and<br/>`url-request-extra-headers' can be dynamically bound around the<br/>request; dynamic binding of other variables doesn't necessarily<br/>take effect.<br/><br/>If SILENT, then don't message progress reports and the like.<br/>If INHIBIT-COOKIES, cookies will neither be stored nor sent to<br/>the server.<br/>If URL is a multibyte string, it will be encoded as utf-8 and<br/>URL-encoded before it's used.
