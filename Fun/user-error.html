<strong>user-error</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(user-error <u>FORMAT</u> &rest <u>ARGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Signal a pilot error, making error message by passing all args to `format'.</br>
In Emacs, the convention is that error messages start with a capital</br>
letter but *do not* end with a period.  Please follow this convention</br>
for the sake of consistency.</br>
This is just like `error' except that `user-error's are expected to be the</br>
result of an incorrect manipulation on the part of the user, rather than the</br>
result of an actual problem.
