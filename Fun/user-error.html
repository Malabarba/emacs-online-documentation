user-error is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(user-error FORMAT &rest ARGS)<br/><br/>Signal a pilot error, making error message by passing all args to `format'.<br/>In Emacs, the convention is that error messages start with a capital<br/>letter but *do not* end with a period.  Please follow this convention<br/>for the sake of consistency.<br/>This is just like `error' except that `user-error's are expected to be the<br/>result of an incorrect manipulation on the part of the user, rather than the<br/>result of an actual problem.
