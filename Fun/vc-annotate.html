<strong>vc-annotate</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>vc-annotate.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
It is bound to C-x v g, &lt;menu-bar> &lt;tools> &lt;vc> &lt;vc-annotate>.</br>
</br>
<code>(vc-annotate <u>FILE</u> <u>REV</u> <em>&optional</em> <u>DISPLAY-MODE</u> <u>BUF</u> <u>MOVE-POINT-TO</u> <u>VC-BK</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Display the edit history of the current <u>FILE</u> using colors.</br>
</br>
This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current</br>
file, when it was last edited and by whom.  Additionally, colors are</br>
used to show the age of each line--blue means oldest, red means</br>
youngest, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By</br>
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;</br>
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.</br>
</br>
With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the</br>
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a revision number <u>REV</u>; then the buffer</br>
displays and annotates that revision instead of the working revision</br>
(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,</br>
you are prompted for the time span in days which the color range</br>
should cover.  For example, a time span of 20 days means that changes</br>
over the past 20 days are shown in red to blue, according to their</br>
age, and everything that is older than that is shown in blue.</br>
</br>
If <u>MOVE-POINT-TO</u> is given, move the point to that line.</br>
</br>
If <u>VC-BK</u> is given used that VC backend.</br>
</br>
Customization variables:</br>
</br>
`vc-annotate-menu-elements' customizes the menu elements of the</br>
mode-specific menu.  `vc-annotate-color-map' and</br>
`vc-annotate-very-old-color' define the mapping of time to colors.</br>
`vc-annotate-background' specifies the background color.
