<strong>vc-annotate</strong> is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `<code>vc-annotate.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x v g, <menu-bar> <tools> <vc> <vc-annotate>.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-annotate FILE REV &optional DISPLAY-MODE BUF MOVE-POINT-TO VC-BK)<br/>
<br/>
Display the edit history of the current FILE using colors.<br/>
<br/>
This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current<br/>
file, when it was last edited and by whom.  Additionally, colors are<br/>
used to show the age of each line--blue means oldest, red means<br/>
youngest, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By<br/>
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;<br/>
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.<br/>
<br/>
With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the<br/>
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a revision number REV; then the buffer<br/>
displays and annotates that revision instead of the working revision<br/>
(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,<br/>
you are prompted for the time span in days which the color range<br/>
should cover.  For example, a time span of 20 days means that changes<br/>
over the past 20 days are shown in red to blue, according to their<br/>
age, and everything that is older than that is shown in blue.<br/>
<br/>
If MOVE-POINT-TO is given, move the point to that line.<br/>
<br/>
If VC-BK is given used that VC backend.<br/>
