<strong>vc-check-master-templates</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vc-check-master-templates <u>FILE</u> <u>TEMPLATES</u>)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if there is a master corresponding to <u>FILE</u>.</br>
</br>
<u>TEMPLATES</u> is a list of strings or functions.  If an element is a</br>
string, it must be a control string as required by `format', with two</br>
string placeholders, such as "%sRCS/%s,v".  The directory part of</br>
<u>FILE</u> is substituted for the first placeholder, the basename of <u>FILE</u></br>
for the second.  If a file with the resulting name exists, it is taken</br>
as the master of <u>FILE</u>, and returned.</br>
</br>
If an element of <u>TEMPLATES</u> is a function, it is called with the</br>
directory part and the basename of <u>FILE</u> as arguments.  It should</br>
return non-nil if it finds a master; that value is then returned by</br>
this function.
