<strong>vc-check-master-templates</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-check-master-templates FILE TEMPLATES)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if there is a master corresponding to FILE.<br/>
<br/>
TEMPLATES is a list of strings or functions.  If an element is a<br/>
string, it must be a control string as required by `format', with two<br/>
string placeholders, such as "%sRCS/%s,v".  The directory part of<br/>
FILE is substituted for the first placeholder, the basename of FILE<br/>
for the second.  If a file with the resulting name exists, it is taken<br/>
as the master of FILE, and returned.<br/>
<br/>
If an element of TEMPLATES is a function, it is called with the<br/>
directory part and the basename of FILE as arguments.  It should<br/>
return non-nil if it finds a master; that value is then returned by<br/>
this function.
