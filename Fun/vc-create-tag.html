<strong>vc-create-tag</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to C-x v s, <menu-bar> <tools> <vc> <vc-create-tag>.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-create-tag DIR NAME BRANCHP)<br/>
<br/>
Descending recursively from DIR, make a tag called NAME.<br/>
For each registered file, the working revision becomes part of<br/>
the named configuration.  If the prefix argument BRANCHP is<br/>
given, the tag is made as a new branch and the files are<br/>
checked out in that new branch.
