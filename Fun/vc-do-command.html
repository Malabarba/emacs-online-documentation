<strong>vc-do-command</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-dispatcher.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vc-do-command <u>BUFFER</u> <u>OKSTATUS</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>FILE-OR-LIST</u> &rest <u>FLAGS</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute a slave command, notifying user and checking for errors.</br>
Output from <u>COMMAND</u> goes to <u>BUFFER</u>, or the current buffer if</br>
<u>BUFFER</u> is t.  If the destination buffer is not already current,</br>
set it up properly and erase it.  The command is considered</br>
successful if its exit status does not exceed <u>OKSTATUS</u> (if</br>
<u>OKSTATUS</u> is nil, that means to ignore error status, if it is</br>
`async', that means not to wait for termination of the</br>
subprocess; if it is t it means to ignore all execution errors).</br>
<u>FILE-OR-LIST</u> is the name of a working file; it may be a list of</br>
files or be nil (to execute commands that don't expect a file</br>
name or set of files).  If an optional list of <u>FLAGS</u> is present,</br>
that is inserted into the command line before the filename.</br>
Return the return value of the slave command in the synchronous</br>
case, and the process object in the asynchronous case.
