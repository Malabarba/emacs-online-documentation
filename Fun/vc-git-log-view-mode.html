<strong>vc-git-log-view-mode</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-git.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(vc-git-log-view-mode)</br>
</br>
Parent mode: `log-view-mode'.</br>
</br>
Major mode derived from `log-view-mode' by `define-derived-mode'.</br>
It inherits all of the parent's attributes, but has its own keymap,</br>
abbrev table and syntax table:</br>
</br>
  `vc-git-log-view-mode-map', `vc-git-log-view-mode-abbrev-table' and `vc-git-log-view-mode-syntax-table'</br>
</br>
which more-or-less shadow log-view-mode's corresponding tables.</br>
</br>
In addition to any hooks its parent mode might have run,</br>
this mode runs the hook `vc-git-log-view-mode-hook', as the final step</br>
during initialization.</br>
