<strong>vc-insert-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vc-insert-file <u>FILE</u> &optional <u>LIMIT</u> <u>BLOCKSIZE</u>)</br>
</br>
Insert the contents of <u>FILE</u> into the current buffer.</br>
</br>
Optional argument <u>LIMIT</u> is a regexp.  If present, the file is inserted</br>
in chunks of size <u>BLOCKSIZE</u> (default 8 kByte), until the first</br>
occurrence of <u>LIMIT</u> is found.  Anything from the start of that occurrence</br>
to the end of the buffer is then deleted.  The function returns</br>
non-nil if <u>FILE</u> exists and its contents were successfully inserted.
