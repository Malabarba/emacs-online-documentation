<strong>vc-insert-file</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-insert-file FILE &optional LIMIT BLOCKSIZE)<br/>
<br/>
Insert the contents of FILE into the current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument LIMIT is a regexp.  If present, the file is inserted<br/>
in chunks of size BLOCKSIZE (default 8 kByte), until the first<br/>
occurrence of LIMIT is found.  Anything from the start of that occurrence<br/>
to the end of the buffer is then deleted.  The function returns<br/>
non-nil if FILE exists and its contents were successfully inserted.
