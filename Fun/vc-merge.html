<br/>
Perform a version control merge operation.<br/>
You must be visiting a version controlled file, or in a `vc-dir' buffer.<br/>
On a distributed version control system, this runs a "merge"<br/>
operation to incorporate changes from another branch onto the<br/>
current branch, prompting for an argument list.<br/>
<br/>
On a non-distributed version control system, this merges changes<br/>
between two revisions into the current fileset.  This asks for<br/>
two revisions to merge from in the minibuffer.  If the first<br/>
revision is a branch number, then merge all changes from that<br/>
branch.  If the first revision is empty, merge the most recent<br/>
changes from the current branch.
