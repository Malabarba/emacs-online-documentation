</br>
It is bound to C-x v v, &lt;menu-bar> &lt;tools> &lt;vc> &lt;vc-next-action>.</br>
</br>
<code>(vc-next-action <u>VERBOSE</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Do the next logical version control operation on the current fileset.</br>
This requires that all files in the current VC fileset be in the</br>
same state.  If not, signal an error.</br>
</br>
For merging-based version control systems:</br>
  If every file in the VC fileset is not registered for version</br>
   control, register the fileset (but don't commit).</br>
  If every work file in the VC fileset is added or changed, pop</br>
   up a *vc-log* buffer to commit the fileset.</br>
  For a centralized version control system, if any work file in</br>
   the VC fileset is out of date, offer to update the fileset.</br>
</br>
For old-style locking-based version control systems, like RCS:</br>
  If every file is not registered, register the file(s).</br>
  If every file is registered and unlocked, check out (lock)</br>
   the file(s) for editing.</br>
  If every file is locked by you and has changes, pop up a</br>
   *vc-log* buffer to check in the changes.  If the variable</br>
   `vc-keep-workfiles' is non-nil (the default), leave a</br>
   read-only copy of each changed file after checking in.</br>
  If every file is locked by you and unchanged, unlock them.</br>
  If every file is locked by someone else, offer to steal the lock.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
