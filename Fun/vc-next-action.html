vc-next-action is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `vc.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x v v, <menu-bar> <tools> <vc> <vc-next-action>.<br/><br/>(vc-next-action VERBOSE)<br/><br/>Do the next logical version control operation on the current fileset.<br/>This requires that all files in the current VC fileset be in the<br/>same state.  If not, signal an error.<br/><br/>For merging-based version control systems:<br/>  If every file in the VC fileset is not registered for version<br/>   control, register the fileset (but don't commit).<br/>  If every work file in the VC fileset is added or changed, pop<br/>   up a *vc-log* buffer to commit the fileset.<br/>  For a centralized version control system, if any work file in<br/>   the VC fileset is out of date, offer to update the fileset.<br/><br/>For old-style locking-based version control systems, like RCS:<br/>  If every file is not registered, register the file(s).<br/>  If every file is registered and unlocked, check out (lock)<br/>   the file(s) for editing.<br/>  If every file is locked by you and has changes, pop up a<br/>   *vc-log* buffer to check in the changes.  If the variable<br/>   `vc-keep-workfiles' is non-nil (the default), leave a<br/>   read-only copy of each changed file after checking in.<br/>  If every file is locked by you and unchanged, unlock them.<br/>  If every file is locked by someone else, offer to steal the lock.
