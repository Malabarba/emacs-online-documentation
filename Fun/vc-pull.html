<strong>vc-pull</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-pull &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Update the current fileset or branch.<br/>
You must be visiting a version controlled file, or in a `vc-dir' buffer.<br/>
On a distributed version control system, this runs a "pull"<br/>
operation to update the current branch, prompting for an argument<br/>
list if required.  Optional prefix ARG forces a prompt.<br/>
<br/>
On a non-distributed version control system, update the current<br/>
fileset to the tip revisions.  For each unchanged and unlocked<br/>
file, this simply replaces the work file with the latest revision<br/>
on its branch.  If the file contains changes, any changes in the<br/>
tip revision are merged into the working file.
