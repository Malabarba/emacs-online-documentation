vc-register is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `vc.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x v i, <menu-bar> <tools> <vc> <vc-register>.<br/><br/>(vc-register &optional SET-REVISION VC-FILESET COMMENT)<br/><br/>Register into a version control system.<br/>If VC-FILESET is given, register the files in that fileset.<br/>Otherwise register the current file.<br/>With prefix argument SET-REVISION, allow user to specify initial revision<br/>level.  If COMMENT is present, use that as an initial comment.<br/><br/>The version control system to use is found by cycling through the list<br/>`vc-handled-backends'.  The first backend in that list which declares<br/>itself responsible for the file (usually because other files in that<br/>directory are already registered under that backend) will be used to<br/>register the file.  If no backend declares itself responsible, the<br/>first backend that could register the file is used.
