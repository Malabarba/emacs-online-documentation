<strong>vc-registered</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vc-registered <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return non-nil if <u>FILE</u> is registered in a version control system.</br>
</br>
This function performs the check each time it is called.  To rely</br>
on the result of a previous call, use `vc-backend' instead.  If the</br>
file was previously registered under a certain backend, then that</br>
backend is tried first.
