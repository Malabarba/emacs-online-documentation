<strong>vc-registered</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-registered FILE)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if FILE is registered in a version control system.<br/>
<br/>
This function performs the check each time it is called.  To rely<br/>
on the result of a previous call, use `vc-backend' instead.  If the<br/>
file was previously registered under a certain backend, then that<br/>
backend is tried first.
