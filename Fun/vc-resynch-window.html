<strong>vc-resynch-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-dispatcher.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vc-resynch-window <u>FILE</u> &optional <u>KEEP</u> <u>NOQUERY</u> <u>RESET-VC-INFO</u>)</br>
</br>
If <u>FILE</u> is in the current buffer, either revert or unvisit it.</br>
The choice between revert (to see expanded keywords) and unvisit</br>
depends on <u>KEEP</u>.  <u>NOQUERY</u> if non-nil inhibits confirmation for</br>
reverting.  <u>NOQUERY</u> should be t *only* if it is known the only</br>
difference between the buffer and the file is due to</br>
modifications by the dispatcher client code, rather than user</br>
editing!
