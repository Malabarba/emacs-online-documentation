<strong>vc-resynch-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-dispatcher.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-resynch-window FILE &optional KEEP NOQUERY RESET-VC-INFO)<br/>
<br/>
If FILE is in the current buffer, either revert or unvisit it.<br/>
The choice between revert (to see expanded keywords) and unvisit<br/>
depends on KEEP.  NOQUERY if non-nil inhibits confirmation for<br/>
reverting.  NOQUERY should be t *only* if it is known the only<br/>
difference between the buffer and the file is due to<br/>
modifications by the dispatcher client code, rather than user<br/>
editing!
