<strong>vc-start-logentry</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vc-dispatcher.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vc-start-logentry FILES COMMENT INITIAL-CONTENTS MSG LOGBUF MODE ACTION &optional AFTER-HOOK BACKEND)<br/>
<br/>
Accept a comment for an operation on FILES.<br/>
If COMMENT is nil, pop up a LOGBUF buffer, emit MSG, and set the<br/>
action on close to ACTION.  If COMMENT is a string and<br/>
INITIAL-CONTENTS is non-nil, then COMMENT is used as the initial<br/>
contents of the log entry buffer.  If COMMENT is a string and<br/>
INITIAL-CONTENTS is nil, do action immediately as if the user had<br/>
entered COMMENT.  If COMMENT is t, also do action immediately with an<br/>
empty comment.  Remember the file's buffer in `vc-parent-buffer'<br/>
(current one if no file).  Puts the log-entry buffer in major-mode<br/>
MODE, defaulting to `log-edit-mode' if MODE is nil.<br/>
AFTER-HOOK specifies the local value for `vc-log-after-operation-hook'.<br/>
BACKEND, if non-nil, specifies a VC backend for the Log Edit buffer.
