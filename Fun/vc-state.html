vc-state is a compiled Lisp function in `vc-hooks.el'.<br/><br/>(vc-state FILE &optional BACKEND)<br/><br/>Return the version control state of FILE.<br/><br/>A return of nil from this function means we have no information on the<br/>status of this file.  Otherwise, the value returned is one of:<br/><br/>  'up-to-date        The working file is unmodified with respect to the<br/>                     latest version on the current branch, and not locked.<br/><br/>  'edited            The working file has been edited by the user.  If<br/>                     locking is used for the file, this state means that<br/>                     the current version is locked by the calling user.<br/>                     This status should *not* be reported for files<br/>                     which have a changed mtime but the same content<br/>                     as the repo copy.<br/><br/>  USER               The current version of the working file is locked by<br/>                     some other USER (a string).<br/><br/>  'needs-update      The file has not been edited by the user, but there is<br/>                     a more recent version on the current branch stored<br/>                     in the repository.<br/><br/>  'needs-merge       The file has been edited by the user, and there is also<br/>                     a more recent version on the current branch stored in<br/>                     the repository.  This state can only occur if locking<br/>                     is not used for the file.<br/><br/>  'unlocked-changes  The working version of the file is not locked,<br/>                     but the working file has been changed with respect<br/>                     to that version.  This state can only occur for files<br/>                     with locking; it represents an erroneous condition that<br/>                     should be resolved by the user (vc-next-action will<br/>                     prompt the user to do it).<br/><br/>  'added             Scheduled to go into the repository on the next commit.<br/>                     Often represented by vc-working-revision = "0" in VCSes<br/>                     with monotonic IDs like Subversion and Mercurial.<br/><br/>  'removed           Scheduled to be deleted from the repository on next commit.<br/><br/>  'conflict          The file contains conflicts as the result of a merge.<br/>                     For now the conflicts are text conflicts.  In the<br/>                     future this might be extended to deal with metadata<br/>                     conflicts too.<br/><br/>  'missing           The file is not present in the file system, but the VC<br/>                     system still tracks it.<br/><br/>  'ignored           The file showed up in a dir-status listing with a flag<br/>                     indicating the version-control system is ignoring it,<br/>                     Note: This property is not set reliably (some VCSes<br/>                     don't have useful directory-status commands) so assume<br/>                     that any file with vc-state nil might be ignorable<br/>                     without VC knowing it.<br/><br/>  'unregistered      The file is not under version control.
