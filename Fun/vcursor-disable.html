<strong>vcursor-disable</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>vcursor.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(vcursor-disable &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Disable the virtual cursor.</br>
Next time you use it, it will start from point.</br>
</br>
With a positive prefix <u>ARG</u>, the first window in cyclic order</br>
displaying the virtual cursor (or which was recently displaying the</br>
virtual cursor) will be deleted unless it's the selected window.</br>
</br>
With a negative prefix argument, enable the virtual cursor: make it</br>
active at the same point as the real cursor.</br>
</br>
Copying mode is always turned off: the next use of the vcursor will</br>
not copy text until you turn it on again.
