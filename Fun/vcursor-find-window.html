<strong>vcursor-find-window</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vcursor.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vcursor-find-window &optional <u>NOT-THIS</u> <u>NEW-WIN</u> <u>THIS-FRAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Return a suitable window for displaying the virtual cursor.</br>
This is the first window in cyclic order where the vcursor is visible.</br>
</br>
With optional <u>NOT-THIS</u> non-nil never return the current window.</br>
</br>
With <u>NEW-WIN</u> non-nil, display the virtual cursor buffer in another</br>
window if the virtual cursor is not currently visible (note, however,</br>
that this function never changes `window-point').</br>
</br>
With <u>THIS-FRAME</u> non-nil, don't search other frames for a new window</br>
(though if the vcursor is already off-frame then its current window is</br>
always considered, and the value of `pop-up-frames' is always respected).</br>
</br>
Returns nil if the virtual cursor is not visible anywhere suitable.</br>
Set `vcursor-window' to the returned value as a side effect.
