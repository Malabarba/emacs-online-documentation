<strong>verilog-auto-insert-last</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(verilog-auto-insert-last)</br>
</br>
Expand AUTOINSERTLAST statements, as part of M-x verilog-auto.</br>
The Lisp code provided is called after all other AUTOS have been</br>
expanded, and the Lisp code generally will call `insert` to</br>
insert text into the current file beginning on the line after the</br>
AUTOINSERTLAST.</br>
</br>
Other than when called (after AUTOs are expanded), the functionality</br>
is otherwise identical to AUTOINSERTLISP and `verilog-auto-insert-lisp' which</br>
executes before (as opposed to after) other AUTOs.</br>
</br>
See `verilog-auto-insert-lisp' for examples.
