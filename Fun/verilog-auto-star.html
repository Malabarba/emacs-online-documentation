verilog-auto-star is a compiled Lisp function in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(verilog-auto-star)<br/><br/>Expand SystemVerilog .* pins, as part of M-x verilog-auto.<br/><br/>If `verilog-auto-star-expand' is set, .* pins are treated if they were<br/>AUTOINST statements, otherwise they are ignored.  For safety, Verilog mode<br/>will also ignore any .* that are not last in your pin list (this prevents<br/>it from deleting pins following the .* when it expands the AUTOINST.)<br/><br/>On writing your file, unless `verilog-auto-star-save' is set, any<br/>non-templated expanded pins will be removed.  You may do this at any time<br/>with M-x verilog-delete-auto-star-implicit.<br/><br/>If you are converting a module to use .* for the first time, you may wish<br/>to use M-x verilog-inject-auto and then replace the created AUTOINST with .*.<br/><br/>See `verilog-auto-inst' for examples, templates, and more information.
