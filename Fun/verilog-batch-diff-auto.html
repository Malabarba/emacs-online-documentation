<strong>verilog-batch-diff-auto</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(verilog-batch-diff-auto)<br/>
<br/>
For use with --batch, perform automatic differences as a stand-alone tool.<br/>
This sets up the appropriate Verilog mode environment, expand automatics<br/>
with M-x verilog-diff-auto on all command-line files, and reports an error<br/>
if any differences are observed.  This is appropriate for adding to regressions<br/>
to insure automatics are always properly maintained.
