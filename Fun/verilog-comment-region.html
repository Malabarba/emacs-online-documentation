<strong>verilog-comment-region</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(verilog-comment-region START END)<br/>
<br/>
Put the region into a Verilog comment.<br/>
The comments that are in this area are "deformed":<br/>
`*)' becomes `!(*' and `}' becomes `!{'.<br/>
These deformed comments are returned to normal if you use<br/>
M-x verilog-uncomment-region to undo the commenting.<br/>
<br/>
The commented area starts with `verilog-exclude-str-start', and ends with<br/>
`verilog-exclude-str-end'.  But if you change these variables,<br/>
M-x verilog-uncomment-region won't recognize the comments.
