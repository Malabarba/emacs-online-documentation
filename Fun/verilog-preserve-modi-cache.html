verilog-preserve-modi-cache is a Lisp macro in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(verilog-preserve-modi-cache &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Execute the BODY forms, allowing cache preservation within BODY.<br/>This means that changes to the buffer will not result in the cache being<br/>flushed.  If the changes affect the modsig state, they must call the<br/>modsig-cache-add-* function, else the results of later calls may be<br/>incorrect.  Without this, changes are assumed to be adding/removing signals<br/>and invalidating the cache.
