<strong>verilog-re-search-backward-quick</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(verilog-re-search-backward-quick REGEXP BOUND NOERROR)<br/>
<br/>
Like `verilog-re-search-backward', including use of REGEXP BOUND and NOERROR,<br/>
but trashes match data and is faster for REGEXP that doesn't match often.<br/>
This uses `verilog-scan' and text properties to ignore comments,<br/>
so there may be a large up front penalty for the first search.
