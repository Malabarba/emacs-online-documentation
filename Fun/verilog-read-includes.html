<strong>verilog-read-includes</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(verilog-read-includes)<br/>
<br/>
Read `includes for the current file.<br/>
This will find all of the `includes which are at the beginning of lines,<br/>
ignoring any ifdefs or multiline comments around them.<br/>
`verilog-read-defines' is then performed on the current and each included<br/>
file.<br/>
<br/>
It is often useful put at the *END* of your file something like:<br/>
<br/>
    // Local Variables:<br/>
    // eval:(verilog-read-defines)<br/>
    // eval:(verilog-read-includes)<br/>
    // End:<br/>
<br/>
Note includes are only read when the file is first visited, you must use<br/>
C-x C-v RET  to have these take effect after editing them!<br/>
<br/>
It is good to get in the habit of including all needed files in each .v<br/>
file that needs it, rather than waiting for compile time.  This will aid<br/>
this process, Verilint, and readability.  To prevent defining the same<br/>
variable over and over when many modules are compiled together, put a test<br/>
around the inside each include file:<br/>
<br/>
foo.v (an include file):<br/>
	`ifdef _FOO_V	// include if not already included<br/>
	`else<br/>
	`define _FOO_V<br/>
	... contents of file<br/>
	`endif // _FOO_V
