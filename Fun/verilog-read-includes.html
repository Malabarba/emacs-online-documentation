</br>
(verilog-read-includes)</br>
</br>
Read `includes for the current file.</br>
This will find all of the `includes which are at the beginning of lines,</br>
ignoring any ifdefs or multiline comments around them.</br>
`verilog-read-defines' is then performed on the current and each included</br>
file.</br>
</br>
It is often useful put at the *END* of your file something like:</br>
</br>
    // Local Variables:</br>
    // eval:(verilog-read-defines)</br>
    // eval:(verilog-read-includes)</br>
    // End:</br>
</br>
Note includes are only read when the file is first visited, you must use</br>
C-x C-v RET  to have these take effect after editing them!</br>
</br>
It is good to get in the habit of including all needed files in each .v</br>
file that needs it, rather than waiting for compile time.  This will aid</br>
this process, Verilint, and readability.  To prevent defining the same</br>
variable over and over when many modules are compiled together, put a test</br>
around the inside each include file:</br>
</br>
foo.v (an include file):</br>
	`ifdef _FOO_V	// include if not already included</br>
	`else</br>
	`define _FOO_V</br>
	... contents of file</br>
	`endif // _FOO_V<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
