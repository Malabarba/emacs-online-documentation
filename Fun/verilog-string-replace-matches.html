<strong>verilog-string-replace-matches</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(verilog-string-replace-matches FROM-STRING TO-STRING FIXEDCASE LITERAL STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Replace occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.<br/>
FIXEDCASE and LITERAL as in `replace-match`.  STRING is what to replace.<br/>
The case (verilog-string-replace-matches "o" "oo" nil nil "foobar")<br/>
will break, as the o's continuously replace.  xa -> x works ok though.
