<strong>version-list-<</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(version-list-< L1 L2)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if L1, a list specification of a version, is lower than L2.<br/>
<br/>
Note that a version specified by the list (1) is equal to (1 0),<br/>
(1 0 0), (1 0 0 0), etc.  That is, the trailing zeros are insignificant.<br/>
Also, a version given by the list (1) is higher than (1 -1), which in<br/>
turn is higher than (1 -2), which is higher than (1 -3).
