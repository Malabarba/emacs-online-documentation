<strong>version<</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(version< V1 V2)<br/>
<br/>
Return t if version V1 is lower (older) than V2.<br/>
<br/>
Note that version string "1" is equal to "1.0", "1.0.0", "1.0.0.0",<br/>
etc.  That is, the trailing ".0"s are insignificant.  Also, version<br/>
string "1" is higher (newer) than "1pre", which is higher than "1beta",<br/>
which is higher than "1alpha".  Also, "-CVS" and "-NNN" are treated<br/>
as alpha versions.
