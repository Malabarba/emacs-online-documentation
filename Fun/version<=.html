<strong>version&lt;=</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(version&lt;= <u>V1</u> <u>V2</u>)</br>
</br>
Return t if version <u>V1</u> is lower (older) than or equal to <u>V2</u>.</br>
</br>
Note that version string "1" is equal to "1.0", "1.0.0", "1.0.0.0",</br>
etc.  That is, the trailing ".0"s are insignificant.  Also, version</br>
string "1" is higher (newer) than "1pre", which is higher than "1beta",</br>
which is higher than "1alpha", which is higher than "1snapshot".</br>
Also, "-GIT", "-CVS" and "-NNN" are treated as snapshot versions.
