<strong>vertical-motion</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(vertical-motion <u>LINES</u> &optional <u>WINDOW</u>)</br>
</br>
Move point to start of the screen line <u>LINES</u> lines down.</br>
If <u>LINES</u> is negative, this means moving up.</br>
</br>
This function is an ordinary cursor motion function</br>
which calculates the new position based on how text would be displayed.</br>
The new position may be the start of a line,</br>
or just the start of a continuation line.</br>
The function returns number of screen lines moved over;</br>
that usually equals <u>LINES</u>, but may be closer to zero</br>
if beginning or end of buffer was reached.</br>
</br>
The optional second argument <u>WINDOW</u> specifies the window to use for</br>
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.</br>
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.</br>
</br>
<u>LINES</u> can optionally take the form (COLS . <u>LINES</u>), in which case</br>
the motion will not stop at the start of a screen line but on</br>
its column COLS (if such exists on that line, that is).</br>
</br>
`vertical-motion' always uses the current buffer,</br>
regardless of which buffer is displayed in <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
This is consistent with other cursor motion functions</br>
and makes it possible to use `vertical-motion' in any buffer,</br>
whether or not it is currently displayed in some window.
