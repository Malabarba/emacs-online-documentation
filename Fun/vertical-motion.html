<strong>vertical-motion</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vertical-motion LINES &optional WINDOW)<br/>
<br/>
Move point to start of the screen line LINES lines down.<br/>
If LINES is negative, this means moving up.<br/>
<br/>
This function is an ordinary cursor motion function<br/>
which calculates the new position based on how text would be displayed.<br/>
The new position may be the start of a line,<br/>
or just the start of a continuation line.<br/>
The function returns number of screen lines moved over;<br/>
that usually equals LINES, but may be closer to zero<br/>
if beginning or end of buffer was reached.<br/>
<br/>
The optional second argument WINDOW specifies the window to use for<br/>
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.<br/>
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.<br/>
<br/>
LINES can optionally take the form (COLS . LINES), in which case<br/>
the motion will not stop at the start of a screen line but on<br/>
its column COLS (if such exists on that line, that is).<br/>
<br/>
`vertical-motion' always uses the current buffer,<br/>
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.<br/>
This is consistent with other cursor motion functions<br/>
and makes it possible to use `vertical-motion' in any buffer,<br/>
whether or not it is currently displayed in some window.
