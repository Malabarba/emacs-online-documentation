<strong>vhdl-beginning-of-libunit</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>vhdl-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(vhdl-beginning-of-libunit)<br/>
<br/>
Move backward to the beginning of a VHDL library unit.<br/>
Returns the location of the corresponding begin keyword, unless search<br/>
stops due to beginning or end of buffer.<br/>
Note that if point is between the "libunit" keyword and the<br/>
corresponding "begin" keyword, then that libunit will not be<br/>
recognized, and the search will continue backwards.  If point is<br/>
at the "begin" keyword, then the defun will be recognized.  The<br/>
returned point is at the first character of the "libunit" keyword.
