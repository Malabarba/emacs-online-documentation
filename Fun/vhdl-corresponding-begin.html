vhdl-corresponding-begin is a compiled Lisp function in `vhdl-mode.el'.<br/><br/>(vhdl-corresponding-begin &optional LIM)<br/><br/>If the word at the current position corresponds to an "end"<br/>keyword, then return a vector containing enough information to find<br/>the corresponding "begin" keyword, else return nil.  The keyword to<br/>search backward for is aref 0.  The column in which the keyword must<br/>appear is aref 1 or nil if any column is suitable.  The supplementary<br/>keyword to search forward for is aref 2 or nil if this is not<br/>required.  If aref 3 is t, then the "begin" keyword may be found in<br/>the middle of a statement.<br/>Assumes that the caller will make sure that we are not in the middle<br/>of an identifier that just happens to contain an "end" keyword.
