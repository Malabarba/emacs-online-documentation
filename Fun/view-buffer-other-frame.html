<strong>view-buffer-other-frame</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(view-buffer-other-frame BUFFER &optional NOT-RETURN EXIT-ACTION)<br/>
<br/>
View BUFFER in View mode in another frame.<br/>
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available;<br/>
instead, a special set of commands (mostly letters and<br/>
punctuation) are defined for moving around in the buffer.<br/>
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.<br/>
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.<br/>
<br/>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument NOT-RETURN is ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument EXIT-ACTION is either nil or a function with buffer as<br/>
argument.  This function is called when finished viewing buffer.  Use<br/>
this argument instead of explicitly setting `view-exit-action'.<br/>
<br/>
This function does not enable View mode if the buffer's major-mode<br/>
has a `special' mode-class, because such modes usually have their<br/>
own View-like bindings.
