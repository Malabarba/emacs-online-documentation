<strong>view-buffer</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(view-buffer <u>BUFFER</u> &optional <u>EXIT-ACTION</u>)</br>
</br>
View <u>BUFFER</u> in View mode, returning to previous buffer when done.</br>
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead, a</br>
special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation) are defined for</br>
moving around in the buffer.</br>
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.</br>
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</br>
</br>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.</br>
</br>
Optional argument <u>EXIT-ACTION</u> is either nil or a function with buffer as</br>
argument.  This function is called when finished viewing buffer.  Use</br>
this argument instead of explicitly setting `view-exit-action'.</br>
</br>
Do not set <u>EXIT-ACTION</u> to `kill-buffer' when <u>BUFFER</u> visits a</br>
file: Users may suspend viewing in order to modify the buffer.</br>
Exiting View mode will then discard the user's edits.  Setting</br>
<u>EXIT-ACTION</u> to `kill-buffer-if-not-modified' avoids this.</br>
</br>
This function does not enable View mode if the buffer's major-mode</br>
has a `special' mode-class, because such modes usually have their</br>
own View-like bindings.
