<strong>view-file-other-frame</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(view-file-other-frame <u>FILE</u>)</br>
</br>
View <u>FILE</u> in View mode in another frame.</br>
When done, kill the buffer visiting <u>FILE</u> if unmodified and if it wasn't</br>
visited before; also, maybe delete other frame and/or return to previous</br>
buffer.</br>
</br>
Emacs commands editing the buffer contents are not available; instead,</br>
a special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation)</br>
are defined for moving around in the buffer.</br>
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.</br>
For a list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.</br>
</br>
This command runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.
