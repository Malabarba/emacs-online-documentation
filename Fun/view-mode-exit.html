<strong>view-mode-exit</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(view-mode-exit &optional <u>EXIT-ONLY</u> <u>EXIT-ACTION</u> <u>ALL-WINDOWS</u>)</br>
</br>
Exit View mode in various ways.</br>
If all arguments are nil, remove the current buffer from the</br>
selected window using the `quit-restore' information associated</br>
with the selected window.  If optional argument <u>ALL-WINDOWS</u> or</br>
`view-exits-all-viewing-windows' are non-nil, remove the current</br>
buffer from all windows showing it.</br>
</br>
Optional argument <u>EXIT-ONLY</u> non-nil means just exit `view-mode'</br>
(unless `view-no-disable-on-exit' is non-nil) but do not change</br>
the associations of any windows with the current buffer.</br>
</br>
<u>EXIT-ACTION</u>, if non-nil, must specify a function that is called</br>
with the current buffer as argument and is called after disabling</br>
`view-mode' and removing any associations of windows with the</br>
current buffer.
