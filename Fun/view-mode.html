<strong>view-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>view.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(view-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle View mode, a minor mode for viewing text but not editing it.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable View mode if <u>ARG</u> is positive,</br>
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable View mode</br>
if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.</br>
</br>
When View mode is enabled, commands that do not change the buffer</br>
contents are available as usual.  Kill commands insert text in</br>
kill buffers but do not delete.  Most other commands beep and</br>
tell the user that the buffer is read-only.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
The following additional commands are provided.  Most commands</br>
take prefix arguments.  Page commands default to "page size"</br>
lines which is almost a whole window, or number of lines set by</br>
z or w.</br>
Half page commands default to and set "half page size" lines</br>
which initially is half a window full.  Search commands default</br>
to a repeat count of one.</br>
</br>
H, h, ?	 This message.</br>
Digits	provide prefix arguments.</br>
-	negative prefix argument.</br>
&lt;	move to the beginning of buffer.</br>
>	move to the end of buffer.</br>
o	scroll so that buffer end is at last line of window.</br>
SPC	scroll forward "page size" lines.</br>
	  With prefix scroll forward prefix lines.</br>
DEL, S-SPC  scroll backward "page size" lines.</br>
	      With prefix scroll backward prefix lines.</br>
z	like  SPC  but with prefix sets "page size" to prefix.</br>
w	like  DEL  but with prefix sets "page size" to prefix.</br>
d	scroll forward "half page size" lines.  With prefix, sets</br>
	  "half page size" to prefix lines and scrolls forward that much.</br>
u	scroll backward "half page size" lines.  With prefix, sets</br>
	  "half page size" to prefix lines and scrolls backward that much.</br>
RET, LFD  scroll forward one line.  With prefix scroll forward prefix line(s).</br>
y	scroll backward one line.  With prefix scroll backward prefix line(s).</br>
F	revert-buffer if necessary and scroll forward.</br>
	  Use this to view a changing file.</br>
=	prints the current line number.</br>
%	goes prefix argument (default 100) percent into buffer.</br>
g	goes to line given by prefix argument (default first line).</br>
.	set the mark.</br>
x	exchanges point and mark.</br>
@	return to mark and pops mark ring.</br>
	  Mark ring is pushed at start of every successful search and when</br>
	  jump to line occurs.  The mark is set on jump to buffer start or end.</br>
m	save current position in character register.</br>
'	go to position saved in character register.</br>
s	do forward incremental search.</br>
r	do reverse incremental search.</br>
/	searches forward for regular expression, starting after current page.</br>
	  ! and @ have a special meaning at the beginning of the regexp.</br>
	  ! means search for a line with no match for regexp.  @ means start</br>
	  search at beginning (end for backward search) of buffer.</br>
\	searches backward for regular expression, starting before current page.</br>
n	searches forward for last regular expression.</br>
p	searches backward for last regular expression.</br>
q	quit View mode, restoring this window and buffer to previous state.</br>
	  q is the normal way to leave view mode.</br>
e	exit View mode but stay in current buffer.  Use this if you started</br>
	  viewing a buffer (file) and find out you want to edit it.</br>
	  This command restores the previous read-only status of the buffer.</br>
E	exit View mode, and make the current buffer editable</br>
	  even if it was not editable before entry to View mode.</br>
Q	quit View mode, restoring all windows to previous state.</br>
c	quit View mode and maybe switch buffers, but don't kill this buffer.</br>
C	quit View mode, kill current buffer and go back to other buffer.</br>
</br>
The effect of c, q and C depends on how view-mode was entered.  If it was</br>
entered by view-file, view-file-other-window, view-file-other-frame, or</br>
M-x dired-view-file (M-x view-file, M-x view-file-other-window,</br>
M-x view-file-other-frame, or the Dired mode v command),</br>
then q will try to kill the current buffer.</br>
If view-mode was entered from another buffer, by M-x view-buffer,</br>
M-x view-buffer-other-window, M-x view-buffer-other frame, M-x view-file,</br>
M-x view-file-other-window, or M-x view-file-other-frame,</br>
then c, q and C will return to that buffer.</br>
</br>
Entry to view-mode runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.
