viper-ESC is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `viper-cmd.el'.<br/><br/>(viper-ESC ARG)<br/><br/>Emulate ESC key in Emacs.<br/>Prevents multiple escape keystrokes if viper-no-multiple-ESC is true.<br/>If viper-no-multiple-ESC is 'twice double ESC would ding in vi-state.<br/>Other ESC sequences are emulated via the current Emacs's major mode<br/>keymap.  This is more convenient on TTYs, since this won't block<br/>function keys such as up, down, etc.  ESC will also will also work as<br/>a Meta key in this case.  When viper-no-multiple-ESC is nil, ESC works<br/>as a Meta key and any number of multiple escapes are allowed.
