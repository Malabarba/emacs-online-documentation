(viper-ESC <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Emulate ESC key in Emacs.</br>
Prevents multiple escape keystrokes if viper-no-multiple-ESC is true.</br>
If viper-no-multiple-ESC is 'twice double ESC would ding in vi-state.</br>
Other ESC sequences are emulated via the current Emacs's major mode</br>
keymap.  This is more convenient on TTYs, since this won't block</br>
function keys such as up, down, etc.  ESC will also will also work as</br>
a Meta key in this case.  When viper-no-multiple-ESC is nil, ESC works</br>
as a Meta key and any number of multiple escapes are allowed.
