<strong>viper-del-backward-char-in-replace</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>viper-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(viper-del-backward-char-in-replace)</br>
</br>
Delete one character in replace mode.</br>
If `viper-delete-backwards-in-replace' is t, then DEL key actually deletes</br>
characters.  If it is nil, then the cursor just moves backwards, similarly</br>
to Vi.  The variable `viper-ex-style-editing', if t, doesn't let the</br>
cursor move past the beginning of line.
