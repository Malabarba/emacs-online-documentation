De-Viperize Emacs.<br/>
This function tries to do as good a job as possible.  However, it may undo some<br/>
user customization, unrelated to Viper.  For instance, if the user advised<br/>
`read-file-name', `describe-key', and some others, then this advice will be<br/>
undone.<br/>
It also can't undo some Viper settings.
