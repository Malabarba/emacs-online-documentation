viper-repeat-from-history is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `viper-cmd.el'.<br/><br/>(viper-repeat-from-history)<br/><br/>Repeat a destructive command from history.<br/>Doesn't change viper-command-ring in any way, so `.' will work as before<br/>executing this command.<br/>This command is supposed to be bound to a two-character Vi macro where<br/>the second character is a digit 0 to 9.  The digit indicates which<br/>history command to execute. `<char>0' is equivalent to `.', `<char>1'<br/>invokes the command before that, etc.
