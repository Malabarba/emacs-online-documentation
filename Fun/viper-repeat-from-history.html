<strong>viper-repeat-from-history</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>viper-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(viper-repeat-from-history)</br>
</br>
Repeat a destructive command from history.</br>
Doesn't change viper-command-ring in any way, so `.' will work as before</br>
executing this command.</br>
This command is supposed to be bound to a two-character Vi macro where</br>
the second character is a digit 0 to 9.  The digit indicates which</br>
history command to execute. `&lt;char>0' is equivalent to `.', `&lt;char>1'</br>
invokes the command before that, etc.
