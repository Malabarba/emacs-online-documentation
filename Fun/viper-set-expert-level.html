<strong>viper-set-expert-level</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>viper-cmd.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(viper-set-expert-level &optional DONT-CHANGE-UNLESS)<br/>
<br/>
Sets the expert level for a Viper user.<br/>
Can be called interactively to change (temporarily or permanently) the<br/>
current expert level.<br/>
<br/>
The optional argument DONT-CHANGE-UNLESS, if not nil, says that<br/>
the level should not be changed, unless its current value is<br/>
meaningless (i.e., not one of 1,2,3,4,5).<br/>
<br/>
User level determines the setting of Viper variables that are most<br/>
sensitive for VI-style look-and-feel.
