</br>
(viper-surrounding-word <u>COUNT</u> <u>CLICK-COUNT</u>)</br>
</br>
Returns word surrounding point according to a heuristic.</br>
<u>COUNT</u> indicates how many regions to return.</br>
If <u>CLICK-COUNT</u> is 1, `word' is a word in Vi sense.</br>
If <u>CLICK-COUNT</u> is 2,then `word' is a Word in Vi sense.</br>
If the character clicked on is a non-separator and is non-alphanumeric but</br>
is adjacent to an alphanumeric symbol, then it is considered alphanumeric</br>
for the purpose of this command.  If this character has a matching</br>
character, such as `(' is a match for `)', then the matching character is</br>
also considered alphanumeric.</br>
For convenience, in Lisp modes, `-' is considered alphanumeric.</br>
</br>
If <u>CLICK-COUNT</u> is 3 or more, returns the line clicked on with leading and</br>
trailing space and tabs removed.  In that case, the first argument, <u>COUNT</u>,</br>
is ignored.
