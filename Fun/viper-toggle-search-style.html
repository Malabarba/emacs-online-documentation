<strong>viper-toggle-search-style</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>viper-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(viper-toggle-search-style <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle the value of viper-case-fold-search/viper-re-search.</br>
Without prefix argument, will ask which search style to toggle.  With prefix</br>
arg 1, toggles viper-case-fold-search; with arg 2 toggles viper-re-search.</br>
</br>
Although this function is bound to M-x viper-toggle-search-style, the most</br>
convenient way to use it is to bind `//' to the macro</br>
`1 M-x viper-toggle-search-style' and `///' to</br>
`2 M-x viper-toggle-search-style'.  In this way, hitting `//' quickly will</br>
toggle case-fold-search and hitting `/' three times with toggle regexp</br>
search.  Macros are more convenient in this case because they don't affect</br>
the Emacs binding of `/'.
