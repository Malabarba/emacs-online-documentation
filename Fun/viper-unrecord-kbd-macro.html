<strong>viper-unrecord-kbd-macro</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>viper-macs.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(viper-unrecord-kbd-macro MACRO-NAME STATE)<br/>
<br/>
Delete macro MACRO-NAME from Viper STATE.<br/>
MACRO-NAME must be a vector of viper-style keys.  This command is used by Viper<br/>
internally, but the user can also use it in ~/.viper to delete pre-defined<br/>
macros supplied with Viper.  The best way to avoid mistakes in macro names to<br/>
be passed to this function is to use viper-describe-kbd-macros and copy the<br/>
name from there.
