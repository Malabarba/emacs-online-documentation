<strong>viper-unrecord-kbd-macro</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>viper-macs.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(viper-unrecord-kbd-macro <u>MACRO-NAME</u> <u>STATE</u>)</br>
</br>
Delete macro <u>MACRO-NAME</u> from Viper <u>STATE</u>.</br>
<u>MACRO-NAME</u> must be a vector of viper-style keys.  This command is used</br>
by Viper internally, but you can also use it in `viper-custom-file-name'</br>
to delete pre-defined macros supplied with Viper.  The best way to avoid</br>
mistakes in macro names to be passed to this function is to use</br>
`viper-describe-kbd-macros' and copy the name from there.
