<strong>visit-tags-table</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>etags.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to <menu-bar> <edit> <goto> <set-tags-name>.<br/>
<br/>
(visit-tags-table FILE &optional LOCAL)<br/>
<br/>
Tell tags commands to use tags table file FILE.<br/>
FILE should be the name of a file created with the `etags' program.<br/>
A directory name is ok too; it means file TAGS in that directory.<br/>
<br/>
Normally M-x visit-tags-table sets the global value of `tags-file-name'.<br/>
With a prefix arg, set the buffer-local value instead.<br/>
When you find a tag with M-., the buffer it finds the tag<br/>
in is given a local value of this variable which is the name of the tags<br/>
file the tag was in.
