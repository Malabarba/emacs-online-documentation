walk-window-subtree is a compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(walk-window-subtree FUN &optional WINDOW ANY)<br/><br/>Run function FUN on the subtree of windows rooted at WINDOW.<br/>WINDOW defaults to the selected window.  FUN must be a function<br/>with one argument - a window.  By default, run FUN only on live<br/>windows of the subtree.  If the optional argument ANY is non-nil,<br/>run FUN on all live and internal windows of the subtree.  If<br/>WINDOW is live, run FUN on WINDOW only.<br/><br/>This function performs a pre-order, depth-first traversal of the<br/>subtree rooted at WINDOW.  If FUN changes that tree, the result<br/>is unpredictable.
