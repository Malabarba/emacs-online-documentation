<strong>walk-windows</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(walk-windows FUN &optional MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES)<br/>
<br/>
Cycle through all live windows, calling FUN for each one.<br/>
FUN must specify a function with a window as its sole argument.<br/>
The optional arguments MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES specify the set of<br/>
windows to include in the walk.<br/>
<br/>
MINIBUF t means include the minibuffer window even if the<br/>
minibuffer is not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means include<br/>
the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any<br/>
other value means do not include the minibuffer window even if<br/>
the minibuffer is active.<br/>
<br/>
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows on the<br/>
selected frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the<br/>
MINIBUF argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows<br/>
on all frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following<br/>
non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:<br/>
<br/>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.<br/>
<br/>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on<br/>
  the current terminal.<br/>
<br/>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible<br/>
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.<br/>
<br/>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame<br/>
and no others.<br/>
<br/>
This function changes neither the order of recently selected<br/>
windows nor the buffer list.
