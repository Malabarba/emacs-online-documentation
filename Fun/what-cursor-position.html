<code>(what-cursor-position <em>&optional</em> <u>DETAIL</u></code>)</br>
</br>
Print info on cursor position (on screen and within buffer).</br>
Also describe the character after point, and give its character code</br>
in octal, decimal and hex.</br>

For a non-ASCII multibyte character, also give its encoding in the</br>
buffer's selected coding system if the coding system encodes the</br>
character safely.  If the character is encoded into one byte, that</br>
code is shown in hex.  If the character is encoded into more than one</br>
byte, just "..." is shown.</br>

In addition, with prefix argument, show details about that character</br>
