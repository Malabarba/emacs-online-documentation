<strong>windmove-constrain-loc-for-movement</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>windmove.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(windmove-constrain-loc-for-movement <u>COORD</u> <u>WINDOW</u> <u>DIR</u>)</br>
</br>
Constrain <u>COORD</u> so that it is reasonable for the given movement.</br>
This involves two things: first, make sure that the "off" coordinate</br>
-- the one not being moved on, e.g., y for horizontal movement -- is</br>
within frame boundaries; second, if the movement is down and we're not</br>
moving from the minibuffer, make sure that the y coordinate does not</br>
exceed the frame max-y, so that we don't overshoot the minibuffer</br>
accidentally.  <u>WINDOW</u> is the window that movement is relative to; <u>DIR</u></br>
is the direction of the movement, one of `left', `up', `right',</br>
or `down'.</br>
Returns the constrained coordinate.
