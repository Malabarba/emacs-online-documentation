windmove-constrain-loc-for-movement is a compiled Lisp function in `windmove.el'.<br/><br/>(windmove-constrain-loc-for-movement COORD WINDOW DIR)<br/><br/>Constrain COORD so that it is reasonable for the given movement.<br/>This involves two things: first, make sure that the "off" coordinate<br/>-- the one not being moved on, e.g., y for horizontal movement -- is<br/>within frame boundaries; second, if the movement is down and we're not<br/>moving from the minibuffer, make sure that the y coordinate does not<br/>exceed the frame max-y, so that we don't overshoot the minibuffer<br/>accidentally.  WINDOW is the window that movement is relative to; DIR<br/>is the direction of the movement, one of `left', `up', `right',<br/>or `down'.<br/>Returns the constrained coordinate.
