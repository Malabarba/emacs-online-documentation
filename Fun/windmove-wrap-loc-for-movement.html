<strong>windmove-wrap-loc-for-movement</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>windmove.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(windmove-wrap-loc-for-movement COORD WINDOW)<br/>
<br/>
Takes the constrained COORD and wraps it around for the movement.<br/>
This makes an out-of-range x or y coordinate and wraps it around the<br/>
frame, giving a coordinate (hopefully) in the window on the other edge<br/>
of the frame.  WINDOW is the window that movement is relative to (nil<br/>
means the currently selected window).  Returns the wrapped coordinate.
