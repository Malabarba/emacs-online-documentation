</br>
(windmove-wrap-loc-for-movement <u>COORD</u> <u>WINDOW</u>)</br>
</br>
Takes the constrained <u>COORD</u> and wraps it around for the movement.</br>
This makes an out-of-range x or y coordinate and wraps it around the</br>
frame, giving a coordinate (hopefully) in the window on the other edge</br>
of the frame.  <u>WINDOW</u> is the window that movement is relative to (nil</br>
means the currently selected window).  Returns the wrapped coordinate.
