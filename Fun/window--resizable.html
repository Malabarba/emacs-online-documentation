<strong>window--resizable</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window--resizable WINDOW DELTA &optional HORIZONTAL IGNORE TRAIL NOUP NODOWN)<br/>
<br/>
Return DELTA if WINDOW can be resized vertically by DELTA lines.<br/>
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return DELTA if WINDOW<br/>
can be resized horizontally by DELTA columns.  A return value of<br/>
zero means that WINDOW is not resizable.<br/>
<br/>
DELTA positive means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA lines or<br/>
columns.  If WINDOW cannot be enlarged by DELTA lines or columns,<br/>
return the maximum value in the range 0..DELTA by which WINDOW<br/>
can be enlarged.<br/>
<br/>
DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA lines or<br/>
columns.  If WINDOW cannot be shrunk by -DELTA lines or columns,<br/>
return the minimum value in the range DELTA..0 that can be used<br/>
for shrinking WINDOW.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions<br/>
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or<br/>
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore<br/>
restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',<br/>
live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines<br/>
and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value<br/>
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument TRAIL `before' means only windows to the left<br/>
of or below WINDOW can be shrunk.  Optional argument TRAIL<br/>
`after' means only windows to the right of or above WINDOW can be<br/>
shrunk.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument NOUP non-nil means don't go up in the window<br/>
tree but check only whether space can be obtained from (or given<br/>
to) WINDOW's siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument NODOWN non-nil means don't go down in the<br/>
window tree.  This means do not check whether resizing would<br/>
violate size restrictions of WINDOW or its child windows.
