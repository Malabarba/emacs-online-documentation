<strong>window--resize-root-window-vertically</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window--resize-root-window-vertically WINDOW DELTA)<br/>
<br/>
Resize root window WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.<br/>
If DELTA is less than zero and we can't shrink WINDOW by DELTA<br/>
lines, shrink it as much as possible.  If DELTA is greater than<br/>
zero, this function can resize fixed-size windows in order to<br/>
recover the necessary lines.<br/>
<br/>
Return the number of lines that were recovered.<br/>
<br/>
This function is only called by the minibuffer window resizing<br/>
routines.  It resizes windows proportionally and never deletes<br/>
any windows.
