</br>
(window--sanitize-window-sizes <u>FRAME</u> <u>HORIZONTAL</u>)</br>
</br>
Assert that all windows on <u>FRAME</u> are large enough.</br>
If necessary and possible, make sure that every window on frame</br>
<u>FRAME</u> has its minimum height.  Optional argument <u>HORIZONTAL</u></br>
non-nil means to make sure that every window on frame <u>FRAME</u> has</br>
its minimum width.  The minimum height/width of a window is the</br>
respective value returned by `window-min-size' for that window.</br>
</br>
Return t if all windows were resized appropriately.  Return nil</br>
if at least one window could not be resized as requested, which</br>
may happen when the <u>FRAME</u> is not large enough to accommodate it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
