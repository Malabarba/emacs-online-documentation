(window--sanitize-window-sizes <u>FRAME</u> <u>HORIZONTAL</u>)</br>
</br>

If necessary and possible, make sure that every window on frame</br>
<u>FRAME</u> has its minimum height.  Optional argument <u>HORIZONTAL</u></br>
non-nil means to make sure that every window on frame <u>FRAME</u> has</br>
its minimum width.  The minimum height/width of a window is the</br>
respective value returned by `window-min-size' for that window.</br>

if at least one window could not be resized as requested, which</br>
may happen when the <u>FRAME</u> is not large enough to accommodate it.
