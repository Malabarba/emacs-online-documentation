More precisely, return the value assigned by the last call of</br>
`set-window-dedicated-p' for <u>WINDOW</u>.  Return nil if that function was</br>
never called with <u>WINDOW</u> as its argument, or the value set by that</br>
function was internally reset since its last call.  <u>WINDOW</u> must be a</br>
live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>

When a window is dedicated to its buffer, `display-buffer' will refrain</br>
from displaying another buffer in it.  `get-lru-window' and</br>
`get-largest-window' treat dedicated windows specially.</br>
`delete-windows-on', `replace-buffer-in-windows', `quit-window' and</br>
`kill-buffer' can delete a dedicated window and the containing frame.</br>
</br>
Functions like `set-window-buffer' may change the buffer displayed by a</br>
window, unless that window is "strongly" dedicated to its buffer, that</br>
