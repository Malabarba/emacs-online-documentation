window-dot is an alias for `window-point' in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(window-dot &optional WINDOW)<br/><br/>This function is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>use `window-point' instead.<br/><br/>Return current value of point in WINDOW.<br/>WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/><br/>For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have if that<br/>window were selected.<br/><br/>Note that, when WINDOW is selected, the value returned is the same as<br/>that returned by `point' for WINDOW's buffer.  It would be more strictly<br/>correct to return the `top-level' value of `point', outside of any<br/>`save-excursion' forms.  But that is hard to define.
