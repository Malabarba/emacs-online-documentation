</br>
(window-dot &optional <u>WINDOW</u>)</br>
</br>
This function is obsolete since 22.1;</br>
use `window-point' instead.</br>
</br>
Return current value of point in <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
</br>
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have if that</br>
window were selected.</br>
</br>
Note that, when <u>WINDOW</u> is selected, the value returned is the same as</br>
that returned by `point' for <u>WINDOW</u>'s buffer.  It would be more strictly</br>
correct to return the top-level value of `point', outside of any</br>
`save-excursion' forms.  But that is hard to define.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
