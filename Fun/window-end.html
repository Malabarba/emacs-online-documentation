<strong>window-end</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window-end &optional WINDOW UPDATE)<br/>
<br/>
Return position at which display currently ends in WINDOW.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
This is updated by redisplay, when it runs to completion.<br/>
Simply changing the buffer text or setting `window-start'<br/>
does not update this value.<br/>
Return nil if there is no recorded value.  (This can happen if the<br/>
last redisplay of WINDOW was preempted, and did not finish.)<br/>
If UPDATE is non-nil, compute the up-to-date position<br/>
if it isn't already recorded.
