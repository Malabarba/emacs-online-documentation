<strong>window-end</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(window-end &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>UPDATE</u>)</br>
</br>
Return position at which display currently ends in <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
This is updated by redisplay, when it runs to completion.</br>
Simply changing the buffer text or setting `window-start'</br>
does not update this value.</br>
Return nil if there is no recorded value.  (This can happen if the</br>
last redisplay of <u>WINDOW</u> was preempted, and did not finish.)</br>
If <u>UPDATE</u> is non-nil, compute the up-to-date position</br>
if it isn't already recorded.
