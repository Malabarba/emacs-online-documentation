<strong>window-height</strong> is an alias for `<strong><a href="/Fun/window-total-height.html">window-total-height</a></strong>' in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(window-height &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>ROUND</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the height of window <u>WINDOW</u> in lines.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
</br>
The return value includes the heights of <u>WINDOW</u>'s mode and header line</br>
and its bottom divider, if any.  If <u>WINDOW</u> is an internal window, the</br>
total height is the height of the screen areas spanned by its children.</br>
</br>
If <u>WINDOW</u>'s pixel height is not an integral multiple of its frame's</br>
character height, the number of lines occupied by <u>WINDOW</u> is rounded</br>
internally.  This is done in a way such that, if <u>WINDOW</u> is a parent</br>
window, the sum of the total heights of all its children internally</br>
equals the total height of <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>ROUND</u> is `ceiling', return the smallest integer</br>
larger than <u>WINDOW</u>'s pixel height divided by the character height of</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>'s frame.  <u>ROUND</u> `floor' means to return the largest integer</br>
smaller than <u>WINDOW</u>'s pixel height divided by the character height of</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>'s frame.  Any other value of <u>ROUND</u> means to return the internal</br>
total height of <u>WINDOW</u>.
