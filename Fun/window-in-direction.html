<strong>window-in-direction</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window-in-direction DIRECTION &optional WINDOW IGNORE)<br/>
<br/>
Return window in DIRECTION as seen from WINDOW.<br/>
More precisely, return the nearest window in direction DIRECTION<br/>
as seen from the position of `window-point' in window WINDOW.<br/>
DIRECTION must be one of `above', `below', `left' or `right'.<br/>
WINDOW must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
<br/>
Do not return a window whose `no-other-window' parameter is<br/>
non-nil.  If the nearest window's `no-other-window' parameter is<br/>
non-nil, try to find another window in the indicated direction.<br/>
If, however, the optional argument IGNORE is non-nil, return that<br/>
window even if its `no-other-window' parameter is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
Return nil if no suitable window can be found.
