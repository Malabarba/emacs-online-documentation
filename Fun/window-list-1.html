<strong>window-list-1</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window-list-1 &optional WINDOW MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES)<br/>
<br/>
Return a list of all live windows.<br/>
WINDOW specifies the first window to list and defaults to the selected<br/>
window.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument MINIBUF nil or omitted means consider the minibuffer<br/>
window only if the minibuffer is active.  MINIBUF t means consider the<br/>
minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is not active.  Any other value<br/>
means do not consider the minibuffer window even if the minibuffer is<br/>
active.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means consider all windows<br/>
on WINDOW's frame, plus the minibuffer window if specified by the<br/>
MINIBUF argument.  If the minibuffer counts, consider all windows on all<br/>
frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following non-nil values of<br/>
ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:<br/>
<br/>
- t means consider all windows on all existing frames.<br/>
<br/>
- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames.<br/>
<br/>
- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and<br/>
  iconified frames.<br/>
<br/>
- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else means consider all windows on WINDOW's frame and no<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
If WINDOW is not on the list of windows returned, some other window will<br/>
be listed first but no error is signaled.
