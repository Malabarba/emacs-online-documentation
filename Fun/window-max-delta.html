window-max-delta is a compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(window-max-delta &optional WINDOW HORIZONTAL IGNORE TRAIL NOUP NODOWN)<br/><br/>Return maximum number of lines by which WINDOW can be enlarged.<br/>WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>The return value is zero if WINDOW cannot be enlarged.<br/><br/>Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return maximum number<br/>of columns by which WINDOW can be enlarged.<br/><br/>Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions<br/>imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or<br/>`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore<br/>restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',<br/>live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines<br/>and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value means<br/>ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<br/><br/>Optional argument TRAIL restricts the windows that can be enlarged.<br/>If its value is `before', only windows to the left of or above WINDOW<br/>can be enlarged.  If it is `after', only windows to the right of or<br/>below WINDOW can be enlarged.<br/><br/>Optional argument NOUP non-nil means don't go up in the window<br/>tree but try to obtain the entire space from windows within<br/>WINDOW's combination.<br/><br/>Optional argument NODOWN non-nil means do not check whether<br/>WINDOW itself (and its child windows) can be enlarged; check<br/>only whether other windows can be shrunk appropriately.
