<strong>window-min-delta</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window-min-delta &optional WINDOW HORIZONTAL IGNORE TRAIL NOUP NODOWN)<br/>
<br/>
Return number of lines by which WINDOW can be shrunk.<br/>
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>
Return zero if WINDOW cannot be shrunk.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return number of<br/>
columns by which WINDOW can be shrunk.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions<br/>
imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or<br/>
`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore<br/>
restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',<br/>
live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines<br/>
and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value<br/>
means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument TRAIL restricts the windows that can be enlarged.<br/>
If its value is `before', only windows to the left of or above WINDOW<br/>
can be enlarged.  If it is `after', only windows to the right of or<br/>
below WINDOW can be enlarged.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument NOUP non-nil means don't go up in the window<br/>
tree, but try to enlarge windows within WINDOW's combination only.<br/>
<br/>
Optional argument NODOWN non-nil means don't check whether WINDOW<br/>
itself (and its child windows) can be shrunk; check only whether<br/>
at least one other window can be enlarged appropriately.
