<strong>window-normal-size</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(window-normal-size &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>HORIZONTAL</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the normal height of window <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
If <u>HORIZONTAL</u> is non-nil, return the normal width of <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
</br>
The normal height of a frame's root window or a window that is</br>
horizontally combined (a window that has a left or right sibling) is</br>
1.0.  The normal height of a window that is vertically combined (has a</br>
sibling above or below) is the fraction of the window's height with</br>
respect to its parent.  The sum of the normal heights of all windows in a</br>
vertical combination equals 1.0.</br>
</br>
Similarly, the normal width of a frame's root window or a window that is</br>
vertically combined equals 1.0.  The normal width of a window that is</br>
horizontally combined is the fraction of the window's width with respect</br>
to its parent.  The sum of the normal widths of all windows in a</br>
horizontal combination equals 1.0.</br>
</br>
The normal sizes of windows are used to restore the proportional sizes</br>
of windows after they have been shrunk to their minimum sizes; for</br>
example when a frame is temporarily made very small and afterwards gets</br>
re-enlarged to its previous size.
