window-resizable is a compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(window-resizable WINDOW DELTA &optional HORIZONTAL IGNORE)<br/><br/>Return DELTA if WINDOW can be resized vertically by DELTA lines.<br/>WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return DELTA if WINDOW<br/>can be resized horizontally by DELTA columns.  A return value of<br/>zero means that WINDOW is not resizable.<br/><br/>DELTA positive means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA lines or<br/>columns.  If WINDOW cannot be enlarged by DELTA lines or columns<br/>return the maximum value in the range 0..DELTA by which WINDOW<br/>can be enlarged.<br/><br/>DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA lines or<br/>columns.  If WINDOW cannot be shrunk by -DELTA lines or columns,<br/>return the minimum value in the range DELTA..0 that can be used<br/>for shrinking WINDOW.<br/><br/>Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions<br/>imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or<br/>`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore<br/>restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',<br/>live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines<br/>and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value<br/>means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.
