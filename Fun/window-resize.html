window-resize is a compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(window-resize WINDOW DELTA &optional HORIZONTAL IGNORE)<br/><br/>Resize WINDOW vertically by DELTA lines.<br/>WINDOW can be an arbitrary window and defaults to the selected<br/>one.  An attempt to resize the root window of a frame will raise<br/>an error though.<br/><br/>DELTA a positive number means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA<br/>lines.  DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA<br/>lines.<br/><br/>Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means resize WINDOW<br/>horizontally by DELTA columns.  In this case a positive DELTA<br/>means enlarge WINDOW by DELTA columns.  DELTA negative means<br/>WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA columns.<br/><br/>Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions<br/>imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or<br/>`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore<br/>restrictions for that window only.  If IGNORE equals `safe',<br/>live windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines<br/>and `window-safe-min-width' columns.  Any other non-nil value<br/>means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.<br/><br/>This function resizes other windows proportionally and never<br/>deletes any windows.  If you want to move only the low (right)<br/>edge of WINDOW consider using `adjust-window-trailing-edge'<br/>instead.
