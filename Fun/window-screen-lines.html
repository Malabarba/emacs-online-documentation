<strong>window-screen-lines</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(window-screen-lines)</br>
</br>
Return the number of screen lines in the text area of the selected window.</br>
</br>
This is different from `window-text-height' in that this function counts</br>
lines in units of the height of the font used by the default face displayed</br>
in the window, not in units of the frame's default font, and also accounts</br>
for `line-spacing', if any, defined for the window's buffer or frame.</br>
</br>
The value is a floating-point number.
