window-sizable is a compiled Lisp function in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(window-sizable WINDOW DELTA &optional HORIZONTAL IGNORE)<br/><br/>Return DELTA if DELTA lines can be added to WINDOW.<br/>WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.<br/>Optional argument HORIZONTAL non-nil means return DELTA if DELTA<br/>columns can be added to WINDOW.  A return value of zero means<br/>that no lines (or columns) can be added to WINDOW.<br/><br/>This function looks only at WINDOW and, recursively, its child<br/>windows.  The function `window-resizable' looks at other windows<br/>as well.<br/><br/>DELTA positive means WINDOW shall be enlarged by DELTA lines or<br/>columns.  If WINDOW cannot be enlarged by DELTA lines or columns<br/>return the maximum value in the range 0..DELTA by which WINDOW<br/>can be enlarged.<br/><br/>DELTA negative means WINDOW shall be shrunk by -DELTA lines or<br/>columns.  If WINDOW cannot be shrunk by -DELTA lines or columns,<br/>return the minimum value in the range DELTA..0 by which WINDOW<br/>can be shrunk.<br/><br/>Optional argument IGNORE non-nil means ignore restrictions<br/>imposed by fixed size windows, `window-min-height' or<br/>`window-min-width' settings.  If IGNORE equals `safe', live<br/>windows may get as small as `window-safe-min-height' lines and<br/>`window-safe-min-width' columns.  If IGNORE is a window, ignore<br/>restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-nil value means<br/>ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.
