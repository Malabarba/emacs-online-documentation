<strong>window-splittable-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window-splittable-p WINDOW &optional HORIZONTAL)<br/>
<br/>
Return non-nil if `split-window-sensibly' may split WINDOW.<br/>
Optional argument HORIZONTAL nil or omitted means check whether<br/>
`split-window-sensibly' may split WINDOW vertically.  HORIZONTAL<br/>
non-nil means check whether WINDOW may be split horizontally.<br/>
<br/>
WINDOW may be split vertically when the following conditions<br/>
hold:<br/>
- `window-size-fixed' is either nil or equals `width' for the<br/>
  buffer of WINDOW.<br/>
- `split-height-threshold' is an integer and WINDOW is at least as<br/>
  high as `split-height-threshold'.<br/>
- When WINDOW is split evenly, the emanating windows are at least<br/>
  `window-min-height' lines tall and can accommodate at least one<br/>
  line plus - if WINDOW has one - a mode line.<br/>
<br/>
WINDOW may be split horizontally when the following conditions<br/>
hold:<br/>
- `window-size-fixed' is either nil or equals `height' for the<br/>
  buffer of WINDOW.<br/>
- `split-width-threshold' is an integer and WINDOW is at least as<br/>
  wide as `split-width-threshold'.<br/>
- When WINDOW is split evenly, the emanating windows are at least<br/>
  `window-min-width' or two (whichever is larger) columns wide.
