<strong>window-total-width</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(window-total-width &optional <u>WINDOW</u> <u>ROUND</u>)</br>
</br>
Return the total width of window <u>WINDOW</u> in columns.</br>
<u>WINDOW</u> must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.</br>
</br>
The return value includes the widths of <u>WINDOW</u>'s fringes, margins,</br>
scroll bars and its right divider, if any.  If <u>WINDOW</u> is an internal</br>
window, the total width is the width of the screen areas spanned by its</br>
children.</br>
</br>
If <u>WINDOW</u>'s pixel width is not an integral multiple of its frame's</br>
character width, the number of lines occupied by <u>WINDOW</u> is rounded</br>
internally.  This is done in a way such that, if <u>WINDOW</u> is a parent</br>
window, the sum of the total widths of all its children internally</br>
equals the total width of <u>WINDOW</u>.</br>
</br>
If the optional argument <u>ROUND</u> is `ceiling', return the smallest integer</br>
larger than <u>WINDOW</u>'s pixel width divided by the character width of</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>'s frame.  <u>ROUND</u> `floor' means to return the largest integer</br>
smaller than <u>WINDOW</u>'s pixel width divided by the character width of</br>
<u>WINDOW</u>'s frame.  Any other value of <u>ROUND</u> means to return the internal</br>
total width of <u>WINDOW</u>.
