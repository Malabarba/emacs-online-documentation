<strong>window-tree</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(window-tree &optional FRAME)<br/>
<br/>
Return the window tree of frame FRAME.<br/>
FRAME must be a live frame and defaults to the selected frame.<br/>
The return value is a list of the form (ROOT MINI), where ROOT<br/>
represents the window tree of the frame's root window, and MINI<br/>
is the frame's minibuffer window.<br/>
<br/>
If the root window is not split, ROOT is the root window itself.<br/>
Otherwise, ROOT is a list (DIR EDGES W1 W2 ...) where DIR is nil<br/>
for a horizontal split, and t for a vertical split.  EDGES gives<br/>
the combined size and position of the child windows in the split,<br/>
and the rest of the elements are the child windows in the split.<br/>
Each of the child windows may again be a window or a list<br/>
representing a window split, and so on.  EDGES is a list (LEFT<br/>
TOP RIGHT BOTTOM) as returned by `window-edges'.
