<strong>with-decoded-time-value</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>time-date.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-decoded-time-value VARLIST &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Decode a time value and bind it according to VARLIST, then eval BODY.<br/>
<br/>
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.<br/>
<br/>
Each element of the list VARLIST is a list of the form<br/>
(HIGH-SYMBOL LOW-SYMBOL MICRO-SYMBOL [PICO-SYMBOL [TYPE-SYMBOL]] TIME-VALUE).<br/>
The time value TIME-VALUE is decoded and the result it bound to<br/>
the symbols HIGH-SYMBOL, LOW-SYMBOL and MICRO-SYMBOL.<br/>
The optional PICO-SYMBOL is bound to the picoseconds part.<br/>
<br/>
The optional TYPE-SYMBOL is bound to the type of the time value.<br/>
Type 0 is the cons cell (HIGH . LOW), type 1 is the list (HIGH<br/>
LOW), type 2 is the list (HIGH LOW MICRO), and type 3 is the<br/>
list (HIGH LOW MICRO PICO).
