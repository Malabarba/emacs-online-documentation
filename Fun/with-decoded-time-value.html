Each element of the list <u>VARLIST</u> is a list of the form</br>
(HIGH-SYMBOL LOW-SYMBOL MICRO-SYMBOL [PICO-SYMBOL [TYPE-SYMBOL]] TIME-VALUE).</br>
The time value TIME-VALUE is decoded and the result is bound to</br>
the symbols HIGH-SYMBOL, LOW-SYMBOL and MICRO-SYMBOL.</br>
The optional PICO-SYMBOL is bound to the picoseconds part.</br>
</br>
The optional TYPE-SYMBOL is bound to the type of the time value.</br>
Type 0 is the cons cell (HIGH . LOW), type 1 is the list (HIGH</br>
