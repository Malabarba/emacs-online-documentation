<strong>with-demoted-errors</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-demoted-errors &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Run BODY and demote any errors to simple messages.<br/>
If `debug-on-error' is non-nil, run BODY without catching its errors.<br/>
This is to be used around code which is not expected to signal an error<br/>
but which should be robust in the unexpected case that an error is signaled.
