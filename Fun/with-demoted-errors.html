<strong>with-demoted-errors</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(with-demoted-errors <u>FORMAT</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Run <u>BODY</u> and demote any errors to simple messages.</br>
<u>FORMAT</u> is a string passed to `message' to format any error message.</br>
It should contain a single %-sequence; e.g., "Error: %S".</br>
</br>
If `debug-on-error' is non-nil, run <u>BODY</u> without catching its errors.</br>
This is to be used around code which is not expected to signal an error</br>
but which should be robust in the unexpected case that an error is signaled.</br>
</br>
For backward compatibility, if <u>FORMAT</u> is not a constant string, it</br>
is assumed to be part of <u>BODY</u>, in which case the message format</br>
used is "Error: %S".
