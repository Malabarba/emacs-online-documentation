<strong>with-electric-help</strong> is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>ehelp.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-electric-help THUNK &optional BUFFER NOERASE MINHEIGHT)<br/>
<br/>
Pop up an "electric" help buffer.<br/>
THUNK is a function of no arguments which is called to initialize the<br/>
contents of BUFFER.  BUFFER defaults to `*Help*'.  BUFFER will be<br/>
erased before THUNK is called unless NOERASE is non-nil.  THUNK will<br/>
be called while BUFFER is current and with `standard-output' bound to<br/>
the buffer specified by BUFFER.<br/>
<br/>
If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and shrink<br/>
the window to fit.  If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.<br/>
<br/>
After THUNK has been called, this function "electrically" pops up a<br/>
window in which BUFFER is displayed and allows the user to scroll<br/>
through that buffer in `electric-help-mode'.  The window's height will<br/>
be at least MINHEIGHT if this value is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and<br/>
shrink the window to fit if `electric-help-shrink-window' is non-nil.<br/>
If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.<br/>
<br/>
When the user exits (with `electric-help-exit', or otherwise), the help<br/>
buffer's window disappears (i.e., we use `save-window-excursion'), and<br/>
BUFFER is put back into its original major mode.
