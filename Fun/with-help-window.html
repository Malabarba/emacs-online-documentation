</br>
(with-help-window <u>BUFFER-NAME</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Display buffer named <u>BUFFER-NAME</u> in a help window.</br>
Evaluate the forms in <u>BODY</u> with standard output bound to a buffer</br>
called <u>BUFFER-NAME</u> (creating it if it does not exist), put that</br>
buffer in `help-mode', display the buffer in a window (see</br>
`with-temp-buffer-window' for details) and issue a message how to</br>
deal with that "help" window when it's no more needed.  Select</br>
the help window if the current value of the user option</br>
`help-window-select' says so.  Return last value in <u>BODY</u>.
