</br>
Display buffer with name <u>BUFFER-NAME</u> in a help window.</br>
Evaluate the forms in <u>BODY</u> with the buffer specified by</br>
<u>BUFFER-NAME</u> current, put that buffer in `help-mode', display the</br>
buffer in a window (see `with-temp-buffer-window' for details)</br>
and issue a message how to deal with that "help" window when</br>
it's no more needed.  Select the help window if the current value</br>
of the user option `help-window-select' says so.  Return last</br>
value in <u>BODY</u>.
