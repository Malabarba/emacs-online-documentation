<strong>with-local-quit</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-local-quit &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Execute BODY, allowing quits to terminate BODY but not escape further.<br/>
When a quit terminates BODY, `with-local-quit' returns nil but<br/>
requests another quit.  That quit will be processed as soon as quitting<br/>
is allowed once again.  (Immediately, if `inhibit-quit' is nil.)
