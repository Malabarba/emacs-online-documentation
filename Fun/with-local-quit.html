<strong>with-local-quit</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(with-local-quit &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute <u>BODY</u>, allowing quits to terminate <u>BODY</u> but not escape further.</br>
When a quit terminates <u>BODY</u>, `with-local-quit' returns nil but</br>
requests another quit.  That quit will be processed as soon as quitting</br>
is allowed once again.  (Immediately, if `inhibit-quit' is nil.)
