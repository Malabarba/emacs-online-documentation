<strong>with-mode-local-symbol</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>mode-local.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-mode-local-symbol MODE &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
With the local bindings of MODE symbol, evaluate BODY.<br/>
The current mode bindings are saved, BODY is evaluated, and the saved<br/>
bindings are restored, even in case of an abnormal exit.<br/>
Value is what BODY returns.<br/>
This is like `with-mode-local', except that MODE's value is used.<br/>
To use the symbol MODE (quoted), use `with-mode-local'.
