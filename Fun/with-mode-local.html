<strong>with-mode-local</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>mode-local.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-mode-local MODE &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
With the local bindings of MODE, evaluate BODY.<br/>
The current mode bindings are saved, BODY is evaluated, and the saved<br/>
bindings are restored, even in case of an abnormal exit.<br/>
Value is what BODY returns.<br/>
This is like `with-mode-local-symbol', except that MODE is quoted<br/>
and is not evaluated.
