<strong>with-mode-local</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>mode-local.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(with-mode-local <u>MODE</u> &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
With the local bindings of <u>MODE</u>, evaluate <u>BODY</u>.</br>
The current mode bindings are saved, <u>BODY</u> is evaluated, and the saved</br>
bindings are restored, even in case of an abnormal exit.</br>
Value is what <u>BODY</u> returns.</br>
This is like `with-mode-local-symbol', except that <u>MODE</u> is quoted</br>
and is not evaluated.
