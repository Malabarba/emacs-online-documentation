with-parsed-tramp-file-name is a Lisp macro in `tramp.el'.<br/><br/>(with-parsed-tramp-file-name FILENAME VAR &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Parse a Tramp filename and make components available in the body.<br/><br/>First arg FILENAME is evaluated and dissected into its components.<br/>Second arg VAR is a symbol.  It is used as a variable name to hold<br/>the filename structure.  It is also used as a prefix for the variables<br/>holding the components.  For example, if VAR is the symbol `foo', then<br/>`foo' will be bound to the whole structure, `foo-method' will be bound to<br/>the method component, and so on for `foo-user', `foo-host', `foo-localname',<br/>`foo-hop'.<br/><br/>Remaining args are Lisp expressions to be evaluated (inside an implicit<br/>`progn').<br/><br/>If VAR is nil, then we bind `v' to the structure and `method', `user',<br/>`host', `localname', `hop' to the components.
