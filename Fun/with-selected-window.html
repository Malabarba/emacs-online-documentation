<strong>with-selected-window</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-selected-window WINDOW &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Execute the forms in BODY with WINDOW as the selected window.<br/>
The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.<br/>
<br/>
This macro saves and restores the selected window, as well as the<br/>
selected window of each frame.  It does not change the order of<br/>
recently selected windows.  If the previously selected window of<br/>
some frame is no longer live at the end of BODY, that frame's<br/>
selected window is left alone.  If the selected window is no<br/>
longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of BODY<br/>
remains selected.<br/>
<br/>
This macro uses `save-current-buffer' to save and restore the<br/>
current buffer, since otherwise its normal operation could<br/>
potentially make a different buffer current.  It does not alter<br/>
the buffer list ordering.
