<strong>with-silent-modifications</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>subr.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(with-silent-modifications &rest <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Execute <u>BODY</u>, pretending it does not modify the buffer.</br>
If <u>BODY</u> performs real modifications to the buffer's text, other</br>
than cosmetic ones, undo data may become corrupted.</br>
</br>
This macro will run <u>BODY</u> normally, but doesn't count its buffer</br>
modifications as being buffer modifications.  This affects things</br>
like `buffer-modified-p', checking whether the file is locked by</br>
someone else, running buffer modification hooks, and other things</br>
of that nature.</br>
</br>
Typically used around modifications of text-properties which do</br>
not really affect the buffer's content.
