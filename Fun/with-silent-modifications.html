with-silent-modifications is a Lisp macro in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(with-silent-modifications &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Execute BODY, pretending it does not modify the buffer.<br/>If BODY performs real modifications to the buffer's text, other<br/>than cosmetic ones, undo data may become corrupted.<br/><br/>This macro will run BODY normally, but doesn't count its buffer<br/>modifications as being buffer modifications.  This affects things<br/>like buffer-modified-p, checking whether the file is locked by<br/>someone else, running buffer modification hooks, and other things<br/>of that nature.<br/><br/>Typically used around modifications of text-properties which do<br/>not really affect the buffer's content.
