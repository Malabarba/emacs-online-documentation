<strong>with-slots</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>eieio.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-slots SPEC-LIST OBJECT &rest BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Bind SPEC-LIST lexically to slot values in OBJECT, and execute BODY.<br/>
This establishes a lexical environment for referring to the slots in<br/>
the instance named by the given slot-names as though they were<br/>
variables.  Within such a context the value of the slot can be<br/>
specified by using its slot name, as if it were a lexically bound<br/>
variable.  Both setf and setq can be used to set the value of the<br/>
slot.<br/>
<br/>
SPEC-LIST is of a form similar to `let'.  For example:<br/>
<br/>
  ((VAR1 SLOT1)<br/>
    SLOT2<br/>
    SLOTN<br/>
   (VARN+1 SLOTN+1))<br/>
<br/>
Where each VAR is the local variable given to the associated<br/>
SLOT.  A slot specified without a variable name is given a<br/>
variable name of the same name as the slot.
