with-temp-buffer-window is a Lisp macro in `window.el'.<br/><br/>(with-temp-buffer-window BUFFER-OR-NAME ACTION QUIT-FUNCTION &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Bind `standard-output' to BUFFER-OR-NAME, eval BODY, show the buffer.<br/>BUFFER-OR-NAME must specify either a live buffer, or the name of a<br/>buffer (if it does not exist, this macro creates it).<br/><br/>This construct makes buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME empty before running BODY.<br/>It does not make the buffer current for BODY.<br/>Instead it binds `standard-output' to that buffer, so that output<br/>generated with `prin1' and similar functions in BODY goes into<br/>the buffer.<br/><br/>At the end of BODY, this marks the specified buffer unmodified and<br/>read-only, and displays it in a window (but does not select it, or make<br/>the buffer current).  The display happens by calling `display-buffer'<br/>with the ACTION argument.  If `temp-buffer-resize-mode' is enabled,<br/>the relevant window shrinks automatically.<br/><br/>This returns the value returned by BODY, unless QUIT-FUNCTION specifies<br/>a function.  In that case, it runs the function with two arguments -<br/>the window showing the specified buffer and the value returned by<br/>BODY - and returns the value returned by that function.<br/><br/>If the buffer is displayed on a new frame, the window manager may<br/>decide to select that frame.  In that case, it's usually a good<br/>strategy if QUIT-FUNCTION selects the window showing the buffer<br/>before reading any value from the minibuffer; for example, when<br/>asking a `yes-or-no-p' question.<br/><br/>This runs the hook `temp-buffer-window-setup-hook' before BODY,<br/>with the specified buffer temporarily current.  It runs the<br/>hook `temp-buffer-window-show-hook' after displaying the buffer,<br/>with that buffer temporarily current, and the window that was used to<br/>display it temporarily selected.<br/><br/>This construct is similar to `with-output-to-temp-buffer', but<br/>runs different hooks.  In particular, it does not run<br/>`temp-buffer-setup-hook', which usually puts the buffer in Help mode.<br/>Also, it does not call `temp-buffer-show-function' (the ACTION<br/>argument replaces this).
