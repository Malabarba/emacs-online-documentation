<strong>with-timeout-suspend</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>timer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(with-timeout-suspend)</br>
</br>
Stop the clock for `with-timeout'.  Used by debuggers.</br>
The idea is that the time you spend in the debugger should not</br>
count against these timeouts.</br>
</br>
The value is a list that the debugger can pass to `with-timeout-unsuspend'</br>
when it exits, to make these timers start counting again.
