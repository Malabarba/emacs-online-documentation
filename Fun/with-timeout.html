<strong>with-timeout</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>timer.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-timeout (SECONDS TIMEOUT-FORMS...) BODY)<br/>
<br/>
Run BODY, but if it doesn't finish in SECONDS seconds, give up.<br/>
If we give up, we run the TIMEOUT-FORMS and return the value of the last one.<br/>
The timeout is checked whenever Emacs waits for some kind of external<br/>
event (such as keyboard input, input from subprocesses, or a certain time);<br/>
if the program loops without waiting in any way, the timeout will not<br/>
be detected.
