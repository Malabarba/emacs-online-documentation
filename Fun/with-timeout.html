<strong>with-timeout</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>timer.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(with-timeout (<u>SECONDS</u> <u>TIMEOUT-FORMS</u>...) <u>BODY</u>)</br>
</br>
Run <u>BODY</u>, but if it doesn't finish in <u>SECONDS</u> seconds, give up.</br>
If we give up, we run the <u>TIMEOUT-FORMS</u> and return the value of the last one.</br>
The timeout is checked whenever Emacs waits for some kind of external</br>
event (such as keyboard input, input from subprocesses, or a certain time);</br>
if the program loops without waiting in any way, the timeout will not</br>
be detected.
