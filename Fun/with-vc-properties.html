<strong>with-vc-properties</strong> is a Lisp macro in `<code>vc.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(with-vc-properties FILES FORM SETTINGS)<br/>
<br/>
Execute FORM, then maybe set per-file properties for FILES.<br/>
If any of FILES is actually a directory, then do the same for all<br/>
buffers for files in that directory.<br/>
SETTINGS is an association list of property/value pairs.  After<br/>
executing FORM, set those properties from SETTINGS that have not yet<br/>
been updated to their corresponding values.
