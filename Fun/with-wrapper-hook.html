with-wrapper-hook is a Lisp macro in `subr.el'.<br/><br/>(with-wrapper-hook HOOK ARGS &rest BODY)<br/><br/>Run BODY, using wrapper functions from HOOK with additional ARGS.<br/>HOOK is an abnormal hook.  Each hook function in HOOK "wraps"<br/>around the preceding ones, like a set of nested `around' advices.<br/><br/>Each hook function should accept an argument list consisting of a<br/>function FUN, followed by the additional arguments in ARGS.<br/><br/>The first hook function in HOOK is passed a FUN that, if it is called<br/>with arguments ARGS, performs BODY (i.e., the default operation).<br/>The FUN passed to each successive hook function is defined based<br/>on the preceding hook functions; if called with arguments ARGS,<br/>it does what the `with-wrapper-hook' call would do if the<br/>preceding hook functions were the only ones present in HOOK.<br/><br/>Each hook function may call its FUN argument as many times as it wishes,<br/>including never.  In that case, such a hook function acts to replace<br/>the default definition altogether, and any preceding hook functions.<br/>Of course, a subsequent hook function may do the same thing.<br/><br/>Each hook function definition is used to construct the FUN passed<br/>to the next hook function, if any.  The last (or "outermost")<br/>FUN is then called once.
