write-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `files.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-x C-w, <menu-bar> <file> <write-file>.<br/><br/>(write-file FILENAME &optional CONFIRM)<br/><br/>Write current buffer into file FILENAME.<br/>This makes the buffer visit that file, and marks it as not modified.<br/><br/>If you specify just a directory name as FILENAME, that means to use<br/>the default file name but in that directory.  You can also yank<br/>the default file name into the minibuffer to edit it, using M-n.<br/><br/>If the buffer is not already visiting a file, the default file name<br/>for the output file is the buffer name.<br/><br/>If optional second arg CONFIRM is non-nil, this function<br/>asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing file.<br/>Interactively, confirmation is required unless you supply a prefix argument.
