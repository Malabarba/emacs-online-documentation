<strong>write-region</strong> is an interactive built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(write-region START END FILENAME &optional APPEND VISIT LOCKNAME MUSTBENEW)<br/>
<br/>
Write current region into specified file.<br/>
When called from a program, requires three arguments:<br/>
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are normally buffer positions<br/>
specifying the part of the buffer to write.<br/>
If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents.<br/>
If START is a string, then output that string to the file<br/>
instead of any buffer contents; END is ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Optional fourth argument APPEND if non-nil means<br/>
  append to existing file contents (if any).  If it is an integer,<br/>
  seek to that offset in the file before writing.<br/>
Optional fifth argument VISIT, if t or a string, means<br/>
  set the last-save-file-modtime of buffer to this file's modtime<br/>
  and mark buffer not modified.<br/>
If VISIT is a string, it is a second file name;<br/>
  the output goes to FILENAME, but the buffer is marked as visiting VISIT.<br/>
  VISIT is also the file name to lock and unlock for clash detection.<br/>
If VISIT is neither t nor nil nor a string,<br/>
  that means do not display the "Wrote file" message.<br/>
The optional sixth arg LOCKNAME, if non-nil, specifies the name to<br/>
  use for locking and unlocking, overriding FILENAME and VISIT.<br/>
The optional seventh arg MUSTBENEW, if non-nil, insists on a check<br/>
  for an existing file with the same name.  If MUSTBENEW is `excl',<br/>
  that means to get an error if the file already exists; never overwrite.<br/>
  If MUSTBENEW is neither nil nor `excl', that means ask for<br/>
  confirmation before overwriting, but do go ahead and overwrite the file<br/>
  if the user confirms.<br/>
<br/>
This does code conversion according to the value of<br/>
`coding-system-for-write', `buffer-file-coding-system', or<br/>
`file-coding-system-alist', and sets the variable<br/>
`last-coding-system-used' to the coding system actually used.<br/>
<br/>
This calls `write-region-annotate-functions' at the start, and<br/>
`write-region-post-annotation-function' at the end.
