converted to an atom and the value of the atom is used.  If an element<br/>
is a cons, it is converted to a 32 bit number where the car is the 16<br/>
top bits and the cdr is the lower 16 bits.<br/>

FRAME nil or omitted means use the selected frame.<br/>
If TYPE is given and non-nil, it is the name of the type of VALUE.<br/>
If TYPE is not given or nil, the type is STRING.<br/>
FORMAT gives the size in bits of each element if VALUE is a list.<br/>
It must be one of 8, 16 or 32.<br/>
If VALUE is a string or FORMAT is nil or not given, FORMAT defaults to 8.<br/>
If OUTER-P is non-nil, the property is changed for the outer X window of<br/>
FRAME.  Default is to change on the edit X window.
