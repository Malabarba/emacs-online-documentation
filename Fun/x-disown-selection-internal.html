<strong>x-disown-selection-internal</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(x-disown-selection-internal SELECTION &optional TIME-OBJECT TERMINAL)<br/>
<br/>
If we own the selection SELECTION, disown it.<br/>
Disowning it means there is no such selection.<br/>
<br/>
Sets the last-change time for the selection to TIME-OBJECT (by default<br/>
the time of the last event).<br/>
<br/>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X<br/>
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected<br/>
frame's display, or the first available X display.<br/>
<br/>
On Nextstep, the TIME-OBJECT and TERMINAL arguments are unused.<br/>
On MS-DOS, all this does is return non-nil if we own the selection.
