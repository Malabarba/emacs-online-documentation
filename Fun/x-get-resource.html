class, where INSTANCE is the name under which Emacs was invoked, or<br/>
the name specified by the `-name' or `-rn' command-line arguments.<br/>

class, respectively.  You must specify both of them or neither.<br/>
If you specify them, the key is `INSTANCE.COMPONENT.ATTRIBUTE'<br/>
and the class is `Emacs.CLASS.SUBCLASS'.
