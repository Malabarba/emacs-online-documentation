<strong>x-own-selection-internal</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(x-own-selection-internal <u>SELECTION</u> <u>VALUE</u> &optional <u>FRAME</u>)</br>
</br>
Assert an X selection of type <u>SELECTION</u> and value <u>VALUE</u>.</br>
<u>SELECTION</u> is a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.</br>
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)</br>
<u>VALUE</u> is typically a string, or a cons of two markers, but may be</br>
anything that the functions on `selection-converter-alist' know about.</br>
</br>
<u>FRAME</u> should be a frame that should own the selection.  If omitted or</br>
nil, it defaults to the selected frame.</br>
</br>
On Nextstep, <u>FRAME</u> is unused.
