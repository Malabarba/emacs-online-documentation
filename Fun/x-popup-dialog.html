<strong>x-popup-dialog</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(x-popup-dialog POSITION CONTENTS &optional HEADER)<br/>
<br/>
Pop up a dialog box and return user's selection.<br/>
POSITION specifies which frame to use.<br/>
This is normally a mouse button event or a window or frame.<br/>
If POSITION is t, it means to use the frame the mouse is on.<br/>
The dialog box appears in the middle of the specified frame.<br/>
<br/>
CONTENTS specifies the alternatives to display in the dialog box.<br/>
It is a list of the form (DIALOG ITEM1 ITEM2...).<br/>
Each ITEM is a cons cell (STRING . VALUE).<br/>
The return value is VALUE from the chosen item.<br/>
<br/>
An ITEM may also be just a string--that makes a nonselectable item.<br/>
An ITEM may also be nil--that means to put all preceding items<br/>
on the left of the dialog box and all following items on the right.<br/>
(By default, approximately half appear on each side.)<br/>
<br/>
If HEADER is non-nil, the frame title for the box is "Information",<br/>
otherwise it is "Question".<br/>
<br/>
If the user gets rid of the dialog box without making a valid choice,<br/>
for instance using the window manager, then this produces a quit and<br/>
`x-popup-dialog' does not return.
