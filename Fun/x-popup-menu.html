<strong>x-popup-menu</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(x-popup-menu POSITION MENU)<br/>
<br/>
Pop up a deck-of-cards menu and return user's selection.<br/>
POSITION is a position specification.  This is either a mouse button event<br/>
or a list ((XOFFSET YOFFSET) WINDOW)<br/>
where XOFFSET and YOFFSET are positions in pixels from the top left<br/>
corner of WINDOW.  (WINDOW may be a window or a frame object.)<br/>
This controls the position of the top left of the menu as a whole.<br/>
If POSITION is t, it means to use the current mouse position.<br/>
<br/>
MENU is a specifier for a menu.  For the simplest case, MENU is a keymap.<br/>
The menu items come from key bindings that have a menu string as well as<br/>
a definition; actually, the "definition" in such a key binding looks like<br/>
(STRING . REAL-DEFINITION).  To give the menu a title, put a string into<br/>
the keymap as a top-level element.<br/>
<br/>
If REAL-DEFINITION is nil, that puts a nonselectable string in the menu.<br/>
Otherwise, REAL-DEFINITION should be a valid key binding definition.<br/>
<br/>
You can also use a list of keymaps as MENU.<br/>
  Then each keymap makes a separate pane.<br/>
<br/>
When MENU is a keymap or a list of keymaps, the return value is the<br/>
list of events corresponding to the user's choice. Note that<br/>
`x-popup-menu' does not actually execute the command bound to that<br/>
sequence of events.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can specify a menu of multiple panes<br/>
  with a list of the form (TITLE PANE1 PANE2...),<br/>
where each pane is a list of form (TITLE ITEM1 ITEM2...).<br/>
Each ITEM is normally a cons cell (STRING . VALUE);<br/>
but a string can appear as an item--that makes a nonselectable line<br/>
in the menu.<br/>
With this form of menu, the return value is VALUE from the chosen item.<br/>
<br/>
If POSITION is nil, don't display the menu at all, just precalculate the<br/>
cached information about equivalent key sequences.<br/>
<br/>
If the user gets rid of the menu without making a valid choice, for<br/>
instance by clicking the mouse away from a valid choice or by typing<br/>
keyboard input, then this normally results in a quit and<br/>
`x-popup-menu' does not return.  But if POSITION is a mouse button<br/>
event (indicating that the user invoked the menu with the mouse) then<br/>
no quit occurs and `x-popup-menu' returns nil.
