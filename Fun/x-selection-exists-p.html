<strong>x-selection-exists-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(x-selection-exists-p &optional SELECTION TERMINAL)<br/>
<br/>
Whether there is an owner for the given X selection.<br/>
SELECTION should be the name of the selection in question, typically<br/>
one of the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', `CLIPBOARD', or<br/>
`CLIPBOARD_MANAGER' (X expects these literal upper-case names.)  The<br/>
symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY', and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.<br/>
<br/>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X<br/>
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected<br/>
frame's display, or the first available X display.<br/>
<br/>
On Nextstep, TERMINAL is unused.
