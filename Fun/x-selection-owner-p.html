<strong>x-selection-owner-p</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
</br>
(x-selection-owner-p &optional <u>SELECTION</u> <u>TERMINAL</u>)</br>
</br>
Whether the current Emacs process owns the given X Selection.</br>
The arg should be the name of the selection in question, typically one of</br>
the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.</br>
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)</br>
For convenience, the symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY',</br>
and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.</br>
</br>
<u>TERMINAL</u> should be a terminal object or a frame specifying the X</br>
server to query.  If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected</br>
frame's display, or the first available X display.</br>
</br>
On Nextstep, <u>TERMINAL</u> is unused.
