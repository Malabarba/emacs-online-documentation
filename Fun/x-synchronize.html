<strong>x-synchronize</strong> is a built-in function in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(x-synchronize ON &optional TERMINAL)<br/>
<br/>
If ON is non-nil, report X errors as soon as the erring request is made.<br/>
This function only has an effect on X Windows.  With MS Windows, it is<br/>
defined but does nothing.<br/>
<br/>
If ON is nil, allow buffering of requests.<br/>
Turning on synchronization prohibits the Xlib routines from buffering<br/>
requests and seriously degrades performance, but makes debugging much<br/>
easier.<br/>
The optional second argument TERMINAL specifies which display to act on.<br/>
TERMINAL should be a terminal object, a frame or a display name (a string).<br/>
If TERMINAL is omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.
