x-window-property is a built-in function in `C source code'.<br/><br/>(x-window-property PROP &optional FRAME TYPE SOURCE DELETE-P VECTOR-RET-P)<br/><br/>Value is the value of window property PROP on FRAME.<br/>If FRAME is nil or omitted, use the selected frame.<br/><br/>On X Windows, the following optional arguments are also accepted:<br/>If TYPE is nil or omitted, get the property as a string.<br/>Otherwise TYPE is the name of the atom that denotes the type expected.<br/>If SOURCE is non-nil, get the property on that window instead of from<br/>FRAME.  The number 0 denotes the root window.<br/>If DELETE-P is non-nil, delete the property after retrieving it.<br/>If VECTOR-RET-P is non-nil, don't return a string but a vector of values.<br/><br/>On MS Windows, this function accepts but ignores those optional arguments.<br/><br/>Value is nil if FRAME hasn't a property with name PROP or if PROP has<br/>no value of TYPE (always string in the MS Windows case).
