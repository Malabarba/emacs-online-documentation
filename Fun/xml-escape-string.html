<strong>xml-escape-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>xml.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(xml-escape-string STRING)<br/>
<br/>
Convert STRING into a string containing valid XML character data.<br/>
Replace occurrences of &<>'" in STRING with their default XML<br/>
entity references (e.g. replace each & with &amp;).<br/>
<br/>
XML character data must not contain & or < characters, nor the ><br/>
character under some circumstances.  The XML spec does not impose<br/>
restriction on " or ', but we just substitute for these too<br/>
(as is permitted by the spec).
