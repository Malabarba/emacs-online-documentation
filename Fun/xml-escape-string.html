<strong>xml-escape-string</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>xml.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
(xml-escape-string <u>STRING</u>)</br>
</br>
Convert <u>STRING</u> into a string containing valid XML character data.</br>
Replace occurrences of &&lt;>'" in <u>STRING</u> with their default XML</br>
entity references (e.g. replace each & with &amp;).</br>
</br>
XML character data must not contain & or &lt; characters, nor the ></br>
character under some circumstances.  The XML spec does not impose</br>
restriction on " or ', but we just substitute for these too</br>
(as is permitted by the spec).
