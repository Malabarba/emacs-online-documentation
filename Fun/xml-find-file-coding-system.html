(xml-find-file-coding-system ARGS)<br/>
<br/>
Determine the coding system of an XML file without a declaration.<br/>
Strictly speaking, the file should be utf-8, but mistakes are<br/>
made, and there are genuine cases where XML fragments are saved,<br/>
with the encoding properly specified in a master document, or<br/>
added by processing software.
