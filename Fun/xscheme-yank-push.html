<strong>xscheme-yank-push</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>xscheme.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(xscheme-yank-push ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Insert or replace a just-yanked expression with a more recent expression.<br/>
If the previous command was not a yank, it yanks.<br/>
Otherwise, the region contains a stretch of reinserted<br/>
expression.  yank-pop deletes that text and inserts in its<br/>
place a different expression.<br/>
<br/>
With no argument, the next more recent expression is inserted.<br/>
With argument n, the n'th more recent expression is inserted.<br/>
If n is negative, a less recent expression is used.<br/>
<br/>
The sequence of expressions wraps around, so that after the oldest one<br/>
comes the newest one.
