<strong>xterm-mouse-mode</strong> is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `<code>xt-mouse.el</code>'.</br>
</br>
</br>
(xterm-mouse-mode &optional <u>ARG</u>)</br>
</br>
Toggle XTerm mouse mode.</br>
With a prefix argument <u>ARG</u>, enable XTerm mouse mode if <u>ARG</u> is</br>
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable</br>
the mode if <u>ARG</u> is omitted or nil.</br>
</br>
Turn it on to use Emacs mouse commands, and off to use xterm mouse commands.</br>
This works in terminal emulators compatible with xterm.  It only</br>
works for simple uses of the mouse.  Basically, only non-modified</br>
single clicks are supported.  When turned on, the normal xterm</br>
mouse functionality for such clicks is still available by holding</br>
down the SHIFT key while pressing the mouse button.
