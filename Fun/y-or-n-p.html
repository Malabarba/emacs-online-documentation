<strong>y-or-n-p</strong> is a compiled Lisp function in `<code>subr.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
(y-or-n-p PROMPT)<br/>
<br/>
Ask user a "y or n" question.  Return t if answer is "y".<br/>
PROMPT is the string to display to ask the question.  It should<br/>
end in a space; `y-or-n-p' adds "(y or n) " to it.<br/>
<br/>
No confirmation of the answer is requested; a single character is<br/>
enough.  SPC also means yes, and DEL means no.<br/>
<br/>
To be precise, this function translates user input into responses<br/>
by consulting the bindings in `query-replace-map'; see the<br/>
documentation of that variable for more information.  In this<br/>
case, the useful bindings are `act', `skip', `recenter',<br/>
`scroll-up', `scroll-down', and `quit'.<br/>
An `act' response means yes, and a `skip' response means no.<br/>
A `quit' response means to invoke `keyboard-quit'.<br/>
If the user enters `recenter', `scroll-up', or `scroll-down'<br/>
responses, perform the requested window recentering or scrolling<br/>
and ask again.<br/>
<br/>
Under a windowing system a dialog box will be used if `last-nonmenu-event'<br/>
is nil and `use-dialog-box' is non-nil.
