<strong>yank-pop</strong> is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
<br/>
It is bound to M-y.<br/>
<br/>
(yank-pop &optional ARG)<br/>
<br/>
Replace just-yanked stretch of killed text with a different stretch.<br/>
This command is allowed only immediately after a `yank' or a `yank-pop'.<br/>
At such a time, the region contains a stretch of reinserted<br/>
previously-killed text.  `yank-pop' deletes that text and inserts in its<br/>
place a different stretch of killed text.<br/>
<br/>
With no argument, the previous kill is inserted.<br/>
With argument N, insert the Nth previous kill.<br/>
If N is negative, this is a more recent kill.<br/>
<br/>
The sequence of kills wraps around, so that after the oldest one<br/>
comes the newest one.<br/>
<br/>
When this command inserts killed text into the buffer, it honors<br/>
`yank-excluded-properties' and `yank-handler' as described in the<br/>
doc string for `insert-for-yank-1', which see.
