yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.<br/><br/>It is bound to C-y, <S-insertchar>, <S-insert>, <menu-bar> <edit> <paste>.<br/><br/>(yank &optional ARG)<br/><br/>Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.<br/>More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the<br/>stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point<br/>at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.<br/>With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.<br/>With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.<br/><br/>When this command inserts text into the buffer, it honors the<br/>`yank-handled-properties' and `yank-excluded-properties'<br/>variables, and the `yank-handler' text property.  See<br/>`insert-for-yank-1' for details.<br/><br/>See also the command `yank-pop' (M-y).<br/><br/>This function is advised.<br/><br/>Around-advice `ses-yank':<br/>In SES mode, the yanked text is inserted as cells.<br/><br/>If the text contains 'ses attributes (meaning it went to the kill-ring from a<br/>SES buffer), the formulas and print functions are restored for the cells.  If<br/>the text contains tabs, this is an insertion of tab-separated formulas.<br/>Otherwise the text is inserted as the formula for the current cell.<br/><br/>When inserting cells, the formulas are usually relocated to keep the same<br/>relative references to neighboring cells.  This is best if the formulas<br/>generally refer to other cells within the yanked text.  You can use the C-u<br/>prefix to specify insertion without relocation, which is best when the<br/>formulas refer to cells outside the yanked text.<br/><br/>When inserting formulas, the text is treated as a string constant if it doesn't<br/>make sense as a sexp or would otherwise be considered a symbol.  Use 'sym to<br/>explicitly insert a symbol, or use the C-u prefix to treat all unmarked words<br/>as symbols.
