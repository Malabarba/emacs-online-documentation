During IELM evaluation, most recent value evaluated in IELM.<br/>
Normally identical to `*'.  However, if the working buffer is an IELM<br/>
buffer, distinct from the process buffer, then `*' gives the value in<br/>
the working buffer, `*1' the value in the process buffer.<br/>
The intended value is only accessible during IELM evaluation.
