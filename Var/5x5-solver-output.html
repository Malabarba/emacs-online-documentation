List that is the output of an arithmetic solver.</br>
</br>
This list L is such that</br>
</br>
L = (M S_1 S_2 ... S_N)</br>
</br>
M is the move count when the solve output was stored.</br>
</br>
S_1 ... S_N are all the solutions ordered from least to greatest</br>
number of strokes.  S_1 is the solution to be displayed.</br>
</br>
Each solution S_1, ..., S_N is a list (STROKE-COUNT GRID) where</br>
STROKE-COUNT is the number of strokes to achieve the solution and</br>
GRID is the grid of positions to click.
