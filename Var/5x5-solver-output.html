5x5-solver-output is a variable defined in `5x5.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List that is the output of an arithmetic solver.<br/><br/>This list L is such that<br/><br/>L = (M S_1 S_2 ... S_N)<br/><br/>M is the move count when the solve output was stored.<br/><br/>S_1 ... S_N are all the solutions ordered from least to greatest<br/>number of strokes.  S_1 is the solution to be displayed.<br/><br/>Each solution S_1, ..., S_N is a list (STROKE-COUNT GRID) where<br/>STROKE-COUNT is the number of strokes to achieve the solution and<br/>GRID is the grid of positions to click.
