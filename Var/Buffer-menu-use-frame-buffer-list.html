Buffers that were never selected in that frame are listed at the end.</br>
If the value is nil, the Buffer Menu uses the global buffer list.</br>
This variable matters if the Buffer Menu is sorted by visited order,</br>
as it is by default.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
