Its value is <pre></br>
("/usr/local/share/info/" "/usr/share/info/" "/usr/local/share/info/")
</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Default list of directories to search for Info documentation files.</br>
They are searched in the order they are given in the list.</br>
Therefore, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs</br>
normally should come last (so that local files override standard ones),</br>
unless Emacs is installed into a non-standard directory.  In the latter</br>
case, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs should be</br>
first in this list.</br>
</br>
Once Info is started, the list of directories to search</br>
comes from the variable `Info-directory-list'.</br>
This variable `Info-default-directory-list' is used as the default</br>
for initializing `Info-directory-list' when Info is started, unless</br>
the environment variable INFOPATH is set.</br>
</br>
Although this is a customizable variable, that is mainly for technical</br>
reasons.  Normally, you should either set INFOPATH or customize</br>
`Info-additional-directory-list', rather than changing this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
