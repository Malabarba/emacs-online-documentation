<!DOCTYPE html><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en-us"><head><style type="text/css"> @import url('http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual.css');</style></head><body style="padding:1rem;"><strong>Info-directory-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of directories to search for Info documentation files.</br>
If nil, meaning not yet initialized, Info uses the environment</br>
variable INFOPATH to initialize it, or `Info-default-directory-list'</br>
if there is no INFOPATH variable in the environment, or the</br>
concatenation of the two if INFOPATH ends with a `path-separator'.</br>
</br>
When `Info-directory-list' is initialized from the value of</br>
`Info-default-directory-list', and Emacs is installed in one of the</br>
standard directories, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs</br>
is put last (so that local Info files override standard ones).</br>
</br>
When `Info-directory-list' is initialized from the value of</br>
`Info-default-directory-list', and Emacs is not installed in one</br>
of the standard directories, the first element of the resulting</br>
list is the directory where Emacs installs the Info files that</br>
come with it.  This is so that Emacs's own manual, which suits the</br>
version of Emacs you are using, will always be found first.  This</br>
is useful when you install an experimental version of Emacs without</br>
removing the standard installation.</br>
</br>
If you want to override the order of directories in</br>
`Info-default-directory-list', set INFOPATH in the environment.</br>
</br>
If you run the Emacs executable from the `src' directory in the Emacs</br>
source tree, and INFOPATH is not defined, the `info' directory in the</br>
source tree is used as the first element of `Info-directory-list', in</br>
place of the installation Info directory.  This is useful when you run</br>
a version of Emacs without installing it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
