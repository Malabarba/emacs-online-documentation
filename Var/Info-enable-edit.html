<strong>Info-enable-edit</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means the M-x Info-edit command in Info can edit the current node.<br/>
This is convenient if you want to write Info files by hand.<br/>
However, we recommend that you not do this.<br/>
It is better to write a Texinfo file and generate the Info file from that,<br/>
because that gives you a printed manual as well.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
