<strong>Info-hide-note-references</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, hide the tag and section reference in *note and * menu items.<br/>
If value is non-nil but not `hide', also replaces the "*note" with "see".<br/>
If value is non-nil but not t or `hide', the reference section is still shown.<br/>
`nil' completely disables this feature.  If this is non-nil, you might<br/>
want to set `Info-refill-paragraphs'.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
