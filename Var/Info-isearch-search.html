Info-isearch-search is a variable defined in `info.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, isearch in Info searches through multiple nodes.<br/>Before leaving the initial Info node, where isearch was started,<br/>it fails once with the error message [end of node], and with<br/>subsequent C-s/C-r continues through other nodes without failing<br/>with this error message in other nodes.  When isearch fails for<br/>the rest of the manual, it displays the error message [end of manual],<br/>wraps around the whole manual and restarts the search from the top/final<br/>node depending on search direction.<br/><br/>Setting this option to nil restores the default isearch behavior<br/>with wrapping around the current Info node.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
