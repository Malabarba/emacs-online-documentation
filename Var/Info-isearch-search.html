<strong>Info-isearch-search</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, isearch in Info searches through multiple nodes.</br>
Before leaving the initial Info node, where isearch was started,</br>
it fails once with the error message [end of node], and with</br>
subsequent C-s/C-r continues through other nodes without failing</br>
with this error message in other nodes.  When isearch fails for</br>
the rest of the manual, it displays the error message [end of manual],</br>
wraps around the whole manual and restarts the search from the top/final</br>
node depending on search direction.</br>
</br>
Setting this option to nil restores the default isearch behavior</br>
with wrapping around the current Info node.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
