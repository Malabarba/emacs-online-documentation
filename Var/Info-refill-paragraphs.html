<strong>Info-refill-paragraphs</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, attempt to refill paragraphs with hidden references.</br>
This refilling may accidentally remove explicit line breaks in the Info</br>
file, so be prepared for a few surprises if you enable this feature.</br>
This only has an effect if `Info-hide-note-references' is non-nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
