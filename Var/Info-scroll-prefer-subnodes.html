<strong>Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, SPC in a menu visits subnodes.<br/>
<br/>
If this is non-nil, and you scroll far enough in a node that its menu<br/>
appears on the screen, the next SPC<br/>
moves to a subnode indicated by the following menu item.  This means<br/>
that you visit a subnode before getting to the end of the menu.<br/>
<br/>
Setting this option to nil results in behavior similar to the stand-alone<br/>
Info reader program, which visits the first subnode from the menu only<br/>
when you hit the end of the current node.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
