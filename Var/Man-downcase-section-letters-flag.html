<strong>Man-downcase-section-letters-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>man.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means letters in sections are converted to lower case.<br/>
Some Un*x man commands can't handle uppercase letters in sections, for<br/>
example "man 2V chmod", but they are often displayed in the manpage<br/>
with the upper case letter.  When this variable is t, the section<br/>
letter (e.g., "2V") is converted to lowercase (e.g., "2v") before<br/>
being sent to the man background process.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
