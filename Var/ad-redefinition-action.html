<strong>ad-redefinition-action</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>advice.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>warn</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Defines what to do with redefinitions during Advice de/activation.</br>
Redefinition occurs if a previously activated function that already has an</br>
original definition associated with it gets redefined and then de/activated.</br>
In such a case we can either accept the current definition as the new</br>
original definition, discard the current definition and replace it with the</br>
old original, or keep it and raise an error.  The values `accept', `discard',</br>
`error' or `warn' govern what will be done.  `warn' is just like `accept' but</br>
it additionally prints a warning message.  All other values will be</br>
interpreted as `error'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
