<strong>ada-case-exception-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ada-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is ("~/.emacs_case_exceptions")<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of special casing exceptions dictionaries for identifiers.<br/>
The first file is the one where new exceptions will be saved by Emacs<br/>
when you call `ada-create-case-exception'.<br/>
<br/>
These files should contain one word per line, that gives the casing<br/>
to be used for that word in Ada files.  If the line starts with the<br/>
character *, then the exception will be used for substrings that either<br/>
start at the beginning of a word or after a _ character, and end either<br/>
at the end of the word or at a _ character.  Each line can be terminated<br/>
by a comment.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
