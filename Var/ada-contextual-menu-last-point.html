<strong>ada-contextual-menu-last-point</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ada-mode.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Position of point just before displaying the menu.</br>
This is a list (point buffer).</br>
Since `ada-popup-menu' moves the point where the user clicked, the region</br>
is modified.  Therefore no command from the menu knows what the user selected</br>
before displaying the contextual menu.</br>
To get the original region, restore the point to this position before</br>
calling `region-end' and `region-beginning'.</br>
Modify this variable if you want to restore the point to another position.
