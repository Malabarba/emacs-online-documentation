</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Regexp specifying whether to set fill prefix from a one-line paragraph.</br>
When a paragraph has just one line, then after `adaptive-fill-regexp'</br>
finds the prefix at the beginning of the line, if it doesn't</br>
match this regexp, it is replaced with whitespace.</br>
</br>
By default, this regexp matches sequences of just spaces and tabs.</br>
</br>
However, we never use a prefix from a one-line paragraph</br>
if it would act as a paragraph-starter on the second line.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
