adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp is a variable defined in `fill.el'.<br/>Its value is "\\`[ 	]*\\'"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Regexp specifying whether to set fill prefix from a one-line paragraph.<br/>When a paragraph has just one line, then after `adaptive-fill-regexp'<br/>finds the prefix at the beginning of the line, if it doesn't<br/>match this regexp, it is replaced with whitespace.<br/><br/>By default, this regexp matches sequences of just spaces and tabs.<br/><br/>However, we never use a prefix from a one-line paragraph<br/>if it would act as a paragraph-starter on the second line.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
