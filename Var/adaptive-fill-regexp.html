<strong>adaptive-fill-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>fill.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "[ 	]*\\([-–!|#%;>*·•‣⁃◦]+[ 	]*\\)*"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp to match text at start of line that constitutes indentation.<br/>
If Adaptive Fill mode is enabled, a prefix matching this pattern<br/>
on the first and second lines of a paragraph is used as the<br/>
standard indentation for the whole paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
If the paragraph has just one line, the indentation is taken from that<br/>
line, but in that case `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp' also plays<br/>
a role.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
