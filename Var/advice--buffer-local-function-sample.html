<strong>advice--buffer-local-function-sample</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>nadvice.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
keeps an example of the special "run the default value" functions.</br>
These functions play the same role as t in buffer-local hooks, and to recognize</br>
them, we keep a sample here against which to compare.  Each instance is</br>
different, but `function-equal' will hopefully ignore those differences.
