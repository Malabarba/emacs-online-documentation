after-change-functions is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is (jit-lock-after-change t)<br/>Local in buffer doc-to-html.el; global value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of functions to call after each text change.<br/>Three arguments are passed to each function: the positions of<br/>the beginning and end of the range of changed text,<br/>and the length in bytes of the pre-change text replaced by that range.<br/>(For an insertion, the pre-change length is zero;<br/>for a deletion, that length is the number of bytes deleted,<br/>and the post-change beginning and end are at the same place.)<br/><br/>Buffer changes made while executing the `after-change-functions'<br/>don't call any before-change or after-change functions.<br/>That's because `inhibit-modification-hooks' is temporarily set non-nil.<br/><br/>If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,<br/>the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error<br/>from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.
