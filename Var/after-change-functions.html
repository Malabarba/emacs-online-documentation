List of functions to call after each text change.</br>
Three arguments are passed to each function: the positions of</br>
the beginning and end of the range of changed text,</br>
and the length in bytes of the pre-change text replaced by that range.</br>
(For an insertion, the pre-change length is zero;</br>
for a deletion, that length is the number of bytes deleted,</br>
and the post-change beginning and end are at the same place.)</br>
</br>
Buffer changes made while executing the `after-change-functions'</br>
don't call any before-change or after-change functions.</br>
That's because `inhibit-modification-hooks' is temporarily set non-nil.</br>
</br>
If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,</br>
the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error</br>
from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.
