A list of functions to be called at the end of `insert-file-contents'.<br/>
Each is passed one argument, the number of characters inserted,<br/>
with point at the start of the inserted text.  Each function<br/>
should leave point the same, and return the new character count.<br/>
If `insert-file-contents' is intercepted by a handler from<br/>
`file-name-handler-alist', that handler is responsible for calling the<br/>
functions in `after-insert-file-functions' if appropriate.
