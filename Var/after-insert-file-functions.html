A list of functions to be called at the end of `insert-file-contents'.</br>
Each is passed one argument, the number of characters inserted,</br>
with point at the start of the inserted text.  Each function</br>
should leave point the same, and return the new character count.</br>
If `insert-file-contents' is intercepted by a handler from</br>
`file-name-handler-alist', that handler is responsible for calling the</br>
functions in `after-insert-file-functions' if appropriate.
