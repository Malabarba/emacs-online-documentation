<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run after reverting.<br/>
Note that the hook value that it runs is the value that was in effect<br/>
before reverting; that makes a difference if you have buffer-local<br/>
hook functions.<br/>
<br/>
If `revert-buffer-function' is used to override the normal revert<br/>
mechanism, this hook is not used.
