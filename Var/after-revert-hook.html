Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run after reverting.</br>
Note that the hook value that it runs is the value that was in effect</br>
before reverting; that makes a difference if you have buffer-local</br>
hook functions.</br>
</br>
If `revert-buffer-function' is used to override the normal revert</br>
mechanism, this hook is not used.
