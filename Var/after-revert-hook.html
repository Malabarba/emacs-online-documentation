Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run after reverting.</br>
Note that the hook value that it runs is the value that was in effect</br>
before reverting; that makes a difference if you have buffer-local</br>
hook functions.</br>
</br>
The function `revert-buffer--default' runs this.</br>
A customized `revert-buffer-function' need not run this hook.
