<strong>align-region-heuristic</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>align.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 500<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, used as a heuristic by `align-current'.<br/>
Since each alignment rule can possibly have its own set of alignment<br/>
sections (whenever `align-region-separate' is non-nil, and not a<br/>
string), this heuristic is used to determine how far before and after<br/>
point we should search in looking for a region separator.  Larger<br/>
values can mean slower performance in large files, although smaller<br/>
values may cause unexpected behavior at times.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
