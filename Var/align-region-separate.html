align-region-separate is a variable defined in `align.el'.<br/>Its value is "^\\s-*[{}]?\\s-*$"<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Select the method by which alignment sections will be separated.<br/>If this is a symbol, that symbol's value will be used.<br/><br/>For the sake of clarification, consider the following example, which<br/>will be referred to in the descriptions below.<br/><br/>    int alpha = 1; /* one */<br/>    double beta = 2.0;<br/>    long gamma; /* ten */<br/><br/>    unsigned int delta = 1; /* one */<br/>    long double epsilon = 3.0;<br/>    long long omega; /* ten */<br/><br/>The possible settings for `align-region-separate' are:<br/><br/> `entire'  The entire region being aligned will be considered as a<br/>	   single alignment section.  Assuming that comments were not<br/>	   being aligned to a particular column, the example would<br/>	   become:<br/><br/>	     int          alpha    = 1;   /* one */<br/>	     double       beta     = 2.0;<br/>	     long         gamma;          /* ten */<br/><br/>	     unsigned int delta    = 1;   /* one */<br/>	     long double  epsilon;<br/>	     long long    chi      = 10;  /* ten */<br/><br/> `group'   Each contiguous set of lines where a specific alignment<br/>	   occurs is considered a section for that alignment rule.<br/>	   Note that each rule may have any entirely different set<br/>           of section divisions than another.<br/><br/>	     int    alpha = 1; /* one */<br/>	     double beta  = 2.0;<br/>	     long   gamma; /* ten */<br/><br/>	     unsigned int delta = 1; /* one */<br/>	     long double  epsilon;<br/>	     long long    chi = 10; /* ten */<br/><br/> `largest' When contiguous rule sets overlap, the largest section<br/>	   described will be taken as the alignment section for each<br/>	   rule touched by that section.<br/><br/>	     int    alpha = 1;   /* one */<br/>	     double beta  = 2.0;<br/>	     long   gamma;       /* ten */<br/><br/>	     unsigned int delta    = 1;  /* one */<br/>	     long double  epsilon;<br/>	     long long    chi      = 10; /* ten */<br/><br/>	   NOTE: This option is not supported yet, due to algorithmic<br/>	   issues which haven't been satisfactorily resolved.  There<br/>	   are ways to do it, but they're both ugly and resource<br/>	   consumptive.<br/><br/> regexp    A regular expression string which defines the section<br/>	   divider.  If the mode you're in has a consistent divider<br/>	   between sections, the behavior will be very similar to<br/>	   `largest', and faster.  But if the mode does not use clear<br/>	   separators (for example, if you collapse your braces onto<br/>	   the preceding statement in C or Perl), `largest' is<br/>	   probably the better alternative.<br/><br/> function  A function that will be passed the beginning and ending<br/>	   locations of the region in which to look for the section<br/>	   separator.  At the very beginning of the attempt to align,<br/>	   both of these parameters will be nil, in which case the<br/>	   function should return non-nil if it wants each rule to<br/>	   define its own section, or nil if it wants the largest<br/>	   section found to be used as the common section for all<br/>	   rules that occur there.<br/><br/> list      A list of markers within the buffer that represent where<br/>	   the section dividers lie.  Be certain to use markers!  For<br/>	   when the aligning begins, the ensuing contract/expanding of<br/>	   whitespace will throw off any non-marker positions.<br/><br/>	   This method is intended for use in Lisp programs, and not<br/>	   by the user.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
