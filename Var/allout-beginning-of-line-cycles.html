<strong>allout-beginning-of-line-cycles</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, M-x allout-beginning-of-line will cycle through smart-placement options.<br/>
<br/>
Cycling only happens on when the command is repeated, not when it<br/>
follows a different command.<br/>
<br/>
Smart-placement means that repeated calls to this function will<br/>
advance as follows:<br/>
<br/>
 - if the cursor is on a non-headline body line and not on the first column:<br/>
   then it goes to the first column<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the first column of a non-headline body line:<br/>
   then it goes to the start of the headline within the item body<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the headline and not the start of the headline:<br/>
   then it goes to the start of the headline<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the start of the headline:<br/>
   then it goes to the bullet character (for hotspot navigation)<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the bullet character:<br/>
   then it goes to the first column of that line (the headline)<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the first column of the headline:<br/>
   then it goes to the start of the headline within the item body.<br/>
<br/>
In this fashion, you can use the beginning-of-line command to do<br/>
its normal job and then, when repeated, advance through the<br/>
entry, cycling back to start.<br/>
<br/>
If this configuration variable is nil, then the cursor is just<br/>
advanced to the beginning of the line and remains there on<br/>
repeated calls.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
