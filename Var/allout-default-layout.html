<strong>allout-default-layout</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is (-2 : 0)<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Default allout outline layout specification.<br/>
<br/>
This setting specifies the outline exposure to use when<br/>
`allout-layout' has the local value `t'.  This docstring describes the<br/>
layout specifications.<br/>
<br/>
A list value specifies a default layout for the current buffer,<br/>
to be applied upon activation of `allout-mode'.  Any non-nil<br/>
value will automatically trigger `allout-mode', provided<br/>
`allout-auto-activation' has been customized to enable it.<br/>
<br/>
The types of elements in the layout specification are:<br/>
<br/>
 INTEGER -- dictate the relative depth to open the corresponding topic(s),<br/>
            where:<br/>
         -- negative numbers force the topic to be closed before opening<br/>
            to the absolute value of the number, so all siblings are open<br/>
            only to that level.<br/>
         -- positive numbers open to the relative depth indicated by the<br/>
            number, but do not force already opened subtopics to be closed.<br/>
         -- 0 means to close topic -- hide all subitems.<br/>
 :   -- repeat spec -- apply the preceding element to all siblings at<br/>
        current level, *up to* those siblings that would be covered by specs<br/>
        following the `:' on the list.  Ie, apply to all topics at level but<br/>
        trailing ones accounted for by trailing specs.  (Only the first of<br/>
        multiple colons at the same level is honored -- later ones are ignored.)<br/>
 *   -- completely exposes the topic, including bodies<br/>
 +   -- exposes all subtopics, but not the bodies<br/>
 -   -- exposes the body of the corresponding topic, but not subtopics<br/>
 LIST -- a nested layout spec, to be applied intricately to its<br/>
        corresponding item(s)<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
 (-2 : 0)<br/>
	Collapse the top-level topics to show their children and<br/>
        grandchildren, but completely collapse the final top-level topic.<br/>
 (-1 () : 1 0)<br/>
	Close the first topic so only the immediate subtopics are shown,<br/>
        leave the subsequent topics exposed as they are until the second<br/>
	second to last topic, which is exposed at least one level, and<br/>
        completely close the last topic.<br/>
 (-2 : -1 *)<br/>
        Expose children and grandchildren of all topics at current<br/>
	level except the last two; expose children of the second to<br/>
	last and completely expose the last one, including its subtopics.<br/>
<br/>
See `allout-expose-topic' for more about the exposure process.<br/>
<br/>
Also, allout's mode-specific provisions will make topic prefixes default<br/>
to the comment-start string, if any, of the language of the file.  This<br/>
is modulo the setting of `allout-use-mode-specific-leader', which see.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
