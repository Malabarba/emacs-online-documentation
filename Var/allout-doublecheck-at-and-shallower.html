Validate apparent topics of this depth and shallower as being non-aberrant.</br>
</br>
Verified with `allout-aberrant-container-p'.  The usefulness of</br>
this check is limited to shallow depths, because the</br>
determination of aberrance is according to the mistaken item</br>
being followed by a legitimate item of excessively greater depth.</br>
</br>
The classic example of a mistaken item, for a standard allout</br>
outline configuration, is a body line that begins with an '...'</br>
ellipsis.  This happens to contain a legitimate depth-2 header</br>
prefix, constituted by two '..' dots at the beginning of the</br>
line.  The only thing that can distinguish it *in principle* from</br>
a legitimate one is if the following real header is at a depth</br>
that is discontinuous from the depth of 2 implied by the</br>
ellipsis, ie depth 4 or more.  As the depth being tested gets</br>
greater, the likelihood of this kind of disqualification is</br>
lower, and the usefulness of this test is lower.</br>
</br>
Extending the depth of the doublecheck increases the amount it is</br>
applied, increasing the cost of the test - on casual estimation,</br>
for outlines with many deep topics, geometrically (O(n)?).</br>
Taken together with decreasing likelihood that the test will be</br>
useful at greater depths, more modest doublecheck limits are more</br>
suitably economical.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
