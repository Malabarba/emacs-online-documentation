<strong>allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, topics pending encryption are encrypted during buffer saves.</br>
</br>
This prevents file-system exposure of un-encrypted contents of</br>
items marked for encryption.</br>
</br>
When non-nil, if the topic currently being edited is decrypted,</br>
it will be encrypted for saving but automatically decrypted</br>
before any subsequent user interaction, so it is once again clear</br>
text for editing though the file system copy is encrypted.</br>
</br>
(Auto-saves are handled differently.  Buffers with plain-text</br>
exposed encrypted topics are exempted from auto saves until all</br>
such topics are encrypted.)</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
