Variable for regexps matching plaintext to remove before encryption.</br>
</br>
This is used to detect strings in encryption results that would</br>
register as allout mode structural elements, for example, as a</br>
topic prefix.</br>
</br>
Entries must be symbols that are bound to the desired regexp values.</br>
</br>
Encryptions that result in matches will be retried, up to</br>
`allout-encryption-ciphertext-rejection-limit' times, after which</br>
an error is raised.
