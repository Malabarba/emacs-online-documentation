Documentation:<br/>
Variable for regexps matching plaintext to remove before encryption.<br/>
<br/>
This is used to detect strings in encryption results that would<br/>
register as allout mode structural elements, for example, as a<br/>
topic prefix.<br/>
<br/>
Entries must be symbols that are bound to the desired regexp values.<br/>
<br/>
Encryptions that result in matches will be retried, up to<br/>
`allout-encryption-ciphertext-rejection-limit' times, after which<br/>
an error is raised.
