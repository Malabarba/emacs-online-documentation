List of regexps whose matches are removed from plaintext before encryption.</br>
</br>
This is for the sake of removing artifacts, like escapes, that are added on</br>
and not actually part of the original plaintext.  The removal is done just</br>
prior to encryption.</br>
</br>
Entries must be symbols that are bound to the desired values.</br>
</br>
Each value can be a regexp or a list with a regexp followed by a</br>
substitution string.  If it's just a regexp, all its matches are removed</br>
before the text is encrypted.  If it's a regexp and a substitution, the</br>
substitution is used against the regexp matches, a la `replace-match'.
