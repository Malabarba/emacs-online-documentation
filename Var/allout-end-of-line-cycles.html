<strong>allout-end-of-line-cycles</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, M-x allout-end-of-line will cycle through smart-placement options.<br/>
<br/>
Cycling only happens on when the command is repeated, not when it<br/>
follows a different command.<br/>
<br/>
Smart placement means that repeated calls to this function will<br/>
advance as follows:<br/>
<br/>
 - if the cursor is not on the end-of-line,<br/>
   then it goes to the end-of-line<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the end-of-line but not the end-of-entry,<br/>
   then it goes to the end-of-entry, exposing it if necessary<br/>
 - if the cursor is on the end-of-entry,<br/>
   then it goes to the end of the head line<br/>
<br/>
In this fashion, you can use the end-of-line command to do its<br/>
normal job and then, when repeated, advance through the entry,<br/>
cycling back to start.<br/>
<br/>
If this configuration variable is nil, then the cursor is just<br/>
advanced to the end of the line and remains there on repeated<br/>
calls.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
