<strong>allout-layout</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li><li>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value</br>
  satisfies the predicate which is a byte-compiled expression.</br>
</ul></br>

Buffer-specific setting for allout layout.</br>
</br>
In buffers where this is non-nil (and if `allout-auto-activation'</br>
has been customized to enable this behavior), `allout-mode' will be</br>
automatically activated.  The layout dictated by the value will be used to</br>
set the initial exposure when `allout-mode' is activated.</br>
</br>
*You should not setq-default this variable non-nil unless you want every</br>
visited file to be treated as an allout file.*</br>
</br>
The value would typically be set by a file local variable.  For</br>
example, the following lines at the bottom of an Emacs Lisp file:</br>
</br>
;;;Local variables:</br>
;;;allout-layout: (0 : -1 -1 0)</br>
;;;End:</br>
</br>
dictate activation of `allout-mode' mode when the file is visited</br>
(presuming proper `allout-auto-activation' customization),</br>
followed by the equivalent of `(allout-expose-topic 0 : -1 -1 0)'.</br>
(This is the layout used for the allout.el source file.)</br>
</br>
`allout-default-layout' describes the specification format.</br>
`allout-layout' can additionally have the value `t', in which</br>
case the value of `allout-default-layout' is used.
