<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Specific allout-prefix leading strings per major modes.</br>
</br>
Use this if the mode's comment-start string isn't what you</br>
prefer, or if the mode lacks a comment-start string.  See</br>
`allout-use-mode-specific-leader' for more details.</br>
</br>
If you're constructing a string that will comment-out outline</br>
structuring so it can be included in program code, append an extra</br>
character, like an "_" underscore, to distinguish the lead string</br>
from regular comments that start at the beginning-of-line.
