Setting used to test solicited encryption passphrases against the one</br>
already associated with a file.</br>
</br>
It consists of an encrypted random string useful only to verify that a</br>
passphrase entered by the user is effective for decryption.  The passphrase</br>
itself is *not* recorded in the file anywhere, and the encrypted contents</br>
are random binary characters to avoid exposing greater susceptibility to</br>
search attacks.</br>
</br>
The verifier string is retained as an Emacs file variable, as well as in</br>
the Emacs buffer state, if file variable adjustments are enabled.  See</br>
`allout-enable-file-variable-adjustment' for details about that.
