<strong>allout-run-unit-tests-on-load</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
When non-nil, unit tests will be run at end of loading the allout module.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, allout code developers are the only ones who'll want to set this.<br/>
<br/>
(If set, this makes it an even better practice to exercise changes by<br/>
doing byte-compilation with a repeat count, so the file is loaded after<br/>
compilation.)<br/>
<br/>
See `allout-run-unit-tests' to see what's run.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
