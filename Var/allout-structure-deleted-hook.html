Abnormal hook run after deleting subtrees from an Allout outline.</br>
Functions on the hook must take two arguments:</br>
</br>
 - DEPTH -- integer indicating the depth of the subtree that was deleted.</br>
 - REMOVED-FROM -- integer indicating the point where the subtree was removed.</br>
</br>
Some edits that remove or invalidate items may be missed by this hook:</br>
specifically edits that native allout routines do not control.</br>
</br>
This hook might be invoked multiple times by a single command.</br>
