Abnormal hook run after shifting items in an Allout outline.</br>
Functions on the hook should take two arguments:</br>
</br>
 - DEPTH-CHANGE -- integer indicating depth increase, negative for decrease</br>
 - START -- integer indicating the start point of the shifted parent item.</br>
</br>
Some edits that shift items can be missed by this hook: specifically edits</br>
that native allout routines do not control.</br>
</br>
This hook might be invoked multiple times by a single command.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
