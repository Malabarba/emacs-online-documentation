<strong>allout-widgets-run-unit-tests-on-load</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>allout-widgets.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, unit tests will be run at end of loading allout-widgets.</br>
</br>
Generally, allout widgets code developers are the only ones who'll want to</br>
set this.</br>
</br>
(If set, this makes it an even better practice to exercise changes by</br>
doing byte-compilation with a repeat count, so the file is loaded after</br>
compilation.)</br>
</br>
See `allout-widgets-run-unit-tests' to see what's run.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
