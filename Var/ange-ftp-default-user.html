<strong>ange-ftp-default-user</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ange-ftp.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
User name to use when none is specified in a file name.</br>
</br>
If non-nil but not a string, you are prompted for the name.</br>
If nil, the value of `ange-ftp-netrc-default-user' is used.</br>
If that is nil too, then your login name is used.</br>
</br>
Once a connection to a given host has been initiated, the user name</br>
and password information for that host are cached and re-used by</br>
ange-ftp.  Use M-x ange-ftp-set-user to change the cached values,</br>
since setting `ange-ftp-default-user' directly does not affect</br>
the cached information.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
