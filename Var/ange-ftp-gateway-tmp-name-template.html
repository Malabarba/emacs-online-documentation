</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Template used to create temporary files when FTP-ing through a gateway.</br>
</br>
Files starting with this prefix need to be accessible from BOTH the local</br>
machine and the gateway machine, and need to have the SAME name on both</br>
machines, that is, /tmp is probably NOT what you want, since that is rarely</br>
cross-mounted.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
