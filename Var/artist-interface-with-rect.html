<strong>artist-interface-with-rect</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>artist.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Whether to interface with the rect package or not.<br/>
<br/>
Interfacing to the rect package means that the Copy and Paste operations<br/>
will use the rectangle buffer when accessing the copied area.  This means<br/>
that you can insert a rectangle which is copied using the artist package<br/>
and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
If this causes any problem for you (for example, if the implementation of<br/>
the rectangle package changes), you can set this variable to nil, and the<br/>
artist package will use its own copy buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
