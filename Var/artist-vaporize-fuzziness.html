How to vaporize lines that are cut off.</br>
</br>
Accept this many characters cutting off a line and still treat</br>
it as one line.</br>
Example:</br>
 If `artist-vaporize-fuzziness' is 2, then those will be recognized as</br>
 lines from A to B (provided you start vaporizing them at the ``*''):</br>
                         /</br>
            A----*------/-----------B</br>
                      \/</br>
            A----*----/\------------B</br>
                     /  \</br>
</br>
 but this one won't, since it is cut off by more than 2 characters:</br>
                      \/ /</br>
            A----*----/\/----------B</br>
                     / /\</br>
 (in fact, only the left part [between the A and the leftmost ``/''</br>
 crossing the line] will be vaporized).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
