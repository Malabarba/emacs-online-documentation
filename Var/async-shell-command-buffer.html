<strong>async-shell-command-buffer</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>simple.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is confirm-new-buffer<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
What to do when the output buffer is used by another shell command.<br/>
This option specifies how to resolve the conflict where a new command<br/>
wants to direct its output to the buffer `*Async Shell Command*',<br/>
but this buffer is already taken by another running shell command.<br/>
<br/>
The value `confirm-kill-process' is used to ask for confirmation before<br/>
killing the already running process and running a new process<br/>
in the same buffer, `confirm-new-buffer' for confirmation before running<br/>
the command in a new buffer with a name other than the default buffer name,<br/>
`new-buffer' for doing the same without confirmation,<br/>
`confirm-rename-buffer' for confirmation before renaming the existing<br/>
output buffer and running a new command in the default buffer,<br/>
`rename-buffer' for doing the same without confirmation.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.3 of Emacs.<br/>
