Its value is <pre>confirm-new-buffer</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
What to do when the output buffer is used by another shell command.</br>
This option specifies how to resolve the conflict where a new command</br>
wants to direct its output to the buffer `*Async Shell Command*',</br>
but this buffer is already taken by another running shell command.</br>
</br>
The value `confirm-kill-process' is used to ask for confirmation before</br>
killing the already running process and running a new process</br>
in the same buffer, `confirm-new-buffer' for confirmation before running</br>
the command in a new buffer with a name other than the default buffer name,</br>
`new-buffer' for doing the same without confirmation,</br>
`confirm-rename-buffer' for confirmation before renaming the existing</br>
output buffer and running a new command in the default buffer,</br>
`rename-buffer' for doing the same without confirmation.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
