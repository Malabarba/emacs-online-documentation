<strong>auth-source-debug</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>auth-source.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Whether auth-source should log debug messages.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is nil, debug messages are not logged.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is t, debug messages are logged with `message'.  In<br/>
that case, your authentication data will be in the clear (except<br/>
for passwords).<br/>
<br/>
If the value is a function, debug messages are logged by calling<br/>
 that function using the same arguments as `message'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
