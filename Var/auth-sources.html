The default will get login and password information from<br/>
"~/.authinfo.gpg", which you should set up with the EPA/EPG<br/>
packages to be encrypted.  If that file doesn't exist, it will<br/>
try the unencrypted version "~/.authinfo" and the famous<br/>
"~/.netrc" file.<br/>
<br/>
See the auth.info manual for details.<br/>
<br/>
Each entry is the authentication type with optional properties.<br/>
