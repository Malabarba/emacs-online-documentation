Documentation:<br/>
Function to call to compose characters automatically.<br/>
This function is called from the display routine with four arguments:<br/>
FROM, TO, WINDOW, and STRING.<br/>
<br/>
If STRING is nil, the function must compose characters in the region<br/>
between FROM and TO in the current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, STRING is a string, and FROM and TO are indices into the<br/>
string.  In this case, the function must compose characters in the<br/>
string.
