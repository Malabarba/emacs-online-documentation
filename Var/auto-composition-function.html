Function to call to compose characters automatically.</br>
This function is called from the display routine with four arguments:</br>
FROM, TO, WINDOW, and STRING.</br>
</br>
If STRING is nil, the function must compose characters in the region</br>
between FROM and TO in the current buffer.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, STRING is a string, and FROM and TO are indices into the</br>
string.  In this case, the function must compose characters in the</br>
string.
