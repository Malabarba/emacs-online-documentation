Non-nil means to try second pass through `auto-mode-alist'.</br>
This means that if the first case-sensitive search through the alist fails</br>
to find a matching major mode, a second case-insensitive search is made.</br>
On systems with case-insensitive file names, this variable is ignored,</br>
since only a single case-insensitive search through the alist is made.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
