Regexp matching interpreters, for file mode determination.<br/>
This regular expression is matched against the first line of a file<br/>
to determine the file's mode in `set-auto-mode'.  If it matches, the file<br/>
is assumed to be interpreted by the interpreter matched by the second group<br/>
of the regular expression.  The mode is then determined as the mode<br/>
associated with that interpreter in `interpreter-mode-alist'.
