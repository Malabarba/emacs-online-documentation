Non-nil means automatically resize tool-bars.<br/>
This dynamically changes the tool-bar's height to the minimum height<br/>
that is needed to make all tool-bar items visible.<br/>
If value is `grow-only', the tool-bar's height is only increased<br/>
automatically; to decrease the tool-bar height, use M-x recenter.
