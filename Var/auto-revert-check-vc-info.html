Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil Auto Revert Mode reliably updates version control info.</br>
Auto Revert Mode updates version control info whenever the buffer</br>
needs reverting, regardless of the value of this variable.</br>
However, the version control state can change without changes to</br>
the work file.  If the change is made from the current Emacs</br>
session, all info is updated.  But if, for instance, a new</br>
version is checked in from outside the current Emacs session, the</br>
version control number in the mode line, as well as other version</br>
control related information, may not be properly updated.  If you</br>
are worried about this, set this variable to a non-nil value.</br>
</br>
This currently works by automatically updating the version</br>
control info every `auto-revert-interval' seconds.  Nevertheless,</br>
it should not cause excessive CPU usage on a reasonably fast</br>
machine, if it does not apply to too many version controlled</br>
buffers.  CPU usage depends on the version control system.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
