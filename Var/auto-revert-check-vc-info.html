<strong>auto-revert-check-vc-info</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>autorevert.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil Auto Revert Mode reliably updates version control info.<br/>
Auto Revert Mode updates version control info whenever the buffer<br/>
needs reverting, regardless of the value of this variable.<br/>
However, the version control state can change without changes to<br/>
the work file.  If the change is made from the current Emacs<br/>
session, all info is updated.  But if, for instance, a new<br/>
version is checked in from outside the current Emacs session, the<br/>
version control number in the mode line, as well as other version<br/>
control related information, may not be properly updated.  If you<br/>
are worried about this, set this variable to a non-nil value.<br/>
<br/>
This currently works by automatically updating the version<br/>
control info every `auto-revert-interval' seconds.  Nevertheless,<br/>
it should not cause excessive CPU usage on a reasonably fast<br/>
machine, if it does not apply to too many version controlled<br/>
buffers.  CPU usage depends on the version control system.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
