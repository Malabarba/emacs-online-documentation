<strong>auto-revert-interval</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>autorevert.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>5</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Time, in seconds, between Auto-Revert Mode file checks.</br>
The value may be an integer or floating point number.</br>
</br>
If a timer is already active, there are two ways to make sure</br>
that the new value will take effect immediately.  You can set</br>
this variable through Custom or you can call the command</br>
`auto-revert-set-timer' after setting the variable.  Otherwise,</br>
the new value will take effect the first time Auto Revert Mode</br>
calls `auto-revert-set-timer' for internal reasons or in your</br>
next editing session.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
