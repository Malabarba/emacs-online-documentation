<strong>auto-revert-stop-on-user-input</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>autorevert.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, user input temporarily interrupts Auto-Revert Mode.</br>
With this setting, Auto-Revert Mode checks for user input after</br>
handling each buffer and does not process any further buffers</br>
(until the next run of the timer) if user input is available.</br>
When nil, Auto-Revert Mode checks files and reverts buffers,</br>
with quitting disabled, without paying attention to user input.</br>
Thus, with this setting, Emacs might be non-responsive at times.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
