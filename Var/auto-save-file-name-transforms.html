auto-save-file-name-transforms is a variable defined in `files.el'.<br/>Its value is (("\\`/[^/]*:\\([^/]*/\\)*\\([^/]*\\)\\'" "/tmp/\\2" t))<br/><br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Transforms to apply to buffer file name before making auto-save file name.<br/>Each transform is a list (REGEXP REPLACEMENT UNIQUIFY):<br/>REGEXP is a regular expression to match against the file name.<br/>If it matches, `replace-match' is used to replace the<br/>matching part with REPLACEMENT.<br/>If the optional element UNIQUIFY is non-nil, the auto-save file name is<br/>constructed by taking the directory part of the replaced file-name,<br/>concatenated with the buffer file name with all directory separators<br/>changed to `!' to prevent clashes.  This will not work<br/>correctly if your filesystem truncates the resulting name.<br/><br/>All the transforms in the list are tried, in the order they are listed.<br/>When one transform applies, its result is final;<br/>no further transforms are tried.<br/><br/>The default value is set up to put the auto-save file into the<br/>temporary directory (see the variable `temporary-file-directory') for<br/>editing a remote file.<br/><br/>On MS-DOS filesystems without long names this variable is always<br/>ignored.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 21.1 of Emacs.<br/>
