Transforms to apply to buffer file name before making auto-save file name.</br>
Each transform is a list (REGEXP REPLACEMENT UNIQUIFY):</br>
REGEXP is a regular expression to match against the file name.</br>
If it matches, `replace-match' is used to replace the</br>
matching part with REPLACEMENT.</br>
If the optional element UNIQUIFY is non-nil, the auto-save file name is</br>
constructed by taking the directory part of the replaced file-name,</br>
concatenated with the buffer file name with all directory separators</br>
changed to `!' to prevent clashes.  This will not work</br>
correctly if your filesystem truncates the resulting name.</br>
</br>
All the transforms in the list are tried, in the order they are listed.</br>
When one transform applies, its result is final;</br>
no further transforms are tried.</br>
</br>
The default value is set up to put the auto-save file into the</br>
temporary directory (see the variable `temporary-file-directory') for</br>
editing a remote file.</br>
</br>
On MS-DOS filesystems without long names this variable is always</br>
ignored.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
