<strong>auto-save-include-big-deletions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

If non-nil, auto-save even if a large part of the text is deleted.</br>
If nil, deleting a substantial portion of the text disables auto-save</br>
in the buffer; this is the default behavior, because the auto-save</br>
file is usually more useful if it contains the deleted text.
