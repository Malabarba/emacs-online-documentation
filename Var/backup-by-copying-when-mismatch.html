Non-nil means create backups by copying if this preserves owner or group.</br>
Renaming may still be used (subject to control of other variables)</br>
when it would not result in changing the owner or group of the file;</br>
that is, for files which are owned by you and whose group matches</br>
the default for a new file created there by you.</br>
This variable is relevant only if `backup-by-copying' is nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
