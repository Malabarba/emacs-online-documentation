<strong>backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 200<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means create backups by copying to preserve a privileged owner.<br/>
Renaming may still be used (subject to control of other variables)<br/>
when it would not result in changing the owner of the file or if the owner<br/>
has a user id greater than the value of this variable.  This is useful<br/>
when low-numbered uid's are used for special system users (such as root)<br/>
that must maintain ownership of certain files.<br/>
This variable is relevant only if `backup-by-copying' and<br/>
`backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' are nil.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
