List of functions to call before each text change.</br>
Two arguments are passed to each function: the positions of</br>
the beginning and end of the range of old text to be changed.</br>
(For an insertion, the beginning and end are at the same place.)</br>
No information is given about the length of the text after the change.</br>
</br>
Buffer changes made while executing the `before-change-functions'</br>
don't call any before-change or after-change functions.</br>
That's because `inhibit-modification-hooks' is temporarily set non-nil.</br>
</br>
If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,</br>
the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error</br>
from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.
