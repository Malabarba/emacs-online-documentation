bibtex-generate-url-list is a variable defined in `bibtex.el'.<br/>Its value is ((("url" . ".*:.*")))<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of schemes for generating the URL of a BibTeX entry.<br/>These schemes are used by `bibtex-url'.<br/><br/>Each scheme should have one of these forms:<br/><br/>  ((FIELD . REGEXP))<br/>  ((FIELD . REGEXP) STEP...)<br/>  ((FIELD . REGEXP) STRING STEP...)<br/><br/>FIELD is a field name as returned by `bibtex-parse-entry'.<br/>REGEXP is matched against the text of FIELD.  If the match succeeds,<br/>then this scheme is used.  If no STRING and STEPs are specified<br/>the matched text is used as the URL, otherwise the URL is built<br/>by evaluating STEPs.  If no STRING is specified the STEPs must result<br/>in strings which are concatenated.  Otherwise the resulting objects<br/>are passed through `format' using STRING as format control string.<br/><br/>A STEP is a list (FIELD REGEXP REPLACE).  The text of FIELD<br/>is matched against REGEXP, and is replaced with REPLACE.<br/>REPLACE can be a string, or a number (which selects the corresponding<br/>submatch), or a function called with the field's text as argument<br/>and with the `match-data' properly set.<br/><br/>Case is always ignored.  Always remove the field delimiters.<br/>If `bibtex-expand-strings' is non-nil, BibTeX strings are expanded<br/>for generating the URL.<br/>Set this variable before loading BibTeX mode.<br/><br/>The following is a complex example, see URL `http://link.aps.org/'.<br/><br/>   ((("journal" . "\<\(PR[ABCDEL]?\|RMP\)\>")<br/>     "http://link.aps.org/abstract/%s/v%s/p%s"<br/>     ("journal" ".*" upcase)<br/>     ("volume" ".*" 0)<br/>     ("pages" "\`[A-Z]?[0-9]+" 0)))<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
