<strong>bidi-paragraph-direction</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li><li>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value</br>
  satisfies the predicate which is a byte-compiled expression.</br>
</ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, forces directionality of text paragraphs in the buffer.</br>
</br>
If this is nil (the default), the direction of each paragraph is</br>
determined by the first strong directional character of its text.</br>
The values of `right-to-left' and `left-to-right' override that.</br>
Any other value is treated as nil.</br>
</br>
This variable has no effect unless the buffer's value of</br>
`bidi-display-reordering' is non-nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
