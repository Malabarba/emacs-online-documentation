Alist specifying how to blink the cursor off.</br>
Each element has the form (ON-STATE . OFF-STATE).  Whenever the</br>
`cursor-type' frame-parameter or variable equals ON-STATE,</br>
comparing using `equal', Emacs uses OFF-STATE to specify</br>
how to blink it off.  ON-STATE and OFF-STATE are values for</br>
the `cursor-type' frame parameter.</br>
</br>
If a frame's ON-STATE has no entry in this list,</br>
the frame's other specifications determine how to blink the cursor off.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
