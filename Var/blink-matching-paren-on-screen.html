<strong>blink-matching-paren-on-screen</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means show matching open-paren when it is on screen.</br>
If nil, don't show it (but the open-paren can still be shown</br>
when it is off screen).</br>
</br>
This variable has no effect if `blink-matching-paren' is nil.</br>
(In that case, the open-paren is never shown.)</br>
It is also ignored if `show-paren-mode' is enabled.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
