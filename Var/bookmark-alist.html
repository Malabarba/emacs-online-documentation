<strong>bookmark-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Association list of bookmarks and their records.<br/>
Bookmark functions update the value automatically.<br/>
You probably do NOT want to change the value yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The value is an alist with entries of the form<br/>
<br/>
 (BOOKMARK-NAME . PARAM-ALIST)<br/>
<br/>
or the deprecated form (BOOKMARK-NAME PARAM-ALIST).<br/>
<br/>
 BOOKMARK-NAME is the name you gave to the bookmark when creating it.<br/>
<br/>
 PARAM-ALIST is an alist of bookmark information.  The order of the<br/>
 entries in PARAM-ALIST is not important.  The possible entries are<br/>
 described below.  An entry with a key but null value means the entry<br/>
 is not used.<br/>
<br/>
  (filename . FILENAME)<br/>
  (position . POS)<br/>
  (front-context-string . STR-AFTER-POS)<br/>
  (rear-context-string  . STR-BEFORE-POS)<br/>
  (handler . HANDLER)<br/>
  (annotation . ANNOTATION)<br/>
<br/>
 FILENAME names the bookmarked file.<br/>
 POS is the bookmarked buffer position (position in the file).<br/>
 STR-AFTER-POS is buffer text that immediately follows POS.<br/>
 STR-BEFORE-POS is buffer text that immediately precedes POS.<br/>
 ANNOTATION is a string that describes the bookmark.<br/>
   See options `bookmark-use-annotations' and<br/>
   `bookmark-automatically-show-annotations'.<br/>
 HANDLER is a function that provides the bookmark-jump behavior for a<br/>
 specific kind of bookmark.  This is the case for Info bookmarks,<br/>
 for instance.  HANDLER must accept a bookmark as argument.
