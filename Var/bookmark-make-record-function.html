<strong>bookmark-make-record-function</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>bookmark.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>bookmark-make-record-default</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A function that should be called to create a bookmark record.</br>
Modes may set this variable buffer-locally to enable bookmarking of</br>
locations that should be treated specially, such as Info nodes,</br>
news posts, images, pdf documents, etc.</br>
</br>
The function will be called with no arguments.</br>
It should signal a user error if it is unable to construct a record for</br>
the current location.</br>
</br>
The returned record should be a cons cell of the form (NAME . ALIST)</br>
where ALIST is as described in `bookmark-alist' and may typically contain</br>
a special cons (handler . HANDLER-FUNC) which specifies the handler function</br>
that should be used instead of `bookmark-default-handler' to open this</br>
bookmark.  See the documentation for `bookmark-alist' for more.</br>
</br>
NAME is a suggested name for the constructed bookmark.  It can be nil</br>
in which case a default heuristic will be used.  The function can also</br>
equivalently just return ALIST without NAME.
