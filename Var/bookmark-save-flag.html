bookmark-save-flag is a variable defined in `bookmark.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Controls when Emacs saves bookmarks to a file.<br/>--> nil means never save bookmarks, except when `bookmark-save' is<br/>    explicitly called (M-x bookmark-save).<br/>--> t means save bookmarks when Emacs is killed.<br/>--> Otherwise, it should be a number that is the frequency with which<br/>    the bookmark list is saved (i.e.: the number of times which<br/>    Emacs's bookmark list may be modified before it is automatically<br/>    saved.).  If it is a number, Emacs will also automatically save<br/>    bookmarks when it is killed.<br/><br/>Therefore, the way to get it to save every time you make or delete a<br/>bookmark is to set this variable to 1 (or 0, which produces the same<br/>behavior.)<br/><br/>To specify the file in which to save them, modify the variable<br/>`bookmark-default-file', which is `~/.emacs.bmk' by default.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
