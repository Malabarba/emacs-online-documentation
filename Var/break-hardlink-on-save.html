<strong>break-hardlink-on-save</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means when saving a file that exists under several names<br/>
(i.e., has multiple hardlinks), break the hardlink associated with<br/>
`buffer-file-name' and write to a new file, so that the other<br/>
instances of the file are not affected by the save.<br/>
<br/>
If `buffer-file-name' refers to a symlink, do not break the symlink.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike `file-precious-flag', `break-hardlink-on-save' is not advisory.<br/>
For example, if the directory in which a file is being saved is not<br/>
itself writable, then error instead of saving in some<br/>
hardlink-nonbreaking way.<br/>
<br/>
See also `backup-by-copying' and `backup-by-copying-when-linked'.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
