Whether to allow breaking hardlinks when saving files.</br>
If non-nil, then when saving a file that exists under several</br>
names (i.e., has multiple hardlinks), break the hardlink</br>
associated with `buffer-file-name' and write to a new file, so</br>
that the other instances of the file are not affected by the</br>
save.</br>
</br>
If `buffer-file-name' refers to a symlink, do not break the symlink.</br>
</br>
Unlike `file-precious-flag', `break-hardlink-on-save' is not advisory.</br>
For example, if the directory in which a file is being saved is not</br>
itself writable, then error instead of saving in some</br>
hardlink-nonbreaking way.</br>
</br>
See also `backup-by-copying' and `backup-by-copying-when-linked'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
