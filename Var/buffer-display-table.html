<strong>buffer-display-table</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Display table that controls display of the contents of current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is nil, the value of `standard-display-table' is used.<br/>
Each window can have its own, overriding display table, see<br/>
`set-window-display-table' and `window-display-table'.<br/>
<br/>
The display table is a char-table created with `make-display-table'.<br/>
A char-table is an array indexed by character codes.  Normal array<br/>
primitives `aref' and `aset' can be used to access elements of a char-table.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the char-table elements control how to display the corresponding<br/>
text character: the element at index C in the table says how to display<br/>
the character whose code is C.  Each element should be a vector of<br/>
characters or nil.  The value nil means display the character in the<br/>
default fashion; otherwise, the characters from the vector are delivered<br/>
to the screen instead of the original character.<br/>
<br/>
For example, (aset buffer-display-table ?X [?Y]) tells Emacs<br/>
to display a capital Y instead of each X character.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, a char-table has six extra slots to control the display of:<br/>
<br/>
  the end of a truncated screen line (extra-slot 0, a single character);<br/>
  the end of a continued line (extra-slot 1, a single character);<br/>
  the escape character used to display character codes in octal<br/>
    (extra-slot 2, a single character);<br/>
  the character used as an arrow for control characters (extra-slot 3,<br/>
    a single character);<br/>
  the decoration indicating the presence of invisible lines (extra-slot 4,<br/>
    a vector of characters);<br/>
  the character used to draw the border between side-by-side windows<br/>
    (extra-slot 5, a single character).<br/>
