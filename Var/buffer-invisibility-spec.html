Invisibility spec of this buffer.</br>
The default is t, which means that text is invisible if it has a non-nil</br>
`invisible' property.</br>
This variable can also be a list.  The list can have two kinds of elements:</br>
`ATOM' and `(ATOM . ELLIPSIS)'.  A text character is invisible if its</br>
`invisible' property is `ATOM', or has an `invisible' property that is a list</br>
that contains `ATOM'.</br>
If the `(ATOM . ELLIPSIS)' form is used, and `ELLIPSIS' is non-nil, an</br>
ellipsis will be displayed after the invisible characters.</br>
Setting this variable is very fast, much faster than scanning all the text in</br>
the buffer looking for properties to change.
