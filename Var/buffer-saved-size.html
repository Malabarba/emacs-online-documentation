buffer-saved-size is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is 0<br/>Local in buffer *scratch*; global value is the same.<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes permanently buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Length of current buffer when last read in, saved or auto-saved.<br/>0 initially.<br/>-1 means auto-saving turned off until next real save.<br/><br/>If you set this to -2, that means don't turn off auto-saving in this buffer<br/>if its text size shrinks.   If you use `buffer-swap-text' on a buffer,<br/>you probably should set this to -2 in that buffer.
