<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Length of current buffer when last read in, saved or auto-saved.</br>
0 initially.</br>
-1 means auto-saving turned off until next real save.</br>
</br>
If you set this to -2, that means don't turn off auto-saving in this buffer</br>
if its text size shrinks.   If you use `buffer-swap-text' on a buffer,</br>
you probably should set this to -2 in that buffer.
