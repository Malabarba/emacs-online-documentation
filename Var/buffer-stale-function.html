<strong>buffer-stale-function</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Function to check whether a non-file buffer needs reverting.<br/>
This should be a function with one optional argument NOCONFIRM.<br/>
Auto Revert Mode passes t for NOCONFIRM.  The function should return<br/>
non-nil if the buffer should be reverted.  A return value of<br/>
`fast' means that the need for reverting was not checked, but<br/>
that reverting the buffer is fast.  The buffer is current when<br/>
this function is called.<br/>
<br/>
The idea behind the NOCONFIRM argument is that it should be<br/>
non-nil if the buffer is going to be reverted without asking the<br/>
user.  In such situations, one has to be careful with potentially<br/>
time consuming operations.<br/>
