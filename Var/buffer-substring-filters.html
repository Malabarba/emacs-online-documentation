Documentation:<br/>
List of filter functions for `filter-buffer-substring'.<br/>
Each function must accept a single argument, a string, and return<br/>
a string.  The buffer substring is passed to the first function<br/>
in the list, and the return value of each function is passed to<br/>
the next.  The final result (if `buffer-substring-filters' is<br/>
nil, this is the unfiltered buffer-substring) is passed to the<br/>
first function on `filter-buffer-substring-functions'.<br/>
<br/>
As a special convention, point is set to the start of the buffer text<br/>
being operated on (i.e., the first argument of `filter-buffer-substring')<br/>
before these functions are called.
