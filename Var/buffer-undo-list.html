buffer-undo-list is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/>Local in buffer doc-to-html.el; global value is the same.<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes permanently buffer-local when set.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of undo entries in current buffer.<br/>Recent changes come first; older changes follow newer.<br/><br/>An entry (BEG . END) represents an insertion which begins at<br/>position BEG and ends at position END.<br/><br/>An entry (TEXT . POSITION) represents the deletion of the string TEXT<br/>from (abs POSITION).  If POSITION is positive, point was at the front<br/>of the text being deleted; if negative, point was at the end.<br/><br/>An entry (t HIGH LOW USEC PSEC) indicates that the buffer was previously<br/>unmodified; (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC) is in the same style as (current-time)<br/>and is the visited file's modification time, as of that time.  If the<br/>modification time of the most recent save is different, this entry is<br/>obsolete.<br/><br/>An entry (nil PROPERTY VALUE BEG . END) indicates that a text property<br/>was modified between BEG and END.  PROPERTY is the property name,<br/>and VALUE is the old value.<br/><br/>An entry (apply FUN-NAME . ARGS) means undo the change with<br/>(apply FUN-NAME ARGS).<br/><br/>An entry (apply DELTA BEG END FUN-NAME . ARGS) supports selective undo<br/>in the active region.  BEG and END is the range affected by this entry<br/>and DELTA is the number of bytes added or deleted in that range by<br/>this change.<br/><br/>An entry (MARKER . DISTANCE) indicates that the marker MARKER<br/>was adjusted in position by the offset DISTANCE (an integer).<br/><br/>An entry of the form POSITION indicates that point was at the buffer<br/>location given by the integer.  Undoing an entry of this form places<br/>point at POSITION.<br/><br/>Entries with value `nil' mark undo boundaries.  The undo command treats<br/>the changes between two undo boundaries as a single step to be undone.<br/><br/>If the value of the variable is t, undo information is not recorded.
