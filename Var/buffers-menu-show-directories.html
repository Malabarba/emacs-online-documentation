buffers-menu-show-directories is a variable defined in `menu-bar.el'.<br/>Its value is unless-uniquify<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, show directories in the Buffers menu for buffers that have them.<br/>The special value `unless-uniquify' means that directories will be shown<br/>unless `uniquify-buffer-name-style' is non-nil (in which case, buffer<br/>names should include enough of a buffer's directory to distinguish it<br/>from other buffers).<br/><br/>Setting this variable directly does not take effect until next time the<br/>Buffers menu is regenerated.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
