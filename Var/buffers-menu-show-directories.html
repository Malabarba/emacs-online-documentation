<strong>buffers-menu-show-directories</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>menu-bar.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>unless-uniquify</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, show directories in the Buffers menu for buffers that have them.</br>
The special value `unless-uniquify' means that directories will be shown</br>
unless `uniquify-buffer-name-style' is non-nil (in which case, buffer</br>
names should include enough of a buffer's directory to distinguish it</br>
from other buffers).</br>
</br>
Setting this variable directly does not take effect until next time the</br>
Buffers menu is regenerated.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
