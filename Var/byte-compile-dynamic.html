<strong>byte-compile-dynamic</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>
  satisfies the predicate `booleanp'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, compile function bodies so they load lazily.<br/>
They are hidden in comments in the compiled file,<br/>
and each one is brought into core when the<br/>
function is called.<br/>
<br/>
To enable this option, make it a file-local variable<br/>
in the source file you want it to apply to.<br/>
For example, add  -*-byte-compile-dynamic: t;-*- on the first line.<br/>
<br/>
When this option is true, if you load the compiled file and then move it,<br/>
the functions you loaded will not be able to run.
