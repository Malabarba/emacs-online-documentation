<strong>byte-compile-dynamic</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value</br>
  satisfies the predicate `booleanp'.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, compile function bodies so they load lazily.</br>
They are hidden in comments in the compiled file,</br>
and each one is brought into core when the</br>
function is called.</br>
</br>
To enable this option, make it a file-local variable</br>
in the source file you want it to apply to.</br>
For example, add  -*-byte-compile-dynamic: t;-*- on the first line.</br>
</br>
When this option is true, if you load the compiled file and then move it,</br>
the functions you loaded will not be able to run.
