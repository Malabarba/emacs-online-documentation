<strong>byte-compile-function-environment</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>bytecomp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist of functions defined in the file being compiled.<br/>
This is so we can inline them when necessary.<br/>
Each element looks like (FUNCTIONNAME . DEFINITION).  It is<br/>
(FUNCTIONNAME . nil) when a function is redefined as a macro.<br/>
It is (FUNCTIONNAME . t) when all we know is that it was defined,<br/>
and we don't know the definition.  For an autoloaded function, DEFINITION<br/>
has the form (autoload . FILENAME).
