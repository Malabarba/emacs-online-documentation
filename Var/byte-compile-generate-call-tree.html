byte-compile-generate-call-tree is a variable defined in `bytecomp.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means collect call-graph information when compiling.<br/>This records which functions were called and from where.<br/>If the value is t, compilation displays the call graph when it finishes.<br/>If the value is neither t nor nil, compilation asks you whether to display<br/>the graph.<br/><br/>The call tree only lists functions called, not macros used. Those functions<br/>which the byte-code interpreter knows about directly (eq, cons, etc.) are<br/>not reported.<br/><br/>The call tree also lists those functions which are not known to be called<br/>(that is, to which no calls have been compiled).  Functions which can be<br/>invoked interactively are excluded from this list.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
