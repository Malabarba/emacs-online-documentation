<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of warnings that the byte-compiler should issue (t for all).</br>
</br>
Elements of the list may be:</br>
</br>
  free-vars   references to variables not in the current lexical scope.</br>
  unresolved  calls to unknown functions.</br>
  callargs    function calls with args that don't match the definition.</br>
  redefine    function name redefined from a macro to ordinary function or vice</br>
              versa, or redefined to take a different number of arguments.</br>
  obsolete    obsolete variables and functions.</br>
  noruntime   functions that may not be defined at runtime (typically</br>
              defined only under `eval-when-compile').</br>
  cl-functions    calls to runtime functions (as distinguished from macros and</br>
                  aliases) from the old CL package (not the newer cl-lib).</br>
  interactive-only</br>
	      commands that normally shouldn't be called from Lisp code.</br>
  lexical     global/dynamic variables lacking a prefix.</br>
  make-local  calls to make-variable-buffer-local that may be incorrect.</br>
  mapcar      mapcar called for effect.</br>
  constants   let-binding of, or assignment to, constants/nonvariables.</br>
  suspicious  constructs that usually don't do what the coder wanted.</br>
</br>
If the list begins with `not', then the remaining elements specify warnings to</br>
suppress.  For example, (not mapcar) will suppress warnings about mapcar.</br>
