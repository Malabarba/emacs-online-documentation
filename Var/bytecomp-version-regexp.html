Regular expression matching safe to load compiled Lisp files.</br>
When Emacs loads a compiled Lisp file, it reads the first 512 bytes</br>
from the file, and matches them against this regular expression.</br>
When the regular expression matches, the file is considered to be safe</br>
to load.  See also `load-dangerous-libraries'.
