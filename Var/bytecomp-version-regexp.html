Regular expression matching safe to load compiled Lisp files.<br/>
When Emacs loads a compiled Lisp file, it reads the first 512 bytes<br/>
from the file, and matches them against this regular expression.<br/>
When the regular expression matches, the file is considered to be safe<br/>
to load.  See also `load-dangerous-libraries'.
