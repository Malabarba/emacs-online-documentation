*Minimum alignment column for line continuation backslashes.</br>
This is used by the functions that automatically insert or align the</br>
line continuation backslashes in multiline macros.  If any line in the</br>
macro exceeds this column then the next tab stop from that line is</br>
used as alignment column instead.  See also `c-backslash-max-column'.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
