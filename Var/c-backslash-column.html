c-backslash-column is a variable defined in `cc-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is set-from-style<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `integerp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Minimum alignment column for line continuation backslashes.<br/>This is used by the functions that automatically insert or align the<br/>line continuation backslashes in multiline macros.  If any line in the<br/>macro exceeds this column then the next tab stop from that line is<br/>used as alignment column instead.  See also `c-backslash-max-column'.<br/><br/>This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described<br/>above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,<br/>it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and<br/>`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,<br/>the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable<br/>`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
