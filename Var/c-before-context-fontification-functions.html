<strong>c-before-context-fontification-functions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, a list of functions called just before context (or<br/>
other non-change) fontification is done.  Typically they will<br/>
extend the region.<br/>
<br/>
These functions will be run in the order given.  Each of them<br/>
takes 2 parameters, the BEG and END of the region to be<br/>
fontified.  Point is undefined on both entry and exit.  On entry,<br/>
the buffer will have been widened and match-data will have been<br/>
saved; the return value is a cons of the adjusted<br/>
region, (NEW-BEG . NEW-END).
