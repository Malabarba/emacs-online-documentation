If non-nil, a list of functions called just before context (or</br>
other non-change) fontification is done.  Typically they will</br>
extend the region.</br>
</br>
These functions will be run in the order given.  Each of them</br>
takes 2 parameters, the BEG and END of the region to be</br>
fontified.  Point is undefined on both entry and exit.  On entry,</br>
the buffer will have been widened and match-data will have been</br>
saved; the return value is a cons of the adjusted</br>
region, (NEW-BEG . NEW-END).
