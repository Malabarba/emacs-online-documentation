c-before-font-lock-functions is a variable defined in `cc-engine.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, a list of functions called just before font locking.<br/>Typically they will extend the region about to be fontified (see<br/>below) and will set `syntax-table' text properties on the region.<br/><br/>These functions will be run in the order given.  Each of them<br/>takes 3 parameters, the BEG, END, and OLD-LEN supplied to every<br/>after-change function; point is undefined on both entry and exit;<br/>on entry, the buffer will have been widened and match-data will<br/>have been saved; the return value is ignored.<br/><br/>The functions may extend the region to be fontified by setting the<br/>buffer local variables c-new-BEG and c-new-END.<br/><br/>The functions are called even when font locking is disabled.<br/><br/>When the mode is initialized, these functions are called with<br/>parameters (point-min), (point-max) and <buffer size>.
