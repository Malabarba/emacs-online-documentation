If non-nil, a list of functions called just before font locking.</br>
Typically they will extend the region about to be fontified (see</br>
below) and will set `syntax-table' text properties on the region.</br>
</br>
These functions will be run in the order given.  Each of them</br>
takes 3 parameters, the BEG, END, and OLD-LEN supplied to every</br>
after-change function; point is undefined on both entry and exit;</br>
on entry, the buffer will have been widened and match-data will</br>
have been saved; the return value is ignored.</br>
</br>
The functions may extend the region to be fontified by setting the</br>
buffer local variables c-new-BEG and c-new-END.</br>
</br>
The functions are called even when font locking is disabled.</br>
</br>
When the mode is initialized, these functions are called with</br>
parameters (point-min), (point-max) and <buffer size>.
