<strong>c-block-comment-prefix</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is set-from-style<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Specifies the line prefix of continued C-style block comments.<br/>
You should set this variable to the literal string that gets inserted<br/>
at the front of continued block style comment lines.  This should<br/>
either be the empty string, or some characters without preceding<br/>
spaces.  To adjust the alignment under the comment starter, put an<br/>
appropriate value on the `c' syntactic symbol (see the<br/>
`c-offsets-alist' variable).<br/>
<br/>
It's only used when a one-line block comment is broken into two or<br/>
more lines for the first time; otherwise the appropriate prefix is<br/>
adapted from the comment.  This variable is not used for C++ line<br/>
style comments.<br/>
<br/>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described<br/>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,<br/>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and<br/>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,<br/>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable<br/>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
