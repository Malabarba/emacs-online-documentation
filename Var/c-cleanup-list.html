*List of various C/C++/ObjC constructs to "clean up".</br>
The following clean ups only take place when the auto-newline feature</br>
is turned on, as evidenced by the `/la' appearing next to the mode</br>
name:</br>
</br>
 brace-else-brace    -- Clean up "} else {" constructs by placing</br>
                        entire construct on a single line.  This clean</br>
                        up only takes place when there is nothing but</br>
                        white space between the braces and the `else'.</br>
                        Clean up occurs when the open brace after the</br>
                        `else' is typed.</br>
 brace-elseif-brace  -- Similar to brace-else-brace, but clean up</br>
                        "} else if (...) {" constructs.  Clean up</br>
                        occurs after the open parenthesis and the open</br>
                        brace.</br>
 brace-catch-brace   -- Similar to brace-elseif-brace, but clean up</br>
                        "} catch (...) {" constructs.</br>
 empty-defun-braces  -- Clean up empty defun braces by placing the</br>
                        braces on the same line.  Clean up occurs when</br>
                        the defun closing brace is typed.</br>
 one-liner-defun     -- If the code inside a function body can fit in</br>
                        a single line, then remove any newlines</br>
                        between that line and the defun braces so that</br>
                        the whole body becomes a single line.</br>
                        `c-max-one-liner-length' gives the maximum</br>
                        length allowed for the resulting line.  Clean</br>
                        up occurs when the closing brace is typed.</br>
 defun-close-semi    -- Clean up the terminating semi-colon on defuns</br>
                        by placing the semi-colon on the same line as</br>
                        the closing brace.  Clean up occurs when the</br>
                        semi-colon is typed.</br>
 list-close-comma    -- Clean up commas following braces in array</br>
                        and aggregate initializers.  Clean up occurs</br>
                        when the comma is typed.</br>
 scope-operator      -- Clean up double colons which may designate</br>
                        a C++ scope operator split across multiple</br>
                        lines.  Note that certain C++ constructs can</br>
                        generate ambiguous situations.  This clean up</br>
                        only takes place when there is nothing but</br>
                        whitespace between colons.  Clean up occurs</br>
                        when the second colon is typed.</br>
</br>
The following clean ups always take place when they are on this list,</br>
regardless of the auto-newline feature, since they typically don't</br>
involve auto-newline inserted newlines:</br>
</br>
 space-before-funcall -- Insert exactly one space before the opening</br>
                        parenthesis of a function call.  Clean up</br>
                        occurs when the opening parenthesis is typed.</br>
 compact-empty-funcall -- Clean up any space before the function call</br>
                        opening parenthesis if and only if the</br>
                        argument list is empty.  This is typically</br>
                        useful together with `space-before-funcall' to</br>
                        get the style "foo (bar)" and "foo()".</br>
                        Clean up occurs when the closing parenthesis</br>
                        is typed.</br>
 comment-close-slash -- When a slash is typed after the comment prefix</br>
                        on a bare line in a c-style comment, the comment</br>
                        is closed by cleaning up preceding space and</br>
                        inserting a star if needed.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
