<strong>c-comment-only-line-offset</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is set-from-style<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Extra offset for line which contains only the start of a comment.<br/>
Can contain an integer or a cons cell of the form:<br/>
<br/>
 (NON-ANCHORED-OFFSET . ANCHORED-OFFSET)<br/>
<br/>
Where NON-ANCHORED-OFFSET is the amount of offset given to<br/>
non-column-zero anchored comment-only lines, and ANCHORED-OFFSET is<br/>
the amount of offset to give column-zero anchored comment-only lines.<br/>
Just an integer as value is equivalent to (<val> . -1000).<br/>
<br/>
Note that this variable only has effect when the `c-lineup-comment'<br/>
lineup function is used on the `comment-intro' syntactic symbol (the<br/>
default).<br/>
<br/>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described<br/>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,<br/>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and<br/>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,<br/>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable<br/>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
