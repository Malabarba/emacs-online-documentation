*Regexp to match the line prefix inside comments.</br>
This regexp is used to recognize the fill prefix inside comments for</br>
correct paragraph filling and other things.</br>
</br>
If this variable is a string, it will be used in all CC Mode major</br>
modes.  It can also be an association list, to associate specific</br>
regexps to specific major modes.  The symbol for the major mode is</br>
looked up in the association list, and its value is used as the line</br>
prefix regexp.  If it's not found, then the symbol `other' is looked</br>
up and its value is used instead.</br>
</br>
The regexp should match the prefix used in both C++ style line</br>
comments and C style block comments, but it does not need to match a</br>
block comment starter.  In other words, it should at least match</br>
"//" for line comments and the string in `c-block-comment-prefix',</br>
which is sometimes inserted by CC Mode inside block comments.  It</br>
should not match any surrounding whitespace.</br>
</br>
Note that CC Mode uses this variable to set many other variables that</br>
handle the paragraph filling.  That's done at mode initialization or</br>
when you switch to a style which sets this variable.  Thus, if you</br>
change it in some other way, e.g. interactively in a CC Mode buffer,</br>
you will need to do M-x c-setup-paragraph-variables afterwards so that</br>
the other variables are updated with the new value.</br>
</br>
Note also that when CC Mode starts up, all variables are initialized</br>
before the mode hooks are run.  It's therefore necessary to make a</br>
call to `c-setup-paragraph-variables' explicitly if you change this</br>
variable in a mode hook.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
