Documentation:<br/>
Regexp matching the start of any declaration, cast or label.<br/>
It's used on the token after the one `c-decl-prefix-re' matched.  This<br/>
regexp should not try to match those constructs accurately as it's<br/>
only used as a sieve to avoid spending more time checking other<br/>
constructs.
