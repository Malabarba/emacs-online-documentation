Its value is <pre>set-from-style</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Specifies documentation comment style(s) to recognize.</br>
This is primarily used to fontify doc comments and the markup within</br>
them, e.g. Javadoc comments.</br>
</br>
The value can be any of the following symbols for various known doc</br>
comment styles:</br>
</br>
 javadoc -- Javadoc style for "/** ... */" comments (default in Java mode).</br>
 autodoc -- Pike autodoc style for "//! ..." comments (default in Pike mode).</br>
 gtkdoc  -- GtkDoc style for "/** ... **/" comments (default in C mode).</br>
</br>
The value may also be a list of doc comment styles, in which case all</br>
of them are recognized simultaneously (presumably with markup cues</br>
that don't conflict).</br>
</br>
The value may also be an association list to specify different doc</br>
comment styles for different languages.  The symbol for the major mode</br>
is then looked up in the alist, and the value of that element is</br>
interpreted as above if found.  If it isn't found then the symbol</br>
`other' is looked up and its value is used instead.</br>
</br>
Note that CC Mode uses this variable to set other variables that</br>
handle fontification etc.  That's done at mode initialization or when</br>
you switch to a style which sets this variable.  Thus, if you change</br>
it in some other way, e.g. interactively in a CC Mode buffer, you will</br>
need to do M-x java-mode (or whatever mode you're currently using) to</br>
reinitialize.</br>
</br>
Note also that when CC Mode starts up, the other variables are</br>
modified before the mode hooks are run.  If you change this variable</br>
in a mode hook, you have to call `c-setup-doc-comment-style'</br>
afterwards to redo that work.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
