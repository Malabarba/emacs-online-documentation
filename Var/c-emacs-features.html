A list of certain features in the (X)Emacs you are using.</br>
There are many flavors of Emacs out there, each with different</br>
features supporting those needed by CC Mode.  The following values</br>
might be present:</br>
</br>
'8-bit              8 bit syntax entry flags (XEmacs style).</br>
'1-bit              1 bit syntax entry flags (Emacs style).</br>
'argumentative-bod-function         beginning-of-defun passes ARG through</br>
                    to a non-null beginning-of-defun-function.  It is assumed</br>
		    the end-of-defun does the same thing.</br>
'syntax-properties  It works to override the syntax for specific characters</br>
		    in the buffer with the 'syntax-table property.  It's</br>
		    always set - CC Mode no longer works in emacsen without</br>
		    this feature.</br>
'gen-comment-delim  Generic comment delimiters work</br>
		    (i.e. the syntax class `!').</br>
'gen-string-delim   Generic string delimiters work</br>
		    (i.e. the syntax class `|').</br>
'pps-extended-state `parse-partial-sexp' returns a list with at least 10</br>
		    elements, i.e. it contains the position of the start of</br>
		    the last comment or string.  It's always set - CC Mode</br>
                    no longer works in emacsen without this feature.</br>
'posix-char-classes The regexp engine understands POSIX character classes.</br>
'col-0-paren        It's possible to turn off the ad-hoc rule that a paren</br>
		    in column zero is the start of a defun.</br>
'infodock           This is Infodock (based on XEmacs).</br>
</br>
'8-bit and '1-bit are mutually exclusive.
