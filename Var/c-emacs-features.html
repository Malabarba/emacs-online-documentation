c-emacs-features is a variable defined in `cc-defs.el'.<br/>Its value is<br/>(pps-extended-state col-0-paren posix-char-classes gen-string-delim gen-comment-delim syntax-properties 1-bit)<br/><br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A list of certain features in the (X)Emacs you are using.<br/>There are many flavors of Emacs out there, each with different<br/>features supporting those needed by CC Mode.  The following values<br/>might be present:<br/><br/>'8-bit              8 bit syntax entry flags (XEmacs style).<br/>'1-bit              1 bit syntax entry flags (Emacs style).<br/>'argumentative-bod-function         beginning-of-defun passes ARG through<br/>                    to a non-null beginning-of-defun-function.  It is assumed<br/>		    the end-of-defun does the same thing.<br/>'syntax-properties  It works to override the syntax for specific characters<br/>		    in the buffer with the 'syntax-table property.  It's<br/>		    always set - CC Mode no longer works in emacsen without<br/>		    this feature.<br/>'gen-comment-delim  Generic comment delimiters work<br/>		    (i.e. the syntax class `!').<br/>'gen-string-delim   Generic string delimiters work<br/>		    (i.e. the syntax class `|').<br/>'pps-extended-state `parse-partial-sexp' returns a list with at least 10<br/>		    elements, i.e. it contains the position of the start of<br/>		    the last comment or string.  It's always set - CC Mode<br/>                    no longer works in emacsen without this feature.<br/>'posix-char-classes The regexp engine understands POSIX character classes.<br/>'col-0-paren        It's possible to turn off the ad-hoc rule that a paren<br/>		    in column zero is the start of a defun.<br/>'infodock           This is Infodock (based on XEmacs).<br/><br/>'8-bit and '1-bit are mutually exclusive.
