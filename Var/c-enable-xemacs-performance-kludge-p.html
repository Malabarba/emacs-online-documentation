<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Enables a XEmacs only hack that may improve speed for some coding styles.</br>
For styles that hang top-level opening braces (as is common with JDK</br>
Java coding styles) this can improve performance between 3 and 60</br>
times for core indentation functions (e.g. `c-parse-state').  For</br>
styles that conform to the Emacs recommendation of putting these</br>
braces in column zero, this can degrade performance about as much.</br>
This variable only has effect in XEmacs.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
