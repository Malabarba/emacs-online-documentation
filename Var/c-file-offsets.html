Variable interface for setting offsets via File Local Variables.<br/>
In a file's Local Variable section, you can set this variable to an<br/>
association list similar to the values allowed in `c-offsets-alist'.<br/>
When the file is visited, CC Mode will institute these offset settings<br/>
automatically.<br/>

as designated in the variable `c-file-style'.
