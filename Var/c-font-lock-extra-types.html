c-font-lock-extra-types is a variable defined in `cc-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is<br/>("\\sw+_t" "bool" "complex" "imaginary" "FILE" "lconv" "tm" "va_list" "jmp_buf" "Lisp_Object")<br/><br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*List of extra types (aside from the type keywords) to recognize in C mode.<br/>Each list item should be a regexp matching a single identifier.<br/>For example, a value of ("FILE" "\\sw+_t") means the word "FILE"<br/>and words ending in "_t" are treated as type names.<br/><br/>Note that items on this list that don't include any regexp special<br/>characters are automatically optimized using `regexp-opt', so you<br/>should not use `regexp-opt' explicitly to build regexps here.<br/><br/>On decoration level 3 (and higher, where applicable), a method is used<br/>that finds most types and declarations by syntax alone.  This variable<br/>is still used as a first step, but other types are recognized<br/>correctly anyway in most cases.  Therefore this variable should be<br/>fairly restrictive and not contain patterns that are uncertain.<br/><br/>Note that this variable is only consulted when the major mode is<br/>initialized.  If you change it later you have to reinitialize CC Mode<br/>by doing M-x c-mode.<br/><br/>Despite the name, this variable is not only used for font locking but<br/>also elsewhere in CC Mode to tell types from other identifiers.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
