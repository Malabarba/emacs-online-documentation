c-get-state-before-change-functions is a variable defined in `cc-engine.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, a list of functions called from c-before-change-hook.<br/>Typically these will record enough state to allow<br/>`c-before-font-lock-function' to extend the region to fontify,<br/>and may do such things as removing text-properties which must be<br/>recalculated.<br/><br/>These functions will be run in the order given.  Each of them<br/>takes 2 parameters, the BEG and END supplied to every<br/>before-change function; on entry, the buffer will have been<br/>widened and match-data will have been saved; point is undefined<br/>on both entry and exit; the return value is ignored.<br/><br/>The functions are called even when font locking isn't enabled.<br/><br/>When the mode is initialized, the functions are called with<br/>parameters (point-min) and (point-max).
