*Controls the insertion of newlines before and after braces</br>
when the auto-newline feature is active.  This variable contains an</br>
association list with elements of the following form:</br>
(SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL . ACTION).</br>
</br>
When a brace (either opening or closing) is inserted, the syntactic</br>
context it defines is looked up in this list, and if found, the</br>
associated ACTION is used to determine where newlines are inserted.</br>
If the context is not found, the default is to insert a newline both</br>
before and after the brace.</br>
</br>
SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL can be statement-cont, brace-list-intro,</br>
inexpr-class-open, inexpr-class-close, and any of the *-open and</br>
*-close symbols.  See `c-offsets-alist' for details, except for</br>
inexpr-class-open and inexpr-class-close, which doesn't have any</br>
corresponding symbols there.  Those two symbols are used for the</br>
opening and closing braces, respectively, of anonymous inner classes</br>
in Java.</br>
</br>
ACTION can be either a function symbol or a list containing any</br>
combination of the symbols `before' or `after'.  If the list is empty,</br>
no newlines are inserted either before or after the brace.</br>
</br>
When ACTION is a function symbol, the function is called with a two</br>
arguments: the syntactic symbol for the brace and the buffer position</br>
at which the brace was inserted.  The function must return a list as</br>
described in the preceding paragraph.  Note that during the call to</br>
the function, the variable `c-syntactic-context' is set to the entire</br>
syntactic context for the brace line.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
