c-hanging-braces-alist is a variable defined in `cc-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is set-from-style<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Controls the insertion of newlines before and after braces<br/>when the auto-newline feature is active.  This variable contains an<br/>association list with elements of the following form:<br/>(SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL . ACTION).<br/><br/>When a brace (either opening or closing) is inserted, the syntactic<br/>context it defines is looked up in this list, and if found, the<br/>associated ACTION is used to determine where newlines are inserted.<br/>If the context is not found, the default is to insert a newline both<br/>before and after the brace.<br/><br/>SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL can be statement-cont, brace-list-intro,<br/>inexpr-class-open, inexpr-class-close, and any of the *-open and<br/>*-close symbols.  See `c-offsets-alist' for details, except for<br/>inexpr-class-open and inexpr-class-close, which doesn't have any<br/>corresponding symbols there.  Those two symbols are used for the<br/>opening and closing braces, respectively, of anonymous inner classes<br/>in Java.<br/><br/>ACTION can be either a function symbol or a list containing any<br/>combination of the symbols `before' or `after'.  If the list is empty,<br/>no newlines are inserted either before or after the brace.<br/><br/>When ACTION is a function symbol, the function is called with a two<br/>arguments: the syntactic symbol for the brace and the buffer position<br/>at which the brace was inserted.  The function must return a list as<br/>described in the preceding paragraph.  Note that during the call to<br/>the function, the variable `c-syntactic-context' is set to the entire<br/>syntactic context for the brace line.<br/><br/>This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described<br/>above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,<br/>it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and<br/>`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,<br/>the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable<br/>`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
