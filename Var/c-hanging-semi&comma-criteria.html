<strong>c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is set-from-style<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*List of functions that decide whether to insert a newline or not.<br/>
The functions in this list are called, in order, whenever the<br/>
auto-newline minor mode is activated (as evidenced by a `/a' or `/ah'<br/>
string in the mode line), and a semicolon or comma is typed (see<br/>
`c-electric-semi&comma').  Each function in this list is called with<br/>
no arguments, and should return one of the following values:<br/>
<br/>
  nil             -- no determination made, continue checking<br/>
  'stop           -- do not insert a newline, and stop checking<br/>
  (anything else) -- insert a newline, and stop checking<br/>
<br/>
If every function in the list is called with no determination made,<br/>
then no newline is inserted.<br/>
<br/>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described<br/>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,<br/>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and<br/>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,<br/>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable<br/>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
