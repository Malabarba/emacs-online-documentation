Documentation:<br/>
Regexp matching a fully qualified identifier, like "A::B::c" in<br/>
C++.  It does not recognize the full range of syntactic whitespace<br/>
between the tokens; `c-forward-name' has to be used for that.  It<br/>
should also not match identifiers containing parenthesis groupings,<br/>
e.g. identifiers with template arguments such as "A<X,Y>" in C++.
