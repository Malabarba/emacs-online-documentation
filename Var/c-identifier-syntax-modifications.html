Documentation:<br/>
A list that describes the modifications that should be done to the<br/>
mode syntax table to get a syntax table that matches all identifiers<br/>
and keywords as words.<br/>
<br/>
The list is just like the one used in `font-lock-defaults': Each<br/>
element is a cons where the car is the character to modify and the cdr<br/>
the new syntax, as accepted by `modify-syntax-entry'.
