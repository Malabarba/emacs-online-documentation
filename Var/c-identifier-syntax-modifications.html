A list that describes the modifications that should be done to the</br>
mode syntax table to get a syntax table that matches all identifiers</br>
and keywords as words.</br>
</br>
The list is just like the one used in `font-lock-defaults': Each</br>
element is a cons where the car is the character to modify and the cdr</br>
the new syntax, as accepted by `modify-syntax-entry'.
