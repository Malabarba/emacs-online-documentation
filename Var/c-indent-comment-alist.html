Its value is <pre>set-from-style</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Specifies how M-x indent-for-comment calculates the comment start column.</br>
This is an association list that contains entries of the form:</br>
</br>
 (LINE-TYPE . INDENT-SPEC)</br>
</br>
LINE-TYPE specifies a type of line as described below, and INDENT-SPEC</br>
says what M-x indent-for-comment should do when used on that type of line.</br>
</br>
The recognized values for LINE-TYPE are:</br>
</br>
 empty-line        -- The line is empty.</br>
 anchored-comment  -- The line contains a comment that starts in column 0.</br>
 end-block         -- The line contains a solitary block closing brace.</br>
 cpp-end-block     -- The line contains a preprocessor directive that</br>
                      closes a block, i.e. either "#endif" or "#else".</br>
 other             -- The line does not match any other entry</br>
                      currently on the list.</br>
</br>
An INDENT-SPEC is a cons cell of the form:</br>
</br>
 (ACTION . VALUE)</br>
</br>
ACTION says how M-x indent-for-comment should align the comment, and</br>
VALUE is interpreted depending on ACTION.  ACTION can be any of the</br>
following:</br>
</br>
 space   -- Put VALUE spaces between the end of the line and the start</br>
            of the comment.</br>
 column  -- Start the comment at the column VALUE.  If the line is</br>
            longer than that, the comment is preceded by a single</br>
            space.  If VALUE is nil, `comment-column' is used.</br>
 align   -- Align the comment with one on the previous line, if there</br>
            is any.  If the line is too long, the comment is preceded</br>
            by a single space.  If there isn't a comment start on the</br>
            previous line, the behavior is specified by VALUE, which</br>
            in turn is interpreted as an INDENT-SPEC.</br>
</br>
If a LINE-TYPE is missing, then M-x indent-for-comment indents the comment</br>
according to `comment-column'.</br>
</br>
Note that a non-nil value on `c-indent-comments-syntactically-p'</br>
overrides this variable, so empty lines are indented syntactically</br>
in that case, i.e. as if M-x c-indent-command was used instead.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
