<strong>c-indent-comments-syntactically-p</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-vars.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>set-from-style</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Specifies how M-x indent-for-comment should handle comment-only lines.</br>
When this variable is non-nil, comment-only lines are indented</br>
according to syntactic analysis via `c-offsets-alist'.  Otherwise, the</br>
comment is indented as if it was preceded by code.  Note that this</br>
variable does not affect how the normal line indentation treats</br>
comment-only lines.</br>
</br>
This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described</br>
above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,</br>
it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and</br>
`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,</br>
the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable</br>
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
