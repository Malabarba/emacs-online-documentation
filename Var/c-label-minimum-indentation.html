c-label-minimum-indentation is a variable defined in `cc-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is set-from-style<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Minimum indentation for lines inside code blocks.<br/>This variable typically only affects code using the `gnu' style, which<br/>mandates a minimum of one space in front of every line inside code<br/>blocks.  Specifically, the function `c-gnu-impose-minimum' on your<br/>`c-special-indent-hook' is what enforces this.<br/><br/>This is a style variable.  Apart from the valid values described<br/>above, it can be set to the symbol `set-from-style'.  In that case,<br/>it takes its value from the style system (see `c-default-style' and<br/>`c-style-alist') when a CC Mode buffer is initialized.  Otherwise,<br/>the value set here overrides the style system (there is a variable<br/>`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
