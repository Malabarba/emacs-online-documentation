<strong>c-lang-constants-under-evaluation</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-defs.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist of constants in the process of being evaluated.</br>
The `cdr' of each entry indicates how far we've looked in the list</br>
of definitions, so that the def for var FOO in c-mode can be defined in</br>
terms of the def for that same var FOO (which will then rely on the</br>
fallback definition for all modes, to break the cycle).
