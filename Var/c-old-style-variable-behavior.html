<strong>c-old-style-variable-behavior</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>

*Enables the old style variable behavior when non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
Normally the values of the style variables will override the style<br/>
settings specified by the variables `c-default-style' and<br/>
`c-style-alist'.  However, in CC Mode 5.25 and earlier, it was the<br/>
other way around, meaning that changes made to the style variables<br/>
from e.g. Customize would not take effect unless special precautions<br/>
were taken.  That was confusing, especially for novice users.<br/>
<br/>
It's believed that despite this change, the new behavior will still<br/>
produce the same results for most old CC Mode configurations, since<br/>
all style variables are per default set in a special non-override<br/>
state.  Set this variable only if your configuration has stopped<br/>
working due to this change.
