Regexp matching operators that might follow after a type, or nil in</br>
languages that don't have such operators.  The end of the first</br>
submatch is taken as the end of the operator.  This should not match</br>

It's undefined whether identifier syntax (see `c-identifier-syntax-table')</br>
is in effect or not.
