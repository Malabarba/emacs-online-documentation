Non-nil means C++ style template arglists should be handled.  More</br>
specifically, this means a comma separated list of types or</br>
expressions surrounded by "<" and ">".  It's always preceded by an</br>
identifier or one of the keywords on `c-<>-type-kwds' or</br>
`c-<>-arglist-kwds'.  If there's an identifier before then the whole</br>
expression is considered to be a type.
