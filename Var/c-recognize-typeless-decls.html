c-recognize-typeless-decls is a variable defined in `cc-engine.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means function declarations without return type should be<br/>recognized.  That can introduce an ambiguity with parenthesized macro<br/>calls before a brace block.  This setting does not affect declarations<br/>that are preceded by a declaration starting keyword, so<br/>e.g. `c-typeless-decl-kwds' may still be used when it's set to nil.
