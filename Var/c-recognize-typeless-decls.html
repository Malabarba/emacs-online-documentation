Non-nil means function declarations without return type should be</br>
recognized.  That can introduce an ambiguity with parenthesized macro</br>
calls before a brace block.  This setting does not affect declarations</br>
that are preceded by a declaration starting keyword, so</br>
e.g. `c-typeless-decl-kwds' may still be used when it's set to nil.
