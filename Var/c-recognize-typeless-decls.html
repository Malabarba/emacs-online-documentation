<strong>c-recognize-typeless-decls</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means function declarations without return type should be<br/>
recognized.  That can introduce an ambiguity with parenthesized macro<br/>
calls before a brace block.  This setting does not affect declarations<br/>
that are preceded by a declaration starting keyword, so<br/>
e.g. `c-typeless-decl-kwds' may still be used when it's set to nil.
