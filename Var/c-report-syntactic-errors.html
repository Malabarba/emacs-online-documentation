c-report-syntactic-errors is a variable defined in `cc-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*If non-nil, certain syntactic errors are reported with a ding<br/>and a message, for example when an "else" is indented for which<br/>there's no corresponding "if".<br/><br/>Note however that CC Mode doesn't make any special effort to check for<br/>syntactic errors; that's the job of the compiler.  The reason it can<br/>report cases like the one above is that it can't find the correct<br/>anchoring position to indent the line in that case.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
