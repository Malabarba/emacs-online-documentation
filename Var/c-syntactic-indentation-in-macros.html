*Enable syntactic analysis inside macros.<br/>
If this is nil, all lines inside macro definitions are analyzed as<br/>
`cpp-macro-cont'.  Otherwise they are analyzed syntactically, just<br/>
like normal code, and `cpp-define-intro' is used to create the<br/>
additional indentation of the bodies of "#define" macros.<br/>
<br/>
Having this enabled simplifies editing of large multiline macros, but<br/>
it might complicate editing if CC Mode doesn't recognize the context<br/>
of the macro content.  The default context inside the macro is the<br/>
same as the top level, so if it contains "bare" statements they<br/>
might be indented wrongly, although there are special cases that<br/>
handle this in most cases.  If this problem occurs, it's usually<br/>
countered easily by surrounding the statements by a block (or even<br/>
better with the "do { ... } while (0)" trick).<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
