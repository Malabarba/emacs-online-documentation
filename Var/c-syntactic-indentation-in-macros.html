*Enable syntactic analysis inside macros.</br>
If this is nil, all lines inside macro definitions are analyzed as</br>
`cpp-macro-cont'.  Otherwise they are analyzed syntactically, just</br>
like normal code, and `cpp-define-intro' is used to create the</br>
additional indentation of the bodies of "#define" macros.</br>
</br>
Having this enabled simplifies editing of large multiline macros, but</br>
it might complicate editing if CC Mode doesn't recognize the context</br>
of the macro content.  The default context inside the macro is the</br>
same as the top level, so if it contains "bare" statements they</br>
might be indented wrongly, although there are special cases that</br>
handle this in most cases.  If this problem occurs, it's usually</br>
countered easily by surrounding the statements by a block (or even</br>
better with the "do { ... } while (0)" trick).</br>
