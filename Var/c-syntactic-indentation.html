*Whether the indentation should be controlled by the syntactic context.<br/>
<br/>
If t, the indentation functions indent according to the syntactic<br/>
context, using the style settings specified by `c-offsets-alist'.<br/>
<br/>
If nil, every line is just indented to the same level as the previous<br/>
one, and the M-x c-indent-command command adjusts the indentation in<br/>
steps specified by `c-basic-offset'.  The indentation style has no<br/>
effect in this mode, nor any of the indentation associated variables,<br/>
e.g. `c-special-indent-hook'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
