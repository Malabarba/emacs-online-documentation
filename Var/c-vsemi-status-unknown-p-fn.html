Contains a function "are we unsure whether there is a virtual semicolon on this line?".</br>
The (admittedly kludgy) purpose of such a function is to prevent an infinite</br>
recursion in c-beginning-of-statement-1 when point starts at a `while' token.</br>
The function MUST NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES call c-beginning-of-statement-1,</br>
even indirectly.  This variable contains nil for languages which don't have</br>
EOL terminated statements.
