<strong>c-vsemi-status-unknown-p-fn</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-engine.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Contains a function "are we unsure whether there is a virtual semicolon on this line?".<br/>
The (admittedly kludgy) purpose of such a function is to prevent an infinite<br/>
recursion in c-beginning-of-statement-1 when point starts at a `while' token.<br/>
The function MUST NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES call c-beginning-of-statement-1,<br/>
even indirectly.  This variable contains nil for languages which don't have<br/>
EOL terminated statements.
