Non-nil means that Emacs should use caches in attempt to speedup buffer scans.</br>
</br>
There is no reason to set this to nil except for debugging purposes.</br>
</br>
Normally, the line-motion functions work by scanning the buffer for</br>
newlines.  Columnar operations (like `move-to-column' and</br>
`compute-motion') also work by scanning the buffer, summing character</br>
widths as they go.  This works well for ordinary text, but if the</br>
buffer's lines are very long (say, more than 500 characters), these</br>
motion functions will take longer to execute.  Emacs may also take</br>
longer to update the display.</br>
</br>
If `cache-long-scans' is non-nil, these motion functions cache the</br>
results of their scans, and consult the cache to avoid rescanning</br>
regions of the buffer until the text is modified.  The caches are most</br>
beneficial when they prevent the most searching---that is, when the</br>
buffer contains long lines and large regions of characters with the</br>
same, fixed screen width.</br>
</br>
When `cache-long-scans' is non-nil, processing short lines will</br>
become slightly slower (because of the overhead of consulting the</br>
cache), and the caches will use memory roughly proportional to the</br>
number of newlines and characters whose screen width varies.</br>
</br>
Bidirectional editing also requires buffer scans to find paragraph</br>
separators.  If you have large paragraphs or no paragraph separators</br>
at all, these scans may be slow.  If `cache-long-scans' is non-nil,</br>
results of these scans are cached.  This doesn't help too much if</br>
paragraphs are of the reasonable (few thousands of characters) size.</br>
</br>
The caches require no explicit maintenance; their accuracy is</br>
maintained internally by the Emacs primitives.  Enabling or disabling</br>
the cache should not affect the behavior of any of the motion</br>
functions; it should only affect their performance.
