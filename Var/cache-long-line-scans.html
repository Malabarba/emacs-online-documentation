<strong>cache-long-line-scans</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means that Emacs should use caches to handle long lines more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, the line-motion functions work by scanning the buffer for<br/>
newlines.  Columnar operations (like `move-to-column' and<br/>
`compute-motion') also work by scanning the buffer, summing character<br/>
widths as they go.  This works well for ordinary text, but if the<br/>
buffer's lines are very long (say, more than 500 characters), these<br/>
motion functions will take longer to execute.  Emacs may also take<br/>
longer to update the display.<br/>
<br/>
If `cache-long-line-scans' is non-nil, these motion functions cache the<br/>
results of their scans, and consult the cache to avoid rescanning<br/>
regions of the buffer until the text is modified.  The caches are most<br/>
beneficial when they prevent the most searching---that is, when the<br/>
buffer contains long lines and large regions of characters with the<br/>
same, fixed screen width.<br/>
<br/>
When `cache-long-line-scans' is non-nil, processing short lines will<br/>
become slightly slower (because of the overhead of consulting the<br/>
cache), and the caches will use memory roughly proportional to the<br/>
number of newlines and characters whose screen width varies.<br/>
<br/>
The caches require no explicit maintenance; their accuracy is<br/>
maintained internally by the Emacs primitives.  Enabling or disabling<br/>
the cache should not affect the behavior of any of the motion<br/>
functions; it should only affect their performance.
