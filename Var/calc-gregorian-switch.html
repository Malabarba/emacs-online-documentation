<strong>calc-gregorian-switch</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>calc.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The first day the Gregorian calendar is used by Calc's date forms.</br>
This is `nil' (the default) if the Gregorian calendar is the only one used.</br>
Otherwise, it should be a list `(YEAR MONTH DAY)' when Calc begins to use</br>
the Gregorian calendar; Calc will use the Julian calendar for earlier dates.</br>
The dates in which different regions of the world began to use the</br>
Gregorian calendar vary quite a bit, even within a single country.</br>
If you want Calc's date forms to switch between the Julian and</br>
Gregorian calendar, you can specify the date or choose from several</br>
common choices.  Some of these choices should be taken with a grain</br>
of salt; for example different parts of France changed calendars at</br>
different times, and Sweden's change to the Gregorian calendar was</br>
complicated.  Also, the boundaries of the countries were different at</br>
the times of the calendar changes than they are now.</br>
The Vatican decided that the Gregorian calendar should take effect</br>
on 15 October 1582 (Gregorian), and many Catholic countries made</br>
the change then.  Great Britain and its colonies had the Gregorian</br>
calendar take effect on 14 September 1752 (Gregorian); this includes</br>
the United States.</br>
