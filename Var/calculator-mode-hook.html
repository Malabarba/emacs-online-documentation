List of hook functions for `calculator-mode' to run.<br/>
Note: if `calculator-electric-mode' is on, then this hook will get<br/>
activated in the minibuffer - in that case it should not do much more<br/>
than local key settings and other effects that will change things<br/>
outside the scope of calculator related code.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
