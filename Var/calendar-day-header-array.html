<strong>calendar-day-header-array</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>calendar.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>["Su" "Mo" "Tu" "We" "Th" "Fr" "Sa"]</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Array of strings to use for the headers of the calendar's day columns.</br>
The order should be the same as in `calendar-day-name-array'.</br>
In use, the calendar truncates elements to no more than</br>
`calendar-day-header-width' columns wide.</br>
Emacs constructs the default from either `calendar-day-name-array'</br>
(if `calendar-day-header-width' is more than `calendar-abbrev-length'),</br>
or from `calendar-day-abbrev-array' (assuming that the abbreviated</br>
name are more likely to be unique when truncated).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
