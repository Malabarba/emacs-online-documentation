Array of capitalized strings giving the abbreviated month names.</br>
The order should be the same as that of the full names specified</br>
in `calendar-month-name-array'.  These abbreviations are used in</br>
the calendar menu entries, and can also be used in the diary</br>
file.  Do not include a trailing `.' in the strings specified in</br>
this variable, though you may use such in the diary file.  By</br>
default, each string is the first ``calendar-abbrev-length'</br>
characters of the corresponding full name.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
