Functions that may override the normal insertion of a completion choice.</br>
These functions are called in order with three arguments:</br>
CHOICE - the string to insert in the buffer,</br>
BUFFER - the buffer in which the choice should be inserted,</br>
BASE-POSITION - where to insert the completion.</br>
</br>
If a function in the list returns non-nil, that function is supposed</br>
to have inserted the CHOICE in the BUFFER, and possibly exited</br>
the minibuffer; no further functions will be called.</br>
</br>
If all functions in the list return nil, that means to use</br>
the default method of inserting the completion in BUFFER.
