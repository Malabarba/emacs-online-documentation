choose-completion-string-functions is a variable defined in `simple.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Functions that may override the normal insertion of a completion choice.<br/>These functions are called in order with four arguments:<br/>CHOICE - the string to insert in the buffer,<br/>BUFFER - the buffer in which the choice should be inserted,<br/>MINI-P - non-nil if BUFFER is a minibuffer, and<br/>BASE-SIZE - the number of characters in BUFFER before<br/>the string being completed.<br/><br/>If a function in the list returns non-nil, that function is supposed<br/>to have inserted the CHOICE in the BUFFER, and possibly exited<br/>the minibuffer; no further functions will be called.<br/><br/>If all functions in the list return nil, that means to use<br/>the default method of inserting the completion in BUFFER.
