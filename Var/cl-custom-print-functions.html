cl-custom-print-functions is a variable defined in `cl-lib.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>This is a list of functions that format user objects for printing.<br/>Each function is called in turn with three arguments: the object, the<br/>stream, and the print level (currently ignored).  If it is able to<br/>print the object it returns true; otherwise it returns nil and the<br/>printer proceeds to the next function on the list.<br/><br/>This variable is not used at present, but it is defined in hopes that<br/>a future Emacs interpreter will be able to use it.
