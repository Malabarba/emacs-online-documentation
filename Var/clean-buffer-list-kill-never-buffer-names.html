<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of buffer names which will never be killed by `clean-buffer-list'.</br>
See also `clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps'.</br>
Note that this does override `clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps' and</br>
`clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names' so a buffer matching any of these</br>
two lists will NOT be killed if it is also present in this list.</br>

You can customize this variable.
