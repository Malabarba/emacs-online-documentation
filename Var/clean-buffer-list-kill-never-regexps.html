<strong>clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>midnight.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>("^ \\*Minibuf-.*\\*$")</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of regexp saying which buffers will never be killed at midnight.</br>
See also `clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names'.</br>
Killing is done by `clean-buffer-list'.</br>
Note that this does override `clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps' and</br>
`clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names' so a buffer matching any of these</br>
two lists will NOT be killed if it also matches anything in this list.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
