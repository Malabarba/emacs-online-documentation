Documentation:<br/>
Hook run each time a process is exec'd by `comint-exec'.<br/>
This is called after the process is cranked up.  It is useful for things that<br/>
must be done each time a process is executed in a Comint mode buffer (e.g.,<br/>
`(process-kill-without-query)').  In contrast, the `comint-mode-hook' is only<br/>
executed once when the buffer is created.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
