Hook run each time a process is exec'd by `comint-exec'.</br>
This is called after the process is cranked up.  It is useful for things that</br>
must be done each time a process is executed in a Comint mode buffer (e.g.,</br>
`(process-kill-without-query)').  In contrast, the `comint-mode-hook' is only</br>
executed once when the buffer is created.</br>

You can customize this variable.
