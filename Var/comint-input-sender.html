<strong>comint-input-sender</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>comint.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is comint-simple-send<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Function to actually send to PROCESS the STRING submitted by user.<br/>
Usually this is just `comint-simple-send', but if your mode needs to<br/>
massage the input string, put a different function here.<br/>
`comint-simple-send' just sends the string plus a newline.<br/>
(If `comint-input-sender-no-newline' is non-nil, it omits the newline.)<br/>
This is called from the user command `comint-send-input'.
