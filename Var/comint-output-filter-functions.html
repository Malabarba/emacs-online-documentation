Functions to call after output is inserted into the buffer.<br/>
One possible function is `comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom'.<br/>
These functions get one argument, a string containing the text as originally<br/>
inserted.  Note that this might not be the same as the buffer contents between<br/>
`comint-last-output-start' and the buffer's `process-mark', if other filter<br/>
functions have already modified the buffer.<br/>
<br/>

You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list<br/>
either globally or locally.
