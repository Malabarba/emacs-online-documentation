List of functions to call before inserting redirected process output.</br>
Each function gets one argument, a string containing the text received</br>
from the subprocess.  It should return the string to insert, perhaps</br>
the same string that was received, or perhaps a modified or transformed</br>
string.</br>
</br>
The functions on the list are called sequentially, and each one is given</br>
the string returned by the previous one.  The string returned by the</br>
last function is the text that is actually inserted in the redirection buffer.</br>
</br>
You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list</br>
either globally or locally.
