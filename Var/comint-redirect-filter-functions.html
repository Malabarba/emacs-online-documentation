List of functions to call before inserting redirected process output.<br/>
Each function gets one argument, a string containing the text received<br/>
from the subprocess.  It should return the string to insert, perhaps<br/>
the same string that was received, or perhaps a modified or transformed<br/>
string.<br/>
<br/>
The functions on the list are called sequentially, and each one is given<br/>
the string returned by the previous one.  The string returned by the<br/>
last function is the text that is actually inserted in the redirection buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list<br/>
either globally or locally.
