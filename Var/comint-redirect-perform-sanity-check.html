If non-nil, check that redirection is likely to complete successfully.<br/>
More precisely, before starting a redirection, verify that the<br/>
regular expression `comint-redirect-finished-regexp' that controls<br/>
when to terminate it actually matches some text already in the process<br/>
buffer.  The idea is that this regular expression should match a prompt<br/>
string, and that there ought to be at least one copy of your prompt string<br/>
in the process buffer already.
