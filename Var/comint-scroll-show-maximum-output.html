Controls how to scroll due to interpreter output.<br/>
This variable applies when point is at the end of the buffer<br/>
(either because it was originally there, or because<br/>
`comint-move-point-for-output' said to move it there)<br/>
and output from the subprocess is inserted.<br/>
<br/>
Non-nil means scroll so that the window is full of text<br/>
and point is on the last line.  A value of nil<br/>
means don't do anything special--scroll normally.<br/>
<br/>

`comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom'.<br/>
