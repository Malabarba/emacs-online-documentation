How many more comment chars should be inserted by `comment-region'.<br/>
This determines the default value of the numeric argument of `comment-region'.<br/>
The `plain' comment style doubles this value.<br/>
<br/>
This should generally stay 0, except for a few modes like Lisp where<br/>
it is 1 so that regions are commented with two or three semi-colons.
