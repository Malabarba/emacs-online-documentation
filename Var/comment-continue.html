<strong>comment-continue</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Continuation string to insert for multiline comments.</br>
This string will be added at the beginning of each line except the very</br>
first one when commenting a region with a commenting style that allows</br>
comments to span several lines.</br>
It should generally have the same length as `comment-start' in order to</br>
preserve indentation.</br>
If it is nil a value will be automatically derived from `comment-start'</br>
by replacing its first character with a space.
