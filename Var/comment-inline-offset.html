<strong>comment-inline-offset</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>1</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Inline comments have to be preceded by at least this many spaces.</br>
This is useful when style-conventions require a certain minimal offset.</br>
Python's PEP8 for example recommends two spaces, so you could do:</br>
</br>
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook</br>
   (lambda () (set (make-local-variable 'comment-inline-offset) 2)))</br>
</br>
See `comment-padding' for whole-line comments.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
