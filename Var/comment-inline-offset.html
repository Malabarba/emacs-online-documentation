<strong>comment-inline-offset</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 1<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Inline comments have to be preceded by at least this many spaces.<br/>
This is useful when style-conventions require a certain minimal offset.<br/>
Python's PEP8 for example recommends two spaces, so you could do:<br/>
<br/>
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook<br/>
   (lambda () (set (make-local-variable 'comment-inline-offset) 2)))<br/>
<br/>
See `comment-padding' for whole-line comments.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.3 of Emacs.<br/>
