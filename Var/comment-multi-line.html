Non-nil means `comment-indent-new-line' continues comments.</br>
That is, it inserts no new terminator or starter.</br>
This affects `auto-fill-mode', which is the main reason to</br>
customize this variable.</br>
</br>
It also affects C-M-j.  However, if you want this</br>
behavior for explicit filling, you might as well use M-x newline-and-indent.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
