Non-nil means that the global syntactic context is used.</br>
More specifically, it means that `syntax-ppss' is used to find out whether</br>
point is within a string or not.  Major modes whose syntax is not faithfully</br>
described by the syntax-tables (or where `font-lock-syntax-table' is radically</br>
different from the main syntax table) can set this to nil,</br>
then `syntax-ppss' cache won't be used in comment-related routines.
