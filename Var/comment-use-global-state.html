<strong>comment-use-global-state</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
Local in buffer *scratch*; global value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means that the global syntactic context is used.<br/>
More specifically, it means that `syntax-ppss' is used to find out whether<br/>
point is within a string or not.  Major modes whose syntax is faithfully<br/>
described by the syntax-tables can set this to non-nil so comment markers<br/>
in strings will not confuse Emacs.
