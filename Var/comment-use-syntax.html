<strong>comment-use-syntax</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>newcomment.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is undecided<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil if syntax-tables can be used instead of regexps.<br/>
Can also be `undecided' which means that a somewhat expensive test will<br/>
be used to try to determine whether syntax-tables should be trusted<br/>
to understand comments or not in the given buffer.<br/>
Major modes should set this variable.
