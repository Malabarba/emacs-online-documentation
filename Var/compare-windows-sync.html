<strong>compare-windows-sync</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>compare-w.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>compare-windows-sync-default-function</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Function or regexp that is used to synchronize points in two</br>
windows if before calling `compare-windows' points are located</br>
on mismatched positions.</br>
</br>
The value of `compare-windows-sync' can be a function.  The</br>
function's job is to advance points in both windows to the next</br>
matching text.  If the value of `compare-windows-sync' is a</br>
regexp, then points in both windows are advanced to the next</br>
occurrence of this regexp.</br>
</br>
The current default value is the general function</br>
`compare-windows-sync-default-function' that is able to</br>
synchronize points by using quadratic algorithm to find the first</br>
matching 32-character string in two windows.</br>
</br>
The other useful values of this variable could be such functions</br>
as `forward-word', `forward-sentence', `forward-paragraph', or a</br>
regexp containing some field separator or a newline, depending on</br>
the nature of the difference units separator.  The variable can</br>
be made buffer-local.</br>
</br>
If the value of this variable is `nil' (option "No sync"), then</br>
no synchronization is performed, and the function `ding' is called</br>
to beep or flash the screen when points are mismatched.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
