Its value is <pre>"\\(\\s-\\|

</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Regexp or function that defines whitespace sequences for `compare-windows'.</br>
That command optionally ignores changes in whitespace.</br>
</br>
The value of `compare-windows-whitespace' is normally a regexp, but it</br>
can also be a function.  The function's job is to categorize any</br>
whitespace around (including before) point; it should also advance</br>
past any whitespace.  The function is called in each window, with</br>
point at the current scanning point.  It gets one argument, the point</br>
where M-x compare-windows was originally called; it should not look at</br>
any text before that point.</br>
</br>
If the function returns the same value for both windows, then the</br>
whitespace is considered to match, and is skipped.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
