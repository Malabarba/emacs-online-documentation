A list for tracking when directories are entered or left.<br/>
If nil, do not track directories, e.g. if all file names are absolute.  The<br/>
first element is the REGEXP matching these messages.  It can match any number<br/>
of variants, e.g. different languages.  The remaining elements are all of the<br/>
form (DIR .  LEAVE).  If for any one of these the DIR'th subexpression<br/>
matches, that is a directory name.  If LEAVE is nil or the corresponding<br/>
LEAVE'th subexpression doesn't match, this message is about going into another<br/>
directory.  If it does match anything, this message is about going back to the<br/>
directory we were in before the last entering message.  If you change this,<br/>
you may also want to change `compilation-page-delimiter'.
