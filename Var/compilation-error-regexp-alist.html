Alist that specifies how to match errors in compiler output.</br>
On GNU and Unix, any string is a valid filename, so these</br>
matchers must make some common sense assumptions, which catch</br>
normal cases.  A shorter list will be lighter on resource usage.</br>
</br>
Instead of an alist element, you can use a symbol, which is</br>
looked up in `compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist'.  You can see</br>
the predefined symbols and their effects in the file</br>
`etc/compilation.txt' (linked below if you are customizing this).</br>
</br>
Each elt has the form (REGEXP FILE [LINE COLUMN TYPE HYPERLINK</br>
HIGHLIGHT...]).  If REGEXP matches, the FILE'th subexpression</br>
gives the file name, and the LINE'th subexpression gives the line</br>
number.  The COLUMN'th subexpression gives the column number on</br>
that line.</br>
</br>
If FILE, LINE or COLUMN are nil or that index didn't match, that</br>
information is not present on the matched line.  In that case the</br>
file name is assumed to be the same as the previous one in the</br>
buffer, line number defaults to 1 and column defaults to</br>
beginning of line's indentation.</br>
</br>
FILE can also have the form (FILE FORMAT...), where the FORMATs</br>
(e.g. "%s.c") will be applied in turn to the recognized file</br>
name, until a file of that name is found.  Or FILE can also be a</br>
function that returns (FILENAME) or (RELATIVE-FILENAME . DIRNAME).</br>
In the former case, FILENAME may be relative or absolute.</br>
</br>
LINE can also be of the form (LINE . END-LINE) meaning a range</br>
of lines.  COLUMN can also be of the form (COLUMN . END-COLUMN)</br>
meaning a range of columns starting on LINE and ending on</br>
END-LINE, if that matched.</br>
</br>
TYPE is 2 or nil for a real error or 1 for warning or 0 for info.</br>
TYPE can also be of the form (WARNING . INFO).  In that case this</br>
will be equivalent to 1 if the WARNING'th subexpression matched</br>
or else equivalent to 0 if the INFO'th subexpression matched.</br>
See `compilation-error-face', `compilation-warning-face',</br>
`compilation-info-face' and `compilation-skip-threshold'.</br>
</br>
What matched the HYPERLINK'th subexpression has `mouse-face' and</br>
`compilation-message-face' applied.  If this is nil, the text</br>
matched by the whole REGEXP becomes the hyperlink.</br>
</br>
Additional HIGHLIGHTs take the shape (SUBMATCH FACE), where</br>
SUBMATCH is the number of a submatch and FACE is an expression</br>
which evaluates to a face name (a symbol or string).</br>
Alternatively, FACE can evaluate to a property list of the</br>
form (face FACE PROP1 VAL1 PROP2 VAL2 ...), in which case all the</br>
listed text properties PROP# are given values VAL# as well.</br>
</br>
