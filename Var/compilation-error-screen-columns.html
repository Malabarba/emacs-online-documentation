<strong>compilation-error-screen-columns</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>compile.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, column numbers in error messages are screen columns.<br/>
Otherwise they are interpreted as character positions, with<br/>
each character occupying one column.<br/>
The default is to use screen columns, which requires that the compilation<br/>
program and Emacs agree about the display width of the characters,<br/>
especially the TAB character.<br/>
If this is buffer-local in the destination buffer, Emacs obeys<br/>
that value, otherwise it uses the value in the *compilation*<br/>
buffer.  This enables a major-mode to specify its own value.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 20.4 of Emacs.<br/>
