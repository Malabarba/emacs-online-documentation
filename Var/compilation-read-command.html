<strong>compilation-read-command</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>compile.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means M-x compile reads the compilation command to use.</br>
Otherwise, M-x compile just uses the value of `compile-command'.</br>
</br>
Note that changing this to nil may be a security risk, because a</br>
file might define a malicious `compile-command' as a file local</br>
variable, and you might not notice.  Therefore, `compile-command'</br>
is considered unsafe if this variable is nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
