Its value is <pre>(tags-completion-at-point-function)</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Special hook to find the completion table for the thing at point.</br>
Each function on this hook is called in turns without any argument and should</br>
return either nil to mean that it is not applicable at point,</br>
or a function of no argument to perform completion (discouraged),</br>
or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS) where</br>
 START and END delimit the entity to complete and should include point,</br>
 COLLECTION is the completion table to use to complete it, and</br>
 PROPS is a property list for additional information.</br>
Currently supported properties are all the properties that can appear in</br>
`completion-extra-properties' plus:</br>
 `:predicate'	a predicate that completion candidates need to satisfy.</br>
 `:exclusive'	If `no', means that if the completion table fails to</br>
   match the text at point, then instead of reporting a completion</br>
   failure, the completion should try the next completion function.</br>
As is the case with most hooks, the functions are responsible to preserve</br>
things like point and current buffer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
