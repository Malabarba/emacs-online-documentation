completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in `minibuffer.el'.<br/>Its value is (lisp-completion-at-point t)<br/>Local in buffer doc-to-html.el; global value is <br/>(tags-completion-at-point-function)<br/><br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Special hook to find the completion table for the thing at point.<br/>Each function on this hook is called in turns without any argument and should<br/>return either nil to mean that it is not applicable at point,<br/>or a function of no argument to perform completion (discouraged),<br/>or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS) where<br/> START and END delimit the entity to complete and should include point,<br/> COLLECTION is the completion table to use to complete it, and<br/> PROPS is a property list for additional information.<br/>Currently supported properties are all the properties that can appear in<br/>`completion-extra-properties' plus:<br/> `:predicate'	a predicate that completion candidates need to satisfy.<br/> `:exclusive'	If `no', means that if the completion table fails to<br/>   match the text at point, then instead of reporting a completion<br/>   failure, the completion should try the next completion function.<br/>As is the case with most hooks, the functions are responsible to preserve<br/>things like point and current buffer.
