Number of chars before point not involved in completion.</br>
This is a local variable in the completion list buffer.</br>
It refers to the chars in the minibuffer if completing in the</br>
minibuffer, or in `completion-reference-buffer' otherwise.</br>
Only characters in the field at point are included.</br>
</br>
If nil, Emacs determines which part of the tail end of the</br>
buffer's text is involved in completion by comparing the text</br>
directly.
