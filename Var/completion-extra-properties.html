Property list of extra properties of the current completion job.</br>
These include:</br>
</br>
`:annotation-function': Function to annotate the completions buffer.</br>
   The function must accept one argument, a completion string,</br>
   and return either nil or a string which is to be displayed</br>
   next to the completion (but which is not part of the</br>
   completion).  The function can access the completion data via</br>
   `minibuffer-completion-table' and related variables.</br>
</br>
`:exit-function': Function to run after completion is performed.</br>
</br>
   The function must accept two arguments, STRING and STATUS.</br>
   STRING is the text to which the field was completed, and</br>
   STATUS indicates what kind of operation happened:</br>
     `finished' - text is now complete</br>
     `sole'     - text cannot be further completed but</br>
                  completion is not finished</br>
     `exact'    - text is a valid completion but may be further</br>
                  completed.
