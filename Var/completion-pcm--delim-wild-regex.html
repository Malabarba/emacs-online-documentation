Documentation:<br/>
Regular expression matching delimiters controlling the partial-completion.<br/>
Typically, this regular expression simply matches a delimiter, meaning<br/>
that completion can add something at (match-beginning 0), but if it has<br/>
a submatch 1, then completion can add something at (match-end 1).<br/>
This is used when the delimiter needs to be of size zero (e.g. the transition<br/>
from lowercase to uppercase characters).
