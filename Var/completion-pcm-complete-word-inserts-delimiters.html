<strong>completion-pcm-complete-word-inserts-delimiters</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Treat the SPC or - inserted by `minibuffer-complete-word' as delimiters.</br>
Those chars are treated as delimiters if this variable is non-nil.</br>
I.e. if non-nil, M-x SPC will just insert a "-" in the minibuffer, whereas</br>
if nil, it will list all possible commands in *Completions* because none of</br>
the commands start with a "-" or a SPC.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
