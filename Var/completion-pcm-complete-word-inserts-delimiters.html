<strong>completion-pcm-complete-word-inserts-delimiters</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Treat the SPC or - inserted by `minibuffer-complete-word' as delimiters.<br/>
Those chars are treated as delimiters iff this variable is non-nil.<br/>
I.e. if non-nil, M-x SPC will just insert a "-" in the minibuffer, whereas<br/>
if nil, it will list all possible commands in *Completions* because none of<br/>
the commands start with a "-" or a SPC.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
