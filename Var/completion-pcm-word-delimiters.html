<strong>completion-pcm-word-delimiters</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "-_./:| "<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
A string of characters treated as word delimiters for completion.<br/>
Some arcane rules:<br/>
If `]' is in this string, it must come first.<br/>
If `^' is in this string, it must not come first.<br/>
If `-' is in this string, it must come first or right after `]'.<br/>
In other words, if S is this string, then `[S]' must be a valid Emacs regular<br/>
expression (not containing character ranges like `a-z').<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
