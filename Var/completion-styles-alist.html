List of available completion styles.</br>
Each element has the form (NAME TRY-COMPLETION ALL-COMPLETIONS DOC):</br>
where NAME is the name that should be used in `completion-styles',</br>
TRY-COMPLETION is the function that does the completion (it should</br>
follow the same calling convention as `completion-try-completion'),</br>
ALL-COMPLETIONS is the function that lists the completions (it should</br>
follow the calling convention of `completion-all-completions'),</br>
and DOC describes the way this style of completion works.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
