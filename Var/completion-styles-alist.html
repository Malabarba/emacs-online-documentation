Documentation:<br/>
List of available completion styles.<br/>
Each element has the form (NAME TRY-COMPLETION ALL-COMPLETIONS DOC):<br/>
where NAME is the name that should be used in `completion-styles',<br/>
TRY-COMPLETION is the function that does the completion (it should<br/>
follow the same calling convention as `completion-try-completion'),<br/>
ALL-COMPLETIONS is the function that lists the completions (it should<br/>
follow the calling convention of `completion-all-completions'),<br/>
and DOC describes the way this style of completion works.
