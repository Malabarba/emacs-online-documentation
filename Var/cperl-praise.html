Advantages of CPerl mode.</br>
</br>
0) It uses the newest `syntax-table' property ;-);</br>
</br>
1) It does 99% of Perl syntax correct (as opposed to 80-90% in Perl</br>
mode - but the latter number may have improved too in last years) even</br>
with old Emaxen which do not support `syntax-table' property.</br>
</br>
When using `syntax-table' property for syntax assist hints, it should</br>
handle 99.995% of lines correct - or somesuch.  It automatically</br>
updates syntax assist hints when you edit your script.</br>
</br>
2) It is generally believed to be "the most user-friendly Emacs</br>
package" whatever it may mean (I doubt that the people who say similar</br>
things tried _all_ the rest of Emacs ;-), but this was not a lonely</br>
voice);</br>
</br>
3) Everything is customizable, one-by-one or in a big sweep;</br>
</br>
4) It has many easily-accessible "tools":</br>
        a) Can run program, check syntax, start debugger;</br>
        b) Can lineup vertically "middles" of rows, like `=' in</br>
                a  = b;</br>
                cc = d;</br>
        c) Can insert spaces where this improves readability (in one</br>
                interactive sweep over the buffer);</br>
        d) Has support for imenu, including:</br>
                1) Separate unordered list of "interesting places";</br>
                2) Separate TOC of POD sections;</br>
                3) Separate list of packages;</br>
                4) Hierarchical view of methods in (sub)packages;</br>
                5) and functions (by the full name - with package);</br>
        e) Has an interface to INFO docs for Perl; The interface is</br>
                very flexible, including shrink-wrapping of</br>
                documentation buffer/frame;</br>
        f) Has a builtin list of one-line explanations for perl constructs.</br>
        g) Can show these explanations if you stay long enough at the</br>
                corresponding place (or on demand);</br>
        h) Has an enhanced fontification (using 3 or 4 additional faces</br>
                comparing to font-lock - basically, different</br>
                namespaces in Perl have different colors);</br>
        i) Can construct TAGS basing on its knowledge of Perl syntax,</br>
                the standard menu has 6 different way to generate</br>
                TAGS (if "by directory", .xs files - with C-language</br>
                bindings - are included in the scan);</br>
        j) Can build a hierarchical view of classes (via imenu) basing</br>
                on generated TAGS file;</br>
        k) Has electric parentheses, electric newlines, uses Abbrev</br>
                for electric logical constructs</br>
                        while () {}</br>
                with different styles of expansion (context sensitive</br>
                to be not so bothering).  Electric parentheses behave</br>
                "as they should" in a presence of a visible region.</br>
        l) Changes msb.el "on the fly" to insert a group "Perl files";</br>
        m) Can convert from</br>
		if (A) { B }</br>
	   to</br>
		B if A;</br>
</br>
        n) Highlights (by user-choice) either 3-delimiters constructs</br>
	   (such as tr/a/b/), or regular expressions and `y/tr';</br>
	o) Highlights trailing whitespace;</br>
	p) Is able to manipulate Perl Regular Expressions to ease</br>
	   conversion to a more readable form.</br>
        q) Can ispell POD sections and HERE-DOCs.</br>
	r) Understands comments and character classes inside regular</br>
	   expressions; can find matching () and [] in a regular expression.</br>
	s) Allows indentation of //x-style regular expressions;</br>
	t) Highlights different symbols in regular expressions according</br>
	   to their function; much less problems with backslashitis;</br>
	u) Allows to find regular expressions which contain interpolated parts.</br>
</br>
5) The indentation engine was very smart, but most of tricks may be</br>
not needed anymore with the support for `syntax-table' property.  Has</br>
progress indicator for indentation (with `imenu' loaded).</br>
</br>
6) Indent-region improves inline-comments as well; also corrects</br>
whitespace *inside* the conditional/loop constructs.</br>
</br>
7) Fill-paragraph correctly handles multi-line comments;</br>
</br>
8) Can switch to different indentation styles by one command, and restore</br>
the settings present before the switch.</br>
</br>
9) When doing indentation of control constructs, may correct</br>
line-breaks/spacing between elements of the construct.</br>
</br>
10) Uses a linear-time algorithm for indentation of regions (on Emaxen with</br>
capable syntax engines).</br>
</br>
11) Syntax-highlight, indentation, sexp-recognition inside regular expressions.</br>
