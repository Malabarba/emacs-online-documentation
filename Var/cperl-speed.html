cperl-speed is a variable defined in `cperl-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is please-ignore-this-line<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>This is an incomplete compendium of what is available in other parts<br/>of CPerl documentation.  (Please inform me if I skept anything.)<br/><br/>There is a perception that CPerl is slower than alternatives.  This part<br/>of documentation is designed to overcome this misconception.<br/><br/>*By default* CPerl tries to enable the most comfortable settings.<br/>From most points of view, correctly working package is infinitely more<br/>comfortable than a non-correctly working one, thus by default CPerl<br/>prefers correctness over speed.  Below is the guide how to change<br/>settings if your preferences are different.<br/><br/>A)  Speed of loading the file.  When loading file, CPerl may perform a<br/>scan which indicates places which cannot be parsed by primitive Emacs<br/>syntax-parsing routines, and marks them up so that either<br/><br/>    A1) CPerl may work around these deficiencies (for big chunks, mostly<br/>        PODs and HERE-documents), or<br/>    A2) On capable Emaxen CPerl will use improved syntax-handling<br/>	which reads mark-up hints directly.<br/><br/>    The scan in case A2 is much more comprehensive, thus may be slower.<br/><br/>    User can disable syntax-engine-helping scan of A2 by setting<br/>       `cperl-use-syntax-table-text-property'<br/>    variable to nil (if it is set to t).<br/><br/>    One can disable the scan altogether (both A1 and A2) by setting<br/>       `cperl-pod-here-scan'<br/>    to nil.<br/><br/>B) Speed of editing operations.<br/><br/>    One can add a (minor) speedup to editing operations by setting<br/>       `cperl-use-syntax-table-text-property'<br/>    variable to nil (if it is set to t).  This will disable<br/>    syntax-engine-helping scan, thus will make many more Perl<br/>    constructs be wrongly recognized by CPerl, thus may lead to<br/>    wrongly matched parentheses, wrong indentation, etc.<br/><br/>    One can unset `cperl-syntaxify-unwind'.  This might speed up editing<br/>    of, say, long POD sections.
