Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, automatically tabify after rectangle commands.<br/>
This basically means that `tabify' is applied to all lines that<br/>
are modified by inserting or deleting a rectangle.  If value is<br/>
an integer, CUA will look for existing tabs in a region around<br/>
the rectangle, and only do the conversion if any tabs are already<br/>
present.  The number specifies then number of characters before<br/>
and after the region marked by the rectangle to search.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
