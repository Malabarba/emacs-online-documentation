<strong>cua-highlight-region-shift-only</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cua-base.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, only highlight region if marked with S-<move>.<br/>
When this is non-nil, CUA toggles `transient-mark-mode' on when the region<br/>
is marked using shifted movement keys, and off when the mark is cleared.<br/>
But when the mark was set using M-x cua-set-mark, Transient Mark mode<br/>
is not turned on.<br/>
