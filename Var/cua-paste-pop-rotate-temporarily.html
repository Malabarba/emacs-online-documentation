<strong>cua-paste-pop-rotate-temporarily</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cua-base.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, M-x cua-paste-pop only rotates the kill-ring temporarily.<br/>
This means that both C-y and the first M-y in a sequence always insert<br/>
the most recently killed text.  Each immediately following M-x cua-paste-pop replaces<br/>
the previous text with the next older element on the `kill-ring'.<br/>
With prefix arg, C-u M-y inserts the same text as the most<br/>
recent M-y (or C-y) command.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
