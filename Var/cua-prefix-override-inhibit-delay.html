<strong>cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cua-base.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 0.2<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, time in seconds to delay before overriding prefix key.<br/>
If there is additional input within this time, the prefix key is<br/>
used as a normal prefix key.  So typing a key sequence quickly will<br/>
inhibit overriding the prefix key.<br/>
As a special case, if the prefix keys repeated within this time, the<br/>
first prefix key is discarded, so typing a prefix key twice in quick<br/>
succession will also inhibit overriding the prefix key.<br/>
If the value is nil, use a shifted prefix key to inhibit the override.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
