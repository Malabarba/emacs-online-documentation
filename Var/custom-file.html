custom-file is a variable defined in `cus-edit.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>File used for storing customization information.<br/>The default is nil, which means to use your init file<br/>as specified by `user-init-file'.  If the value is not nil,<br/>it should be an absolute file name.<br/><br/>You can set this option through Custom, if you carefully read the<br/>last paragraph below.  However, usually it is simpler to write<br/>something like the following in your init file:<br/><br/>(setq custom-file "~/.emacs-custom.el")<br/>(load custom-file)<br/><br/>Note that both lines are necessary: the first line tells Custom to<br/>save all customizations in this file, but does not load it.<br/><br/>When you change this variable outside Custom, look in the<br/>previous custom file (usually your init file) for the<br/>forms `(custom-set-variables ...)'  and `(custom-set-faces ...)',<br/>and copy them (whichever ones you find) to the new custom file.<br/>This will preserve your existing customizations.<br/><br/>If you save this option using Custom, Custom will write all<br/>currently saved customizations, including the new one for this<br/>option itself, into the file you specify, overwriting any<br/>`custom-set-variables' and `custom-set-faces' forms already<br/>present in that file.  It will not delete any customizations from<br/>the old custom file.  You should do that manually if that is what you<br/>want.  You also have to put something like `(load "CUSTOM-FILE")<br/>in your init file, where CUSTOM-FILE is the actual name of the<br/>file.  Otherwise, Emacs will not load the file when it starts up,<br/>and hence will not set `custom-file' to that file either.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
