Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
File used for storing customization information.</br>
The default is nil, which means to use your init file</br>
as specified by `user-init-file'.  If the value is not nil,</br>
it should be an absolute file name.</br>
</br>
You can set this option through Custom, if you carefully read the</br>
last paragraph below.  However, usually it is simpler to write</br>
something like the following in your init file:</br>
</br>
(setq custom-file "~/.emacs-custom.el")</br>
(load custom-file)</br>
</br>
Note that both lines are necessary: the first line tells Custom to</br>
save all customizations in this file, but does not load it.</br>
</br>
When you change this variable outside Custom, look in the</br>
previous custom file (usually your init file) for the</br>
forms `(custom-set-variables ...)'  and `(custom-set-faces ...)',</br>
and copy them (whichever ones you find) to the new custom file.</br>
This will preserve your existing customizations.</br>
</br>
If you save this option using Custom, Custom will write all</br>
currently saved customizations, including the new one for this</br>
option itself, into the file you specify, overwriting any</br>
`custom-set-variables' and `custom-set-faces' forms already</br>
present in that file.  It will not delete any customizations from</br>
the old custom file.  You should do that manually if that is what you</br>
want.  You also have to put something like `(load "CUSTOM-FILE")</br>
in your init file, where CUSTOM-FILE is the actual name of the</br>
file.  Otherwise, Emacs will not load the file when it starts up,</br>
and hence will not set `custom-file' to that file either.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
