Default user directory for storing custom theme files.</br>
The command `customize-create-theme' writes theme files into this</br>
directory.  By default, Emacs searches for custom themes in this</br>
directory first---see `custom-theme-load-path'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
