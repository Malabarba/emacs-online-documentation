List of directories to search for custom theme files.</br>
When loading custom themes (e.g. in `customize-themes' and</br>
`load-theme'), Emacs searches for theme files in the specified</br>
order.  Each element in the list should be one of the following:</br>
- the symbol `custom-theme-directory', meaning the value of</br>
  `custom-theme-directory'.</br>
- the symbol t, meaning the built-in theme directory (a directory</br>
  named "themes" in `data-directory').</br>
- a directory name (a string).</br>
</br>
Each theme file is named THEME-theme.el, where THEME is the theme</br>
name.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
