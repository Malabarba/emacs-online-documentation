Alist mapping versions of a package to Emacs versions.</br>
We use this for packages that have their own names, but are released</br>
as part of Emacs itself.</br>
</br>
Each elements looks like this:</br>
</br>
     (PACKAGE (PVERSION . EVERSION)...)</br>
</br>
Here PACKAGE is the name of a package, as a symbol.  After</br>
PACKAGE come one or more elements, each associating a</br>
package version PVERSION with the first Emacs version</br>
EVERSION in which it (or a subsequent version of PACKAGE)</br>
was first released.  Both PVERSION and EVERSION are strings.</br>
PVERSION should be a string that this package used in</br>
the :package-version keyword for `defcustom', `defgroup',</br>
and `defface'.</br>
</br>
For example, the MH-E package updates this alist as follows:</br>
</br>
     (add-to-list 'customize-package-emacs-version-alist</br>
                  '(MH-E ("6.0" . "22.1") ("6.1" . "22.1")</br>
                         ("7.0" . "22.1") ("7.1" . "22.1")</br>
                         ("7.2" . "22.1") ("7.3" . "22.1")</br>
                         ("7.4" . "22.1") ("8.0" . "22.1")))</br>
</br>
The value of PACKAGE needs to be unique and it needs to match the</br>
PACKAGE value appearing in the :package-version keyword.  Since</br>
the user might see the value in a error message, a good choice is</br>
the official name of the package, such as MH-E or Gnus.</br>
