<strong>cvs-allow-dir-commit</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>pcvs-info.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Allow `cvs-mode-commit' on directories.<br/>
If you commit without any marked file and with the cursor positioned<br/>
on a directory entry, cvs would commit the whole directory.  This seems<br/>
to confuse some users sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
