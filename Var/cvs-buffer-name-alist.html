This is a list of elements of the form<br/>
<br/>
	(CMD BUFNAME MODE &optional POSTPROC)<br/>
<br/>
CMD is the name of the command.<br/>
BUFNAME is an expression that should evaluate to a string used as<br/>
  a buffer name.  It can use the variable CMD if it wants to.<br/>
MODE is the command to use to setup the buffer.<br/>
POSTPROC is a function that should be executed when the command terminates<br/>
<br/>
The CMD used for `cvs-mode-commit' is "message".  For that special<br/>
  case, POSTPROC is called just after MODE with special arguments.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
