Specifies where the (current) cvs master repository is.</br>
Overrides the environment variable $CVSROOT by sending " -d dir" to</br>
all CVS commands. This switch is useful if you have multiple CVS</br>
repositories. It can be set interactively with M-x cvs-change-cvsroot.</br>
There is no need to set this if $CVSROOT is set to a correct value.
