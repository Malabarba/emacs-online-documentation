cvs-execute-single-dir is a variable defined in `pcvs-defs.el'.<br/>Its value is ("status")<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Whether cvs commands should be executed a directory at a time.<br/>If a list, specifies for which commands the single-dir mode should be used.<br/>If T, single-dir mode should be used for all operations.<br/><br/>CVS versions before 1.10 did not allow passing them arguments in different<br/>directories, so pcl-cvs checks what version you're using to determine<br/>whether to use the new feature or not.<br/>Sadly, even with a new cvs executable, if you connect to an older cvs server<br/>(typically a cvs-1.9 on the server), the old restriction applies.  In such<br/>a case the sanity check made by pcl-cvs fails and you will have to manually<br/>set this variable to t (until the cvs server is upgraded).<br/>When the above problem occurs, pcl-cvs should (hopefully) catch cvs' error<br/>message and replace it with a message telling you to change this variable.
