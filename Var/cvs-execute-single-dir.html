<strong>cvs-execute-single-dir</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>pcvs-defs.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>("status")</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Whether cvs commands should be executed a directory at a time.</br>
If a list, specifies for which commands the single-dir mode should be used.</br>
If t, single-dir mode should be used for all operations.</br>
</br>
CVS versions before 1.10 did not allow passing them arguments in different</br>
directories, so PCL-CVS checks what version you're using to determine</br>
whether to use the new feature or not.</br>
Sadly, even with a new cvs executable, if you connect to an older cvs server</br>
(typically a cvs-1.9 on the server), the old restriction applies.  In such</br>
a case the sanity check made by PCL-CVS fails and you will have to manually</br>
set this variable to t (until the cvs server is upgraded).</br>
When the above problem occurs, PCL-CVS should (hopefully) catch cvs' error</br>
message and replace it with a message telling you to change this variable.
