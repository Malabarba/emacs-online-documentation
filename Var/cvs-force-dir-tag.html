If non-nil, tagging can only be applied to directories.</br>
Tagging should generally be applied a directory at a time, but sometimes it is</br>
useful to be able to tag a single file.  The normal way to do that is to use</br>
`cvs-mode-force-command' so as to temporarily override the restrictions,</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
