If non-nil, tagging can only be applied to directories.<br/>
Tagging should generally be applied a directory at a time, but sometimes it is<br/>
useful to be able to tag a single file.  The normal way to do that is to use<br/>
`cvs-mode-force-command' so as to temporarily override the restrictions,<br/>
