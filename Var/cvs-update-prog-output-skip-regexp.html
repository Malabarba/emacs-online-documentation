<strong>cvs-update-prog-output-skip-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>pcvs-parse.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"$"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A regexp that matches the end of the output from all cvs update programs.</br>
That is, output from any programs that are run by CVS (by the flag -u</br>
in the `modules' file - see cvs(5)) when `cvs update' is performed should</br>
terminate with a line that this regexp matches.  It is enough that</br>
some part of the line is matched.</br>
</br>
The default (a single $) fits programs without output.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
