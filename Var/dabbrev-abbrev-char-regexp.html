<strong>dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>dabbrev.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp to recognize a character in an abbreviation or expansion.<br/>
This regexp will be surrounded with \\( ... \\) when actually used.<br/>
<br/>
Set this variable to "\\sw" if you want ordinary words or<br/>
"\\sw\\|\\s_" if you want symbols (including characters whose<br/>
syntax is "symbol" as well as those whose syntax is "word".<br/>
<br/>
The value nil has a special meaning: the abbreviation is from point to<br/>
previous word-start, but the search is for symbols.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if you are programming in Lisp, `yes-or-no-p' is a symbol,<br/>
while `yes', `or', `no' and `p' are considered words.  If this<br/>
variable is nil, then expanding `yes-or-no-' looks for a symbol<br/>
starting with or containing `no-'.  If you set this variable to<br/>
"\\sw\\|\\s_", that expansion looks for a symbol starting with<br/>
`yes-or-no-'.  Finally, if you set this variable to "\\sw", then<br/>
expanding `yes-or-no-' signals an error because `-' is not part of a word;<br/>
but expanding `yes-or-no' looks for a word starting with `no'.<br/>
<br/>
The recommended value is nil, which will make dabbrev default to<br/>
using "\\sw\\|\\s_".<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
