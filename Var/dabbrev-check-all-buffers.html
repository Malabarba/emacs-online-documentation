<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means dabbrev package should search *all* buffers.<br/>
<br/>
Dabbrev always searches the current buffer first.  Then, if<br/>
`dabbrev-check-other-buffers' says so, it searches the buffers<br/>
designated by `dabbrev-select-buffers-function'.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if `dabbrev-check-all-buffers' is non-nil, dabbrev searches<br/>
all the other buffers, except those named in `dabbrev-ignored-buffer-names',<br/>
or matched by `dabbrev-ignored-regexps'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
