List of errors for which the debugger should not be called.</br>
Each element may be a condition-name or a regexp that matches error messages.</br>
If any element applies to a given error, that error skips the debugger</br>
and just returns to top level.</br>
This overrides the variable `debug-on-error'.</br>
It does not apply to errors handled by `condition-case'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
