<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Enter debugger on this event.  When Emacs</br>
receives the special event specified by this variable, it will try to</br>
break into the debugger as soon as possible instead of processing the</br>
event normally through `special-event-map'.</br>
</br>
Currently, the only supported values for this</br>
variable are `sigusr1' and `sigusr2'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
