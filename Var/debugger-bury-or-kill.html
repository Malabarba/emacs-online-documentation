Its value is <pre>bury</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
What to do with the debugger buffer when exiting `debug'.</br>
The value affects the behavior of operations on any window</br>
previously showing the debugger buffer.</br>
</br>
`nil' means that if its window is not deleted when exiting the</br>
  debugger, invoking `switch-to-prev-buffer' will usually show</br>
  the debugger buffer again.</br>
</br>
`append' means that if the window is not deleted, the debugger</br>
  buffer moves to the end of the window's previous buffers so</br>
  it's less likely that a future invocation of</br>
  `switch-to-prev-buffer' will switch to it.  Also, it moves the</br>
  buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.</br>
</br>
`bury' means that if the window is not deleted, its buffer is</br>
  removed from the window's list of previous buffers.  Also, it</br>
  moves the buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.  This</br>
  value provides the most reliable remedy to not have</br>
  `switch-to-prev-buffer' switch to the debugger buffer again</br>
  without killing the buffer.</br>
</br>
`kill' means to kill the debugger buffer.</br>
</br>
The value used here is passed to `quit-restore-window'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
