<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Default coding system for encoding file names.</br>
This variable is used only when `file-name-coding-system' is nil.</br>
</br>
This variable is set/changed by the command `set-language-environment'.</br>
User should not set this variable manually,</br>
instead use `file-name-coding-system' to get a constant encoding</br>
of file names regardless of the current language environment.</br>
</br>
On MS-Windows, the value of this variable is largely ignored if</br>
`w32-unicode-filenames' (which see) is non-nil.  Emacs on Windows</br>
behaves as if file names were encoded in `utf-8'.
