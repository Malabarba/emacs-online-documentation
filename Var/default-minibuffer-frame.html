default-minibuffer-frame is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is #<frame emacs@GordonFreeman.lan 0x8537700><br/>It is a terminal-local variable; global value is the same.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Minibufferless frames use this frame's minibuffer.<br/><br/>Emacs cannot create minibufferless frames unless this is set to an<br/>appropriate surrogate.<br/><br/>Emacs consults this variable only when creating minibufferless<br/>frames; once the frame is created, it sticks with its assigned<br/>minibuffer, no matter what this variable is set to.  This means that<br/>this variable doesn't necessarily say anything meaningful about the<br/>current set of frames, or where the minibuffer is currently being<br/>displayed.<br/><br/>This variable is local to the current terminal and cannot be buffer-local.
