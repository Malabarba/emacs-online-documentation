<strong>default-minibuffer-frame</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
It is a terminal-local variable; global value is the same.</br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Minibufferless frames use this frame's minibuffer.</br>
Emacs cannot create minibufferless frames unless this is set to an</br>
appropriate surrogate.</br>
</br>
Emacs consults this variable only when creating minibufferless</br>
frames; once the frame is created, it sticks with its assigned</br>
minibuffer, no matter what this variable is set to.  This means that</br>
this variable doesn't necessarily say anything meaningful about the</br>
current set of frames, or where the minibuffer is currently being</br>
displayed.</br>
</br>
This variable is local to the current terminal and cannot be buffer-local.
