Functions run before deleting a frame.</br>
The functions are run with one arg, the frame to be deleted.</br>
See `delete-frame'.</br>
</br>
Note that functions in this list may be called just before the frame is</br>
actually deleted, or some time later (or even both when an earlier function</br>
in `delete-frame-functions' (indirectly) calls `delete-frame'</br>
recursively).
