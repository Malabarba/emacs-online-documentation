<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means NEWLINE in Delphi mode should always reindent the current<br/>
line, insert a blank line and move to the default indent column of the blank<br/>
line.  If nil, then no indentation occurs, and NEWLINE does the usual<br/>
behavior.  This is useful when one needs to do customized indentation that<br/>
differs from the default.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
