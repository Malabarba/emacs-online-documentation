Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If t, restores frames that are fully offscreen onscreen instead.</br>
If `all', also restores frames that are partially offscreen onscreen.</br>
</br>
Note that checking of frame boundaries is only approximate.</br>
It can fail to reliably detect frames whose onscreen/offscreen state</br>
depends on a few pixels, especially near the right / bottom borders</br>
of the screen.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
