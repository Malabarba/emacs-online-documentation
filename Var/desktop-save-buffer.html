<strong>desktop-save-buffer</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>desktop.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, save buffer status in desktop file.</br>
</br>
If the value is a function, it is called by `desktop-save' with argument</br>
DESKTOP-DIRNAME to obtain auxiliary information to save in the desktop</br>
file along with the state of the buffer for which it was called.</br>
</br>
When file names are returned, they should be formatted using the call</br>
"(desktop-file-name FILE-NAME DESKTOP-DIRNAME)".</br>
</br>
Later, when `desktop-read' evaluates the desktop file, auxiliary information</br>
is passed as the argument DESKTOP-BUFFER-MISC to functions in</br>
`desktop-buffer-mode-handlers'.
