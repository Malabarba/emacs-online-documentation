<strong>desktop-save-buffer</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>desktop.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
When non-nil, save buffer status in desktop file.<br/>
This variable becomes buffer local when set.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is a function, it is called by `desktop-save' with argument<br/>
DESKTOP-DIRNAME to obtain auxiliary information to save in the desktop<br/>
file along with the state of the buffer for which it was called.<br/>
<br/>
When file names are returned, they should be formatted using the call<br/>
"(desktop-file-name FILE-NAME DESKTOP-DIRNAME)".<br/>
<br/>
Later, when `desktop-read' evaluates the desktop file, auxiliary information<br/>
is passed as the argument DESKTOP-BUFFER-MISC to functions in<br/>
`desktop-buffer-mode-handlers'.
