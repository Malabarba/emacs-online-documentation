Specifies whether the desktop should be saved when it is killed.</br>
A desktop is killed when the user changes desktop or quits Emacs.</br>
Possible values are:</br>
   t             -- always save.</br>
   ask           -- always ask.</br>
   ask-if-new    -- ask if no desktop file exists, otherwise just save.</br>
   ask-if-exists -- ask if desktop file exists, otherwise don't save.</br>
   if-exists     -- save if desktop file exists, otherwise don't save.</br>
   nil           -- never save.</br>
The desktop is never saved when `desktop-save-mode' is nil.</br>
The variables `desktop-dirname' and `desktop-base-file-name'</br>
determine where the desktop is saved.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
