Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
String marking the start of a comment in the diary, or nil.</br>
Nil means there are no comments.  The diary does not display</br>
parts of entries that are inside comments.  You can use comments</br>
for whatever you like, e.g. for meta-data that packages such as</br>
`appt.el' can use.  Comments may not span multiple lines, and there</br>
can be only one comment on any line.</br>
See also `diary-comment-end'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
