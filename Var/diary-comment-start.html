String marking the start of a comment in the diary, or nil.<br/>
Nil means there are no comments.  The diary does not display<br/>
parts of entries that are inside comments.  You can use comments<br/>
for whatever you like, e.g. for meta-data that packages such as<br/>
`appt.el' can use.  Comments may not span multiple lines, and there<br/>
can be only one comment on any line.<br/>
See also `diary-comment-end'.<br/>

You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
