<strong>diary-date-forms</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>calendar.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is ((month "/" day "[^/0-9]")<br/>
 (month "/" day "/" year "[^0-9]")<br/>
 (monthname " *" day "[^,0-9]")<br/>
 (monthname " *" day ", *" year "[^0-9]")<br/>
 (dayname "\\W"))<br/>

Documentation:<br/>
List of pseudo-patterns describing the forms of date used in the diary.<br/>
The patterns on the list must be MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE and should not match<br/>
any portion of the diary entry itself, just the date component.<br/>
<br/>
A pseudo-pattern is a list of regular expressions and the keywords `month',<br/>
`day', `year', `monthname', and `dayname'.  The keyword `monthname' will<br/>
match the name of the month (see `calendar-month-name-array'), capitalized<br/>
or not, or its user-specified abbreviation (see `calendar-month-abbrev-array'),<br/>
followed by a period or not; it will also match `*'.  Similarly, `dayname'<br/>
will match the name of the day (see `calendar-day-name-array'), capitalized or<br/>
not, or its user-specified abbreviation (see `calendar-day-abbrev-array'),<br/>
followed by a period or not.  The keywords `month', `day', and `year' will<br/>
match those numerical values, preceded by arbitrarily many zeros; they will<br/>
also match `*'.<br/>
<br/>
The matching of the diary entries with the date forms is done with the<br/>
standard syntax table from Fundamental mode, but with the `*' changed so<br/>
that it is a word constituent.<br/>
<br/>
If, to be mutually exclusive, a pseudo-pattern must match a portion of the<br/>
diary entry itself, the first element of the pattern MUST be `backup'.  This<br/>
directive causes the date recognizer to back up to the beginning of the<br/>
current word of the diary entry, so in no case can the pattern match more than<br/>
a portion of the first word of the diary entry.<br/>
<br/>
For examples of three common styles, see `diary-american-date-forms',<br/>
`diary-european-date-forms', and `diary-iso-date-forms'.<br/>
