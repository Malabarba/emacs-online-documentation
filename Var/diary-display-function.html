Function used to display the diary.</br>
The two standard options are `diary-fancy-display' and `diary-simple-display'.</br>
</br>
For historical reasons, `nil' is the same as `diary-simple-display'</br>
(so you must use `ignore' for no display).  Also for historical</br>
reasons, this variable can be a list of functions to run.  These</br>
uses are not recommended and may be removed at some point.</br>
</br>
When this function is called, the variable `diary-entries-list'</br>
is a list, in order by date, of all relevant diary entries in the</br>
form of ((MONTH DAY YEAR) STRING), where string is the diary</br>
entry for the given date.  This can be used, for example, to</br>
produce a different buffer for display (perhaps combined with</br>
holidays), or hard copy output.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.2 of Emacs.
