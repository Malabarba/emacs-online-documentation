<strong>diary-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>calendar.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"~/diary"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Name of the file in which one's personal diary of dates is kept.</br>
</br>
The file's entries are lines beginning with any of the forms</br>
specified by the variable `diary-date-forms', which by default</br>
uses the forms of `diary-american-date-forms':</br>
</br>
            MONTH/DAY</br>
            MONTH/DAY/YEAR</br>
            MONTHNAME DAY</br>
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR</br>
            DAYNAME</br>
</br>
with the remainder of the line being the diary entry string for</br>
that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is a</br>
number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two</br>
digits (if `diary-abbreviated-year-flag' is non-nil).  MONTHNAME</br>
and DAYNAME can be spelled in full (as specified by the variables</br>
`calendar-month-name-array' and `calendar-day-name-array'), or</br>
abbreviated (as specified by `calendar-month-abbrev-array' and</br>
`calendar-day-abbrev-array') with or without a period.  Case is</br>
ignored.  Any of DAY, MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be `*' which</br>
matches any day, month, or year, respectively.  If the date does</br>
not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year.  A</br>
DAYNAME entry applies to the appropriate day of the week in every week.</br>
</br>
You can customize `diary-date-forms' to your preferred format.</br>
Three default styles are provided: `diary-american-date-forms',</br>
`diary-european-date-forms', and `diary-iso-date-forms'.</br>
You can choose between these by setting `calendar-date-style' in your</br>
init file, or by using `calendar-set-date-style' when in the calendar.</br>
</br>
A diary entry can be preceded by the character `diary-nonmarking-symbol'</br>
(ordinarily `&') to make that entry nonmarking--that is, it will not be</br>
marked on dates in the calendar window but will appear in a diary window.</br>
</br>
Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with</br>
either a TAB or one or more spaces.</br>
</br>
Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary</br>
entries (in the default American style):</br>
</br>
     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!</br>
     &1/1. Happy New Year!</br>
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.</br>
     21: Payday</br>
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am</br>

     mar 16 Dad's birthday</br>
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.</br>
     &* 15 time cards due.</br>
</br>
If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with</br>
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line is not displayed in the</br>
diary window; only the continuation lines is shown.  For example, the</br>
single diary entry</br>
</br>
     02/11/1989</br>
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today</br>
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting</br>
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'</br>
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden</br>
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan</br>
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School</br>
</br>
will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This</br>
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if</br>
used with more than one day's entries displayed.</br>
</br>
Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry</br>
</br>
      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation</br>
</br>
causes the diary entry "Vacation" to appear from November 1 through</br>
November 10, 1990.  See the documentation for the function</br>
`diary-list-sexp-entries' for more details.</br>
</br>
Diary entries based on the Hebrew, the Islamic and/or the Bahá'í</br>
calendar are also possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they</br>
are ignored unless you set the `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook' and</br>
the `diary-nongregorian-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the</br>
documentation of these hooks for details.</br>
</br>
Diary files can contain directives to include the contents of other files; for</br>
details, see the documentation for the variable `diary-list-entries-hook'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
