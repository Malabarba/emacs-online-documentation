Hook run after diary file is culled for relevant entries.</br>
</br>
If you add `diary-include-other-diary-files' to this hook, you</br>
will probably also want to add `diary-mark-included-diary-files'</br>
to `diary-mark-entries-hook'.  For example, to cause the fancy</br>
diary buffer to be displayed with diary entries from various</br>
included files, each day's entries sorted into lexicographic</br>
order, add the following to your init file:</br>
</br>
     (setq diary-display-function 'diary-fancy-display)</br>
     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-include-other-diary-files)</br>
     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-sort-entries t)</br>
</br>
Note how the sort function is placed last, so that it can sort</br>
the entries included from other files.</br>
</br>
This hook runs after `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook'.  These two hooks</br>
differ only if you are using included diary files.  In that case,</br>
`diary-nongregorian-listing-hook' runs for each file, whereas</br>
`diary-list-entries-hook' only runs once, for the main diary file.</br>
So for example, to sort the complete list of diary entries you would</br>
use the list-entries hook, whereas to process e.g. Islamic entries in</br>
the main file and all included files, you would use the nongregorian hook.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
