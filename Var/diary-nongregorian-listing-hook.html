List of functions called for listing diary file and included files.</br>
As the files are processed for diary entries, these functions are used</br>
to cull relevant entries.  You can use any or all of</br>
`diary-bahai-list-entries', `diary-hebrew-list-entries', and</br>
`diary-islamic-list-entries'.  The documentation for these functions</br>
describes the style of such diary entries.</br>
</br>
You can use this hook for other functions as well, if you want them to</br>
be run on the main diary file and any included diary files.  Otherwise,</br>
use `diary-list-entries-hook', which runs only for the main diary file.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
