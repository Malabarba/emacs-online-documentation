<strong>diary-number-of-entries</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>diary-lib.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>1</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Specifies how many days of diary entries are to be displayed initially.</br>
This variable affects the diary display when the command M-x diary is</br>
used, or if the value of the variable `calendar-view-diary-initially-flag'</br>
is non-nil.  For example, if the default value 1 is used, then only the</br>
current day's diary entries will be displayed.  If the value 2 is used,</br>
then both the current day's and the next day's entries will be displayed.</br>
</br>
The value can also be a vector such as [0 2 2 2 2 4 1]; this value says</br>
to display no diary entries on Sunday, the entries for the current date</br>
and the day after on Monday through Thursday, Friday through Monday's</br>
entries on Friday, and only Saturday's entries on Saturday.</br>
</br>
This variable does not affect the diary display with the `d' command</br>
from the calendar; in that case, the prefix argument controls the number</br>
of days of diary entries displayed.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
