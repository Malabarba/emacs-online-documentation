Documentation:<br/>
Alist of regexps matching message text and replacement text.<br/>
<br/>
The regexp must match the start of the message text containing an<br/>
appointment, but need not include a leading `^'.  If it matches the<br/>
current message, a diary entry is made from the corresponding<br/>
template.  If the template is a string, it should be suitable for<br/>
passing to `replace-match', and so will have occurrences of `\D' to<br/>
substitute the match for the Dth subexpression.  It must also contain<br/>
a single `%s' which will be replaced with the text of the message's<br/>
Subject field.  Any other `%' characters must be doubled, so that the<br/>
template can be passed to `format'.<br/>
<br/>
If the template is actually a function, it is called with the message<br/>
body text as argument, and may use `match-string' etc. to make a<br/>
template following the rules above.<br/>
