Run by `diary-print-entries' after preparing a temporary diary buffer.<br/>
The buffer shows only the diary entries currently visible in the<br/>
diary buffer.  The default just does the printing.  Other uses<br/>
might include, for example, rearranging the lines into order by<br/>
day and time, saving the buffer instead of deleting it, or<br/>
changing the function used to do the printing.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
