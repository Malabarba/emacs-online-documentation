Run by `diary-print-entries' after preparing a temporary diary buffer.</br>
The buffer shows only the diary entries currently visible in the</br>
diary buffer.  The default just does the printing.  Other uses</br>
might include, for example, rearranging the lines into order by</br>
day and time, saving the buffer instead of deleting it, or</br>
changing the function used to do the printing.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
