<strong>diff-update-on-the-fly</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>diff-mode.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means hunk headers are kept up-to-date on-the-fly.</br>
When editing a diff file, the line numbers in the hunk headers</br>
need to be kept consistent with the actual diff.  This can</br>
either be done on the fly (but this sometimes interacts poorly with the</br>
undo mechanism) or whenever the file is written (can be slow</br>
when editing big diffs).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
