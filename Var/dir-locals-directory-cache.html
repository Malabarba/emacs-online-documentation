List of cached directory roots for directory-local variable classes.</br>
Each element in this list has the form (DIR CLASS MTIME).</br>
DIR is the name of the directory.</br>
CLASS is the name of a variable class (a symbol).</br>
MTIME is the recorded modification time of the directory-local</br>
variables file associated with this entry.  This time is a list</br>
of integers (the same format as `file-attributes'), and is</br>
used to test whether the cache entry is still valid.</br>
Alternatively, MTIME can be nil, which means the entry is always</br>
considered valid.
