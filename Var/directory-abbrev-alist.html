Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist of abbreviations for file directories.</br>
A list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), each meaning to replace</br>
FROM with TO when it appears in a directory name.  This replacement is</br>
done when setting up the default directory of a newly visited file.</br>
</br>
FROM is matched against directory names anchored at the first</br>
character, so it should start with a "\\`", or, if directory</br>
names cannot have embedded newlines, with a "^".</br>
</br>
FROM and TO should be equivalent names, which refer to the</br>
same directory.  Do not use `~' in the TO strings;</br>
they should be ordinary absolute directory names.</br>
</br>
Use this feature when you have directories which you normally refer to</br>
via absolute symbolic links.  Make TO the name of the link, and FROM</br>
the name it is linked to.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
