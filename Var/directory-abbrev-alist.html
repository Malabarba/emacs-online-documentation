directory-abbrev-alist is a variable defined in `files.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Alist of abbreviations for file directories.<br/>A list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), each meaning to replace<br/>FROM with TO when it appears in a directory name.  This replacement is<br/>done when setting up the default directory of a newly visited file.<br/><br/>FROM is matched against directory names anchored at the first<br/>character, so it should start with a "\\`", or, if directory<br/>names cannot have embedded newlines, with a "^".<br/><br/>FROM and TO should be equivalent names, which refer to the<br/>same directory.  Do not use `~' in the TO strings;<br/>they should be ordinary absolute directory names.<br/><br/>Use this feature when you have directories which you normally refer to<br/>via absolute symbolic links.  Make TO the name of the link, and FROM<br/>the name it is linked to.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
