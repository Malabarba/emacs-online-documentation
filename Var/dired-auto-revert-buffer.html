Automatically revert Dired buffer on revisiting.</br>
If t, revisiting an existing Dired buffer automatically reverts it.</br>
If its value is a function, call this function with the directory</br>
name as single argument and revert the buffer if it returns non-nil.</br>
Otherwise, a message offering to revert the changed dired buffer</br>
is displayed.</br>
Note that this is not the same as `auto-revert-mode' that</br>
periodically reverts at specified time intervals.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
