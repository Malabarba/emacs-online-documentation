Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, Dired tries to guess a default target directory.<br/>
This means: if there is a Dired buffer displayed in the next<br/>
window, use its current directory, instead of this Dired buffer's<br/>
current directory.<br/>

The target is used in the prompt for file copy, rename etc.<br/>
