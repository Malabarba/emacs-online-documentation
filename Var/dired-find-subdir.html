<strong>dired-find-subdir</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>dired-x.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, Dired always finds a directory in a buffer of its own.</br>
If nil, Dired finds the directory as a subdirectory in some other buffer</br>
if it is present as one.</br>
</br>
If there are several Dired buffers for a directory, the most recently</br>
used is chosen.</br>
</br>
Dired avoids switching to the current buffer, so that if you have</br>
a normal and a wildcard buffer for the same directory, C-x d will</br>
toggle between those two.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
