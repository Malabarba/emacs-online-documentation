<strong>dired-guess-shell-alist-user</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>dired-x.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
User-defined alist of rules for suggested commands.</br>
These rules take precedence over the predefined rules in the variable</br>
`dired-guess-shell-alist-default' (to which they are prepended).</br>
</br>
Each element of this list looks like</br>
</br>
    (REGEXP COMMAND...)</br>
</br>
where each COMMAND can either be a string or a Lisp expression that evaluates</br>
to a string.  This expression can access the file name as the variable `file'.</br>
If several COMMANDs are given, the first one will be the default</br>
and the rest will be added temporarily to the history and can be retrieved</br>
with M-x previous-history-element (M-p) .</br>
</br>
The variable `dired-guess-shell-case-fold-search' controls whether</br>
REGEXP is matched case-sensitively.</br>
</br>
You can set this variable in your ~/.emacs.  For example, to add rules for</br>
`.foo' and `.bar' files, write</br>
</br>
 (setq dired-guess-shell-alist-user</br>
        '(("\\.foo\\'" "FOO-COMMAND")</br>
          ("\\.bar\\'"</br>
           (if condition</br>
              "BAR-COMMAND-1"</br>
            "BAR-COMMAND-2"))))</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
