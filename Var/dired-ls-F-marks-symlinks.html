dired-ls-F-marks-symlinks is a variable defined in `dired.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Informs Dired about how `ls -lF' marks symbolic links.<br/>Set this to t if `ls' (or whatever program is specified by<br/>`insert-directory-program') with `-lF' marks the symbolic link<br/>itself with a trailing @ (usually the case under Ultrix).<br/><br/>Example: if `ln -s foo bar; ls -F bar' gives `bar -> foo', set it to<br/>nil (the default), if it gives `bar@ -> foo', set it to t.<br/><br/>Dired checks if there is really a @ appended.  Thus, if you have a<br/>marking `ls' program on one host and a non-marking on another host, and<br/>don't care about symbolic links which really end in a @, you can<br/>always set this variable to t.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
