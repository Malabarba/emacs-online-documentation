Its value is <pre>"SXU"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
String of `ls' switches (single letters) except "t" that influence sorting.</br>
</br>
This indicates to Dired which option switches to watch out for because they</br>
will change the sorting order behavior of `ls'.</br>
</br>
To change the default sorting order (e.g. add a `-v' option), see the</br>
variable `dired-listing-switches'.  To temporarily override the listing</br>
format, use `C-u C-x d'.
