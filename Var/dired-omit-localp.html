<strong>dired-omit-localp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>dired-x.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is no-dir<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The LOCALP argument `dired-omit-expunge' passes to `dired-get-filename'.<br/>
If it is `no-dir', omitting is much faster, but you can only match<br/>
against the non-directory part of the file name.  Set it to nil if you<br/>
need to match the entire file name.
