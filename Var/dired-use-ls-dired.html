<strong>dired-use-ls-dired</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>dired.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>unspecified</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means Dired should pass the "--dired" option to "ls".</br>
The special value of `unspecified' means to check explicitly, and</br>
save the result in this variable.  This is performed the first</br>
time `dired-insert-directory' is called.</br>
</br>
Note that if you set this option to nil, either through choice or</br>
because your "ls" program does not support "--dired", Dired</br>
will fail to parse some "unusual" file names, e.g. those with leading</br>
spaces.  You might want to install ls from GNU Coreutils, which does</br>
support this option.  Alternatively, you might want to use Emacs's</br>
own emulation of "ls", by using:</br>
  (setq ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program nil)</br>
  (require 'ls-lisp)</br>
This is used by default on MS Windows, which does not have an "ls" program.</br>
Note that `ls-lisp' does not support as many options as GNU ls, though.</br>
For more details, see Info node `(emacs)ls in Lisp'.</br>

You can customize this variable.
