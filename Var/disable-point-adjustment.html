<strong>disable-point-adjustment</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, suppress point adjustment after executing a command.</br>
</br>
After a command is executed, if point is moved into a region that has</br>
special properties (e.g. composition, display), we adjust point to</br>
the boundary of the region.  But, when a command sets this variable to</br>
non-nil, we suppress the point adjustment.</br>
</br>
This variable is set to nil before reading a command, and is checked</br>
just after executing the command.
