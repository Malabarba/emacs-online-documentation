Documentation:<br/>
Alist of conditional actions for `display-buffer'.<br/>
This is a list of elements (CONDITION . ACTION), where:<br/>
<br/>
 CONDITION is either a regexp matching buffer names, or a<br/>
  function that takes two arguments - a buffer name and the<br/>
  ACTION argument of `display-buffer' - and returns a boolean.<br/>
<br/>
 ACTION is a cons cell (FUNCTION . ALIST), where FUNCTION is a<br/>
  function or a list of functions.  Each such function should<br/>
  accept two arguments: a buffer to display and an alist of the<br/>
  same form as ALIST.  See `display-buffer' for details.<br/>
<br/>
`display-buffer' scans this alist until it either finds a<br/>
matching regular expression or the function specified by a<br/>
condition returns non-nil.  In any of these cases, it adds the<br/>
associated action to the list of actions it will try.<br/>
