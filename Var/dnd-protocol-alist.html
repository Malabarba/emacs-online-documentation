The functions to call for different protocols when a drop is made.</br>
This variable is used by `dnd-handle-one-url' and `dnd-handle-file-name'.</br>
The list contains of (REGEXP . FUNCTION) pairs.</br>
The functions shall take two arguments, URL, which is the URL dropped and</br>
ACTION which is the action to be performed for the drop (move, copy, link,</br>
private or ask).</br>
If no match is found here, and the value of `browse-url-browser-function'</br>
is a pair of (REGEXP . FUNCTION), those regexps are tried for a match.</br>
If no match is found, the URL is inserted as text by calling `dnd-insert-text'.</br>
The function shall return the action done (move, copy, link or private)</br>
if some action was made, or nil if the URL is ignored.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
