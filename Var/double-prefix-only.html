<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means that Double mode mapping only works for prefix keys.</br>
That is, for any key `X' in `double-map', `X' alone will be mapped</br>
but not `C-u X' or `ESC X' since the X is not the prefix key.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
