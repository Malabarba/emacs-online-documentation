Alist of dynamic libraries vs external files implementing them.</br>
Each element is a list (LIBRARY FILE...), where the car is a symbol</br>
representing a supported external library, and the rest are strings giving</br>
alternate filenames for that library.</br>
</br>
Emacs tries to load the library from the files in the order they appear on</br>
the list; if none is loaded, the running session of Emacs won't have access</br>
to that library.</br>
</br>
Note that image types `pbm' and `xbm' do not need entries in this variable</br>
because they do not depend on external libraries and are always available.</br>
</br>
Also note that this is not a generic facility for accessing external</br>
libraries; only those already known by Emacs will be loaded.
