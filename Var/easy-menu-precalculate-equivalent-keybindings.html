Determine when equivalent key bindings are computed for easy-menu menus.<br/>
It can take some time to calculate the equivalent key bindings that are shown<br/>
in a menu.  If the variable is on, then this calculation gives a (maybe<br/>
noticeable) delay when a mode is first entered.  If the variable is off, then<br/>
this delay will come when a menu is displayed the first time.  If you never use<br/>
menus, turn this variable off, otherwise it is probably better to keep it on.
