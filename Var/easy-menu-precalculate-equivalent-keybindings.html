Determine when equivalent key bindings are computed for easy-menu menus.</br>
It can take some time to calculate the equivalent key bindings that are shown</br>
in a menu.  If the variable is on, then this calculation gives a (maybe</br>
noticeable) delay when a mode is first entered.  If the variable is off, then</br>
this delay will come when a menu is displayed the first time.  If you never use</br>
menus, turn this variable off, otherwise it is probably better to keep it on.
