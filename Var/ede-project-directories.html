<strong>ede-project-directories</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ede.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Directories in which EDE may search for project files.<br/>
If the value is t, EDE may search in any directory.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is a function, EDE calls that function with one<br/>
argument, the directory name; the function should return t iff<br/>
EDE should look for project files in the directory.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the value should be a list of fully-expanded directory<br/>
names.  EDE searches for project files only in those directories.<br/>
If you invoke the commands M-x ede or M-x ede-new on a directory<br/>
that is not listed, Emacs will offer to add it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Any other value disables searching for EDE project files.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 23.4 of Emacs.<br/>
