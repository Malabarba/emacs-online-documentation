Directories in which EDE may search for project files.</br>
If the value is t, EDE may search in any directory.</br>
</br>
If the value is a function, EDE calls that function with one</br>
argument, the directory name; the function should return t iff</br>
EDE should look for project files in the directory.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, the value should be a list of fully-expanded directory</br>
names.  EDE searches for project files only in those directories.</br>
If you invoke the commands M-x ede or M-x ede-new on a directory</br>
that is not listed, Emacs will offer to add it to the list.</br>
</br>
Any other value disables searching for EDE project files.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.4 of Emacs.
