edebug-form-data is a variable defined in `edebug.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A list of entries associating symbols with buffer regions.<br/>Each entry is an `edebug--form-data' struct with fields:<br/>SYMBOL, BEGIN-MARKER, and END-MARKER.  The markers<br/>are at the beginning and end of an entry level form and SYMBOL is<br/>a symbol that holds all edebug related information for the form on its<br/>property list.<br/><br/>In the future (haha!), the symbol will be irrelevant and edebug data will<br/>be stored in the definitions themselves rather than in the property<br/>list of a symbol.
