<strong>edebug-on-error</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Value bound to `debug-on-error' while Edebug is active.<br/>
<br/>
If `debug-on-error' is non-nil, that value is still used.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is a list of signal names, Edebug will stop when any of<br/>
these errors are signaled from Lisp code whether or not the signal is<br/>
handled by a `condition-case'.  This option is useful for debugging<br/>
signals that *are* handled since they would otherwise be missed.<br/>
After execution is resumed, the error is signaled again.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
