<strong>edebug-save-displayed-buffer-points</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, save and restore point in all displayed buffers.</br>
</br>
Saving and restoring point in other buffers is necessary if you are</br>
debugging code that changes the point of a buffer that is displayed</br>
in a non-selected window.  If Edebug or the user then selects the</br>
window, the buffer's point will be changed to the window's point.</br>
</br>
Saving and restoring point in all buffers is expensive, since it</br>
requires selecting each window twice, so enable this only if you</br>
need it.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
