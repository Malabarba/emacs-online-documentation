edebug-save-displayed-buffer-points is a variable defined in `edebug.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, save and restore point in all displayed buffers.<br/><br/>Saving and restoring point in other buffers is necessary if you are<br/>debugging code that changes the point of a buffer that is displayed<br/>in a non-selected window.  If Edebug or the user then selects the<br/>window, the buffer's point will be changed to the window's point.<br/><br/>Saving and restoring point in all buffers is expensive, since it<br/>requires selecting each window twice, so enable this only if you<br/>need it.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
