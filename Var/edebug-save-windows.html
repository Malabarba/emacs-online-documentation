<strong>edebug-save-windows</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>edebug.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, Edebug saves and restores the window configuration.</br>
That takes some time, so if your program does not care what happens to</br>
the window configurations, it is better to set this variable to nil.</br>
</br>
If the value is a list, only the listed windows are saved and</br>
restored.</br>
</br>
`edebug-toggle-save-windows' may be used to change this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
