<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The coding system for read to use when running the diff program as a subprocess.<br/>
In most cases, the default will do.  However, under certain circumstances in<br/>
MS-Windows you might need to use something like 'raw-text-dos here.<br/>
So, if the output that your diff program sends to Emacs contains extra ^M's,<br/>
you might need to experiment here, if the default or 'raw-text-dos doesn't<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
