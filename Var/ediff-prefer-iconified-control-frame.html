<strong>ediff-prefer-iconified-control-frame</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ediff-wind.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If t, keep control panel iconified when help message is off.</br>
This has effect only on a windowing system.</br>
If t, hitting `?' to toggle control panel off iconifies it.</br>
</br>
This is only useful in Emacs and only for certain kinds of window managers,</br>
such as TWM and its derivatives, since the window manager must permit</br>
keyboard input to go into icons.  XEmacs completely ignores keyboard input</br>
into icons, regardless of the window manager.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
