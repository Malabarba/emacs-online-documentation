The function used to split the main window between buffer-A and buffer-B.</br>
You can set it to a horizontal split instead of the default vertical split</br>
by setting this variable to `split-window-horizontally'.</br>
You can also have your own function to do fancy splits.</br>
This variable has no effect when buffer-A/B are shown in different frames.</br>
In this case, Ediff will use those frames to display these buffers.</br>

You can customize this variable.
