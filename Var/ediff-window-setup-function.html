Function called to set up windows.</br>
Ediff provides a choice of three functions:</br>
 (1) `ediff-setup-windows-multiframe', which sets the control panel</br>
     in a separate frame.</br>
 (2) `ediff-setup-windows-plain', which does everything in one frame</br>
 (3) `ediff-setup-windows-default' (the default), which does (1)</br>
     on a graphical display and (2) on a text terminal.</br>
</br>
The command M-x ediff-toggle-multiframe can be used to toggle</br>
between the multiframe display and the single frame display.  If</br>
the multiframe function detects that one of the buffers A/B is</br>
seen in some other frame, it will try to keep that buffer in that</br>
frame.</br>
</br>
If you don't like any of the two provided functions, write your own one.</br>
The basic guidelines:</br>
    1. It should leave the control buffer current and the control window</br>
       selected.</br>
    2. It should set `ediff-window-A', `ediff-window-B', `ediff-window-C',</br>
       and `ediff-control-window' to contain window objects that display</br>
       the corresponding buffers.</br>
    3. It should accept the following arguments:</br>
       buffer-A, buffer-B, buffer-C, control-buffer</br>
       Buffer C may not be used in jobs that compare only two buffers.</br>
If you plan to do something fancy, take a close look at how the two</br>
provided functions are written.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
