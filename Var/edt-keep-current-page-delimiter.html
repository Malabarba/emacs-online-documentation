<strong>edt-keep-current-page-delimiter</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>edt.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Emacs MUST be restarted for a change in value to take effect!</br>
Non-nil leaves Emacs value of `page-delimiter' unchanged within EDT</br>
Emulation.  If set to nil (the default), the `page-delimiter' variable</br>
is set to "\f" when edt-emulation-on is first invoked.  This</br>
setting replicates EDT's page delimiter behavior.  The original value</br>
is restored when edt-emulation-off is called.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
