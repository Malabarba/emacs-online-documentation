<strong>edt-use-EDT-control-key-bindings</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>edt.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Emacs MUST be restarted for a change in value to take effect!<br/>
Non-nil causes the control key bindings to be replaced with EDT<br/>
bindings.  If set to nil (the default), EDT control key bindings are<br/>
not used and the current Emacs control key bindings are retained for<br/>
use within the EDT emulation.<br/>
