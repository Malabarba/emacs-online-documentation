<strong>eldoc-message-commands-table-size</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>eldoc.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>31</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Used by `eldoc-add-command' to initialize `eldoc-message-commands' obarray.</br>
It should probably never be necessary to do so, but if you</br>
choose to increase the number of buckets, you must do so before loading</br>
this file since the obarray is initialized at load time.</br>
Remember to keep it a prime number to improve hash performance.
