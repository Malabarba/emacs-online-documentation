Commands after which it is appropriate to print in the echo area.</br>
ElDoc does not try to print function arglists, etc., after just any command,</br>
because some commands print their own messages in the echo area and these</br>
functions would instantly overwrite them.  But `self-insert-command' as well</br>
as most motion commands are good candidates.</br>
This variable contains an obarray of symbols; do not manipulate it</br>
directly.  Instead, use `eldoc-add-command' and `eldoc-remove-command'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
