Non-nil means to scan `preloaded-file-list' when initializing.</br>
Otherwise, just scan the DOC file for functions and variables.</br>
This is faster, but less accurate, since it misses undocumented features.</br>
This may result in spurious warnings about unknown functions, etc.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.2 of Emacs.
