Alist of auto-unlockable modes.<br/>
Each element is a pair (MAJOR-MODE . ACTION), where ACTION is<br/>
one of `kill', `exit' or `all'.  Buffers with matching major<br/>
modes are auto-unlocked for the specific action if their<br/>
inferior processes are not alive.  If this variable is t, all<br/>
buffers associated to inferior processes are auto-unlockable<br/>
for both actions (NOT RECOMMENDED).<br/>
