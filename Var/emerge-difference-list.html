emerge-difference-list is a variable defined in `emerge.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes permanently buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Vector of differences between the variants, and markers in the buffers to<br/>show where they are.  Each difference is represented by a vector of seven<br/>elements.  The first two are markers to the beginning and end of the difference<br/>section in the A buffer, the second two are markers for the B buffer, the third<br/>two are markers for the merge buffer, and the last element is the "state" of<br/>that difference in the merge buffer.<br/>  A section of a buffer is described by two markers, one to the beginning of<br/>the first line of the section, and one to the beginning of the first line<br/>after the section.  (If the section is empty, both markers point to the same<br/>point.)  If the section is part of the selected difference, then the markers<br/>are moved into the flags, so the user can edit the section without disturbing<br/>the markers.<br/>  The "states" are:<br/>	A		the merge buffer currently contains the A variant<br/>	B		the merge buffer currently contains the B variant<br/>	default-A	the merge buffer contains the A variant by default,<br/>			but this difference hasn't been selected yet, so<br/>			change-default commands can alter it<br/>	default-B	the merge buffer contains the B variant by default,<br/>			but this difference hasn't been selected yet, so<br/>			change-default commands can alter it<br/>	prefer-A	in a three-file merge, the A variant is the preferred<br/>			choice<br/>	prefer-B	in a three-file merge, the B variant is the preferred<br/>			choice
