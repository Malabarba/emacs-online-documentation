Vector of differences between the variants, and markers in the buffers to</br>
show where they are.  Each difference is represented by a vector of seven</br>
elements.  The first two are markers to the beginning and end of the difference</br>
section in the A buffer, the second two are markers for the B buffer, the third</br>
two are markers for the merge buffer, and the last element is the "state" of</br>
that difference in the merge buffer.</br>
  A section of a buffer is described by two markers, one to the beginning of</br>
the first line of the section, and one to the beginning of the first line</br>
after the section.  (If the section is empty, both markers point to the same</br>
point.)  If the section is part of the selected difference, then the markers</br>
are moved into the flags, so the user can edit the section without disturbing</br>
the markers.</br>
  The "states" are:</br>
	A		the merge buffer currently contains the A variant</br>
	B		the merge buffer currently contains the B variant</br>
	default-A	the merge buffer contains the A variant by default,</br>
			but this difference hasn't been selected yet, so</br>
			change-default commands can alter it</br>
	default-B	the merge buffer contains the B variant by default,</br>
			but this difference hasn't been selected yet, so</br>
			change-default commands can alter it</br>
	prefer-A	in a three-file merge, the A variant is the preferred</br>
			choice</br>
	prefer-B	in a three-file merge, the B variant is the preferred</br>
			choice<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
