List of keymap alists to use for emulation modes.</br>
It is intended for modes or packages using multiple minor-mode keymaps.</br>
Each element is a keymap alist just like `minor-mode-map-alist', or a</br>
symbol with a variable binding which is a keymap alist, and it is used</br>
the same way.  The "active" keymaps in each alist are used before</br>
`minor-mode-map-alist' and `minor-mode-overriding-map-alist'.
