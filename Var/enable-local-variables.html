<strong>enable-local-variables</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Control use of local variables in files you visit.<br/>
The value can be t, nil, :safe, :all, or something else.<br/>
<br/>
A value of t means file local variables specifications are obeyed<br/>
if all the specified variable values are safe; if any values are<br/>
not safe, Emacs queries you, once, whether to set them all.<br/>
(When you say yes to certain values, they are remembered as safe.)<br/>
<br/>
:safe means set the safe variables, and ignore the rest.<br/>
:all means set all variables, whether safe or not.<br/>
 (Don't set it permanently to :all.)<br/>
A value of nil means always ignore the file local variables.<br/>
<br/>
Any other value means always query you once whether to set them all.<br/>
(When you say yes to certain values, they are remembered as safe, but<br/>
this has no effect when `enable-local-variables' is "something else".)<br/>
<br/>
This variable also controls use of major modes specified in<br/>
a -*- line.<br/>
<br/>
The command M-x normal-mode, when used interactively,<br/>
always obeys file local variable specifications and the -*- line,<br/>
and ignores this variable.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
