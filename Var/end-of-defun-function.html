Function for `end-of-defun' to call.<br/>
This is used to find the end of the defun at point.<br/>
It is called with no argument, right after calling `beginning-of-defun-raw'.<br/>
So the function can assume that point is at the beginning of the defun body.<br/>
It should move point to the first position after the defun.
