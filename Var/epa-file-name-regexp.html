<strong>epa-file-name-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>epa-hook.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "\\.gpg\\(~\\|\\.~[0-9]+~\\)?\\'"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp which matches filenames to be encrypted with GnuPG.<br/>
<br/>
If you set this outside Custom while epa-file is already enabled, you<br/>
have to call `epa-file-name-regexp-update' after setting it to<br/>
properly update file-name-handler-alist.  Setting this through Custom<br/>
does that automatically.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
