Alist of aliases of email addresses that stand for encryption keys.</br>
Each element is a list of email addresses (ALIAS EXPANSIONS...).</br>
When one of the recipients of a message being encrypted is ALIAS,</br>
instead of encrypting it for ALIAS, encrypt it for EXPANSIONS...</br>
</br>
If EXPANSIONS is empty, ignore ALIAS as regards encryption.</br>
This is a handy way to avoid warnings about addresses that you don't</br>
have any key for.</br>
</br>
The command `epa-mail-encrypt' uses this.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
