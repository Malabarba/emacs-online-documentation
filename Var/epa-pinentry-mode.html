<strong>epa-pinentry-mode</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>epa.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The pinentry mode.</br>
</br>
GnuPG 2.1 or later has an option to control the behavior of</br>
Pinentry invocation.  Possible modes are: `ask', `cancel',</br>
`error', and `loopback'.  See the GnuPG manual for the meanings.</br>
</br>
In epa commands, a particularly useful mode is `loopback', which</br>
redirects all Pinentry queries to the caller, so Emacs can query</br>
passphrase through the minibuffer, instead of external Pinentry</br>
program.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
