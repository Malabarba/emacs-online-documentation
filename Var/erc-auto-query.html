If non-nil, create a query buffer each time you receive a private message.</br>
If the buffer doesn't already exist, it is created.</br>

This can be set to a symbol, to control how the new query window</br>
should appear.  The default behavior is to display the buffer in</br>
a new window, but not to select it.  See the documentation for</br>
`erc-join-buffer' for a description of the available choices.</br>
