Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist of channels to autojoin on IRC networks.</br>
Every element in the alist has the form (SERVER . CHANNELS).</br>
SERVER is a regexp matching the server, and channels is the</br>
list of channels to join.</br>
</br>
If the channel(s) require channel keys for joining, the passwords</br>
are found via auth-source.  For instance, if you use ~/.authinfo</br>
as your auth-source backend, then put something like the</br>
following in that file:</br>
</br>
machine irc.example.net login "#fsf" password sEcReT</br>
</br>
Customize this variable to set the value for your first connect.</br>
Once you are connected and join and part channels, this alist</br>
keeps track of what channels you are on, and will join them</br>
again when you get disconnected.  When you restart Emacs, however,</br>
those changes are lost, and the customization you saved the last</br>
time is used again.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
