Its value is (utf-8 . undecided)<br/>

Documentation:<br/>
The default coding system for incoming and outgoing text.<br/>
This is either a coding system, a cons, a function, or nil.<br/>
<br/>
If a cons, the encoding system for outgoing text is in the car<br/>
and the decoding system for incoming text is in the cdr. The most<br/>
interesting use for this is to put `undecided' in the cdr. This<br/>
means that `erc-coding-system-precedence' will be consulted, and the<br/>
first match there will be used.<br/>
<br/>
If a function, it is called with the argument `target' and should<br/>
return a coding system or a cons as described above.<br/>
<br/>
If you need to send non-ASCII text to people not using a client that<br/>
does decoding on its own, you must tell ERC what encoding to use.<br/>
Emacs cannot guess it, since it does not know what the people on the<br/>
other end of the line are using.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
