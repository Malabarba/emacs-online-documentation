Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of regexps matching user identifiers to ignore completely.</br>
</br>
This differs from `erc-ignore-list' in that it also ignores any</br>
messages directed at the user.</br>
</br>
A user identifier has the form "nick!login@host".</br>
</br>
If an identifier matches, or a message is addressed to a nick</br>
whose identifier matches, the message will not be processed.</br>
</br>
CAVEAT: ERC doesn't know about the user and host of anyone who</br>
was already in the channel when you joined, but never said</br>
anything, so it won't be able to match the user and host of those</br>
people.  You can update the ERC internal info using /WHO *.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
