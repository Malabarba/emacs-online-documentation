This is implemented as a hash of hashes, where the outer key is</br>
the canonicalized server name (as returned by</br>
`erc-canonicalize-server-name') and the outer value is a hash</br>
table mapping nicks (as returned by `erc-lurker-maybe-trim') to</br>
the times of their most recently received PRIVMSG on any channel</br>
on the given server.
