An ALIST used for tracking channel modification activity.</br>
Each element looks like (BUFFER COUNT FACE) where BUFFER is a buffer</br>
object of the channel the entry corresponds to, COUNT is a number</br>
indicating how often activity was noticed, and FACE is the face to use</br>
when displaying the buffer's name.  See `erc-track-faces-priority-list',</br>
and `erc-track-showcount'.</br>
</br>
Entries in this list should only happen for buffers where activity occurred</br>
while the buffer was not visible.
