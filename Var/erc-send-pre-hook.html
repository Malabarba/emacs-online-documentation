erc-send-pre-hook is a variable defined in `erc.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hook called first when some text is sent through `erc-send-current-line'.<br/>It gets called with one argument, STRING.<br/><br/>To change the text that will be sent, set the variable STR which is<br/>used in `erc-send-current-line'.<br/><br/>To change the text inserted into the buffer without changing the text<br/>that will be sent, use `erc-send-modify-hook' instead.<br/><br/>Filtering functions can set `erc-send-this' to nil to avoid sending of<br/>that particular string at all and `erc-insert-this' to prevent<br/>inserting that particular string into the buffer.<br/><br/>Note that it's useless to set `erc-send-this' to nil and<br/>`erc-insert-this' to t.  ERC is sane enough to not insert the text<br/>anyway.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
