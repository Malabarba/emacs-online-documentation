<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Hook called first when some text is sent through `erc-send-current-line'.</br>
It gets called with one argument, STRING.</br>
</br>
To change the text that will be sent, set the variable STR which is</br>
used in `erc-send-current-line'.</br>
</br>
To change the text inserted into the buffer without changing the text</br>
that will be sent, use `erc-send-modify-hook' instead.</br>
</br>
Filtering functions can set `erc-send-this' to nil to avoid sending of</br>
that particular string at all and `erc-insert-this' to prevent</br>
inserting that particular string into the buffer.</br>
</br>
Note that it's useless to set `erc-send-this' to nil and</br>
`erc-insert-this' to t.  ERC is sane enough to not insert the text</br>
anyway.</br>

You can customize this variable.
