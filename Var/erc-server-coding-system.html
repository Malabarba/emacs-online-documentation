Its value is <pre>(utf-8 . undecided)</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The default coding system for incoming and outgoing text.</br>
This is either a coding system, a cons, a function, or nil.</br>
</br>
If a cons, the encoding system for outgoing text is in the car</br>
and the decoding system for incoming text is in the cdr. The most</br>
interesting use for this is to put `undecided' in the cdr. This</br>
means that `erc-coding-system-precedence' will be consulted, and the</br>
first match there will be used.</br>
</br>
If a function, it is called with the argument `target' and should</br>
return a coding system or a cons as described above.</br>
</br>
If you need to send non-ASCII text to people not using a client that</br>
does decoding on its own, you must tell ERC what encoding to use.</br>
Emacs cannot guess it, since it does not know what the people on the</br>
other end of the line are using.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
