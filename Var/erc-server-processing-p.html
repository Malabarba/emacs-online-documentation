Non-nil when we're currently processing a message.</br>
</br>
When ERC receives a private message, it sets up a new buffer for</br>
this query.  These in turn, though, do start flyspell. This</br>
involves starting an external process, in which case Emacs will</br>
wait - and when it waits, it does accept other stuff from, say,</br>
network exceptions.  So, if someone sends you two messages</br>
quickly after each other, ispell is started for the first, but</br>
might take long enough for the second message to be processed</br>
first.
