<strong>erc-server-processing-p</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>erc-backend.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>

Non-nil when we're currently processing a message.<br/>
<br/>
When ERC receives a private message, it sets up a new buffer for<br/>
this query.  These in turn, though, do start flyspell. This<br/>
involves starting an external process, in which case Emacs will<br/>
wait - and when it waits, it does accept other stuff from, say,<br/>
network exceptions.  So, if someone sends you two messages<br/>
quickly after each other, ispell is started for the first, but<br/>
might take long enough for the second message to be processed<br/>
first.
