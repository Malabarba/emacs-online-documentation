<strong>erc-track-enable-keybindings</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>erc-track.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>ask</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Whether to enable the ERC track keybindings, namely:</br>
`C-c C-SPC' and `C-c C-@', which both do the same thing.</br>
</br>
The default is to check to see whether these keys are used</br>
already: if not, then enable the ERC track minor mode, which</br>
provides these keys.  Otherwise, do not touch the keys.</br>
</br>
This can alternatively be set to either t or nil, which indicate</br>
respectively always to enable ERC track minor mode or never to</br>
enable ERC track minor mode.</br>
</br>
The reason for using this default value is to both (1) adhere to</br>
the Emacs development guidelines which say not to touch keys of</br>
the form C-c C-<something> and also (2) to meet the expectations</br>
of long-time ERC users, many of whom rely on these keybindings.</br>

You can customize this variable.
