Only track text highlighted with a priority face.</br>
If you would like to ignore changes in certain channels where there</br>
are no faces corresponding to your `erc-track-faces-priority-list', set</br>
this variable.  You can set a list of channel name strings, so those</br>
will be ignored while all other channels will be tracked as normal.</br>
Other options are 'all, to apply this to all channels or nil, to disable</br>
this feature.</br>
</br>
Note: If you have a lot of faces listed in `erc-track-faces-priority-list',</br>
setting this variable might not be very useful.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
