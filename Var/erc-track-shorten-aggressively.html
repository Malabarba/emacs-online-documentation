<strong>erc-track-shorten-aggressively</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>erc-track.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, channel names will be shortened more aggressively.</br>
Usually, names are not shortened if this will save only one character.</br>
Example: If there are two channels, #linux-de and #linux-fr, then</br>
normally these will not be shortened.  When shortening aggressively,</br>
however, these will be shortened to #linux-d and #linux-f.</br>
</br>
If this variable is set to `max', then channel names will be shortened</br>
to the max.  Usually, shortened channel names will remain unique for a</br>
given set of existing channels.  When shortening to the max, the shortened</br>
channel names will be unique for the set of active channels only.</br>
Example: If there are two active channels #emacs and #vi, and two inactive</br>
channels #electronica and #folk, then usually the active channels are</br>
shortened to #em and #v.  When shortening to the max, however, #emacs is</br>
not compared to #electronica -- only to #vi, therefore it can be shortened</br>
even more and the result is #e and #v.</br>
</br>
This setting is used by `erc-track-shorten-names'.</br>
