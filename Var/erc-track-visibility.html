Where do we look for buffers to determine their visibility?</br>
The value of this variable determines, when a buffer is considered</br>
visible or invisible.  New messages in invisible buffers are tracked,</br>
while switching to visible buffers when they are tracked removes them</br>
from the list.  See also `erc-track-when-inactive'.</br>
</br>
Possible values are:</br>
</br>
t                - all frames</br>
visible          - all visible frames</br>
nil              - only the selected frame</br>
selected-visible - only the selected frame if it is visible</br>
</br>
Activity means that there was no user input in the last 10 seconds.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
