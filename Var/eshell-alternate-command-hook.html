Documentation:<br/>
A hook run whenever external command lookup fails.<br/>
If a functions wishes to provide an alternate command, they must throw<br/>
it using the tag `eshell-replace-command'.  This is done because the<br/>
substituted command need not be external at all, and therefore must be<br/>
passed up to a higher level for re-evaluation.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if the function returns a filename, that filename will be invoked<br/>
with the current command arguments rather than the command specified<br/>
by the user on the command line.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
