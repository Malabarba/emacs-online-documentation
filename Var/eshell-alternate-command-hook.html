A hook run whenever external command lookup fails.</br>
If a functions wishes to provide an alternate command, they must throw</br>
it using the tag `eshell-replace-command'.  This is done because the</br>
substituted command need not be external at all, and therefore must be</br>
passed up to a higher level for re-evaluation.</br>
</br>
Or, if the function returns a filename, that filename will be invoked</br>
with the current command arguments rather than the command specified</br>
by the user on the command line.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
