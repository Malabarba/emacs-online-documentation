Its value is <pre>("ls")</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list of commands names or functions, that determine complexity.</br>
That is, if a command is defined by a function named eshell/NAME,</br>
and NAME is part of this list, it is invoked as a complex command.</br>
Complex commands are always correct, but run much slower.  If a</br>
command works fine without being part of this list, then it doesn't</br>
need to be.</br>
</br>
If an entry is a function, it will be called with the name, and should</br>
return non-nil if the command is complex.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
