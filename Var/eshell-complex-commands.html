<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list of commands names or functions, that determine complexity.</br>
That is, if a command is defined by a function named eshell/NAME,</br>
and NAME is part of this list, it is invoked as a complex command.</br>
Complex commands are always correct, but run much slower.  If a</br>
command works fine without being part of this list, then it doesn't</br>
need to be.</br>
</br>
If an entry is a function, it will be called with the name, and should</br>
return non-nil if the command is complex.</br>

You can customize this variable.
