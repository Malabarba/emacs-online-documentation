<strong>eshell-delete-exited-processes</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>esh-proc.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If nil, process entries will stick around until `jobs' is run.</br>
This variable sets the buffer-local value of `delete-exited-processes'</br>
in Eshell buffers.</br>
</br>
This variable causes Eshell to mimic the behavior of bash when set to</br>
nil.  It allows the user to view the exit status of a completed subjob</br>
(process) at their leisure, because the process entry remains in</br>
memory until the user examines it using M-x list-processes.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, if `eshell-done-messages-in-minibuffer' is nil, and this</br>
variable is set to t, the only indication the user will have that a</br>
subjob is done is that it will no longer appear in the</br>
M-x list-processes\ display.</br>
</br>
Note that Eshell will have to be restarted for a change in this</br>
variable's value to take effect.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
