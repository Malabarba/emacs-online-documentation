Called each time a process is exec'd by `eshell-gather-process-output'.</br>
It is passed one argument, which is the process that was just started.</br>
It is useful for things that must be done each time a process is</br>
executed in a eshell mode buffer (e.g., `process-kill-without-query').</br>
In contrast, `eshell-mode-hook' is only executed once when the buffer</br>
is created.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
