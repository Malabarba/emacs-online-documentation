<strong>eshell-force-execution</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>esh-ext.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, try to execute binary files regardless of permissions.</br>
This can be useful on systems like Windows, where the operating system</br>
doesn't happen to honor the permission bits in certain cases; or in</br>
cases where you want to associate an interpreter with a particular</br>
kind of script file, but the language won't let you but a '#!'</br>
interpreter line in the file, and you don't want to make it executable</br>
since nothing else but Eshell will be able to understand</br>
`eshell-interpreter-alist'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
