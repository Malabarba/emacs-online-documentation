Called when a process run by `eshell-gather-process-output' has ended.</br>
It is passed two arguments: the process that was just ended, and the</br>
termination status (as a string).  Note that the first argument may be</br>
nil, in which case the user attempted to send a signal, but there was</br>
no relevant process.  This can be used for displaying help</br>
information, for example.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
