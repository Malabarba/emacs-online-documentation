<strong>eshell-named-command-hook</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>esh-cmd.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A set of functions called before a named command is invoked.</br>
Each function will be passed the command name and arguments that were</br>
passed to `eshell-named-command'.</br>
</br>
If any of the functions returns a non-nil value, the named command</br>
will not be invoked, and that value will be returned from</br>
`eshell-named-command'.</br>
</br>
In order to substitute an alternate command form for execution, the</br>
hook function should throw it using the tag `eshell-replace-command'.</br>
For example:</br>
</br>
  (add-hook 'eshell-named-command-hook 'subst-with-cd)</br>
  (defun subst-with-cd (command args)</br>
    (throw 'eshell-replace-command</br>
	   (eshell-parse-command "cd" args)))</br>
</br>
Although useless, the above code will cause any non-glob, non-Lisp</br>
command (i.e., 'ls' as opposed to '*ls' or '(ls)') to be replaced by a</br>
call to `cd' using the arguments that were passed to the function.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
