Documentation:<br/>
A mapping from BBDB to LDAP attributes.<br/>
This is a list of cons cells (BBDB-FIELD . SPEC-OR-LIST) where<br/>
BBDB-FIELD is the name of a field that must be defined in your BBDB<br/>
environment (standard field names are `name', `company', `net', `phone',<br/>
`address' and `notes').  SPEC-OR-LIST is either a single SPEC or a list<br/>
of SPECs.  Lists of specs are valid only for the `phone' and `address'<br/>
BBDB fields.  SPECs are sexps which are evaluated:<br/>
  a string evaluates to itself,<br/>
  a symbol evaluates to the symbol value.  Symbols naming LDAP attributes<br/>
    present in the record evaluate to the value of the field in the record,<br/>
  a form is evaluated as a function.  The argument list may contain LDAP<br/>
    field names which eval to the corresponding values in the<br/>
    record.  The form evaluation should return something appropriate for<br/>
    the particular BBDB-FIELD (see `bbdb-create-internal').<br/>
    `eudc-bbdbify-phone' and `eudc-bbdbify-address' are provided as convenience<br/>
    functions to parse phones and addresses.<br/>
