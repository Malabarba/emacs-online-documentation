A mapping from BBDB to PH/QI fields.</br>
This is a list of cons cells (BBDB-FIELD . SPEC-OR-LIST) where</br>
BBDB-FIELD is the name of a field that must be defined in your BBDB</br>
environment (standard field names are `name', `company', `net', `phone',</br>
`address' and `notes').  SPEC-OR-LIST is either a single SPEC or a list</br>
of SPECs.  Lists of specs are valid only for the `phone' and `address'</br>
BBDB fields.  SPECs are sexps which are evaluated:</br>
  a string evaluates to itself,</br>
  a symbol evaluates to the symbol value.  Symbols naming PH/QI fields</br>
    present in the record evaluate to the value of the field in the record,</br>
  a form is evaluated as a function.  The argument list may contain PH/QI</br>
    field names which eval to the corresponding values in the</br>
    record.  The form evaluation should return something appropriate for</br>
    the particular BBDB-FIELD (see `bbdb-create-internal').</br>
    `eudc-bbdbify-phone' and `eudc-bbdbify-address' are provided as convenience</br>
    functions to parse phones and addresses.</br>
