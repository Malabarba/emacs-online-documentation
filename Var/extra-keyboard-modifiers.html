<strong>extra-keyboard-modifiers</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 0<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
A mask of additional modifier keys to use with every keyboard character.<br/>
Emacs applies the modifiers of the character stored here to each keyboard<br/>
character it reads.  For example, after evaluating the expression<br/>
    (setq extra-keyboard-modifiers ?\C-x)<br/>
all input characters will have the control modifier applied to them.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the character ?\C-@, equivalent to the integer zero, does<br/>
not count as a control character; rather, it counts as a character<br/>
with no modifiers; thus, setting `extra-keyboard-modifiers' to zero<br/>
cancels any modification.
