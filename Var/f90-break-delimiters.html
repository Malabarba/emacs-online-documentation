Documentation:<br/>
Regexp matching delimiter characters at which lines may be broken.<br/>
There are some common two-character tokens where one or more of<br/>
the members matches this regexp.  Although Fortran allows breaks<br/>
within lexical tokens (provided the next line has a beginning ampersand),<br/>
the constant `f90-no-break-re' ensures that such tokens are not split.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
