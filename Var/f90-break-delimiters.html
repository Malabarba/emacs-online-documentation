Regexp matching delimiter characters at which lines may be broken.</br>
There are some common two-character tokens where one or more of</br>
the members matches this regexp.  Although Fortran allows breaks</br>
within lexical tokens (provided the next line has a beginning ampersand),</br>
the constant `f90-no-break-re' ensures that such tokens are not split.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
