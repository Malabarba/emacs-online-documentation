Regexp specifying two-character tokens not to split when breaking lines.</br>
Each token has one or more of the characters from `f90-break-delimiters'.</br>
Note that if only one of the characters is from that variable,</br>
then the presence of the token here allows a line-break before or</br>
after the other character, where a break would not normally be</br>
allowed.  This minor issue currently only affects "(/" and "/)".
