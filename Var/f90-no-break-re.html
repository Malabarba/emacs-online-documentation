f90-no-break-re is a variable defined in `f90.el'.<br/>Its value is "\\((/\\|\\*\\*\\|/[)/=]\\|<=\\|=[=>]\\|>=\\)"<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Regexp specifying two-character tokens not to split when breaking lines.<br/>Each token has one or more of the characters from `f90-break-delimiters'.<br/>Note that if only one of the characters is from that variable,<br/>then the presence of the token here allows a line-break before or<br/>after the other character, where a break would not normally be<br/>allowed.  This minor issue currently only affects "(/" and "/)".
