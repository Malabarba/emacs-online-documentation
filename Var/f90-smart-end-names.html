Whether completion of END statements should insert optional block names.</br>
For example, when closing a "PROGRAM PROGNAME" block, "PROGNAME" is</br>
optional in the "END PROGRAM" statement.  The same is true for modules,</br>
functions, subroutines, and types.  Some people prefer to omit the name</br>
from the END statement, since it makes it easier to change the name.</br>
</br>
This does not apply to named DO, IF, etc. blocks.  If such blocks</br>
start with a label, they must end with one.</br>
</br>
If an end statement has a name that does not match the start, it is always</br>
corrected, regardless of the value of this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
