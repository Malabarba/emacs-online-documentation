Qualification of END statements according to the matching block start.</br>
For example, change the END that closes an IF block to END IF.</br>
If the block has a label, add it as well (unless `f90-smart-end-names'</br>
says not to).  Allowed values are `blink', `no-blink', and nil.  If nil,</br>
nothing is done.  The other two settings have the same effect, but `blink'</br>
additionally blinks the cursor to the start of the block.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
