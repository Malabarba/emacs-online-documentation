Qualification of END statements according to the matching block start.<br/>
For example, the END that closes an IF block is changed to END<br/>
IF.  If the block has a label, this is added as well.  Allowed<br/>
values are 'blink, 'no-blink, and nil.  If nil, nothing is done.<br/>
The other two settings have the same effect, but 'blink<br/>
additionally blinks the cursor to the start of the block.<br/>
