<strong>face-remapping-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist of face remappings.</br>
Each element is of the form:</br>
</br>
   (FACE . REPLACEMENT),</br>
</br>
which causes display of the face FACE to use REPLACEMENT instead.</br>
REPLACEMENT is a face specification, i.e. one of the following:</br>
</br>
  (1) a face name</br>
  (2) a property list of attribute/value pairs, or</br>
  (3) a list in which each element has the form of (1) or (2).</br>
</br>
List values for REPLACEMENT are merged to form the final face</br>
specification, with earlier entries taking precedence, in the same as</br>
as in the `face' text property.</br>
</br>
Face-name remapping cycles are suppressed; recursive references use</br>
the underlying face instead of the remapped face.  So a remapping of</br>
the form:</br>
</br>
   (FACE EXTRA-FACE... FACE)</br>
</br>
or:</br>
</br>
   (FACE (FACE-ATTR VAL ...) FACE)</br>
</br>
causes EXTRA-FACE... or (FACE-ATTR VAL ...) to be _merged_ with the</br>
existing definition of FACE.  Note that this isn't necessary for the</br>
default face, since every face inherits from the default face.</br>
</br>
If this variable is made buffer-local, the face remapping takes effect</br>
only in that buffer.  For instance, the mode my-mode could define a</br>
face `my-mode-default', and then in the mode setup function, do:</br>
</br>
   (set (make-local-variable 'face-remapping-alist)</br>
	'((default my-mode-default)))).</br>
</br>
Because Emacs normally only redraws screen areas when the underlying</br>
buffer contents change, you may need to call `redraw-display' after</br>
changing this variable for it to take effect.
