Alist of interesting faces and keybindings.</br>
Each element is itself a list: the car is the name of the face,</br>
the next element is the key to use as a keyboard equivalent of the menu item;</br>
the binding is made in `facemenu-keymap'.</br>
</br>
The faces specifically mentioned in this list are put at the top of</br>
the menu, in the order specified.  All other faces which are defined</br>
in `facemenu-listed-faces' are listed after them, but get no</br>
keyboard equivalents.</br>
</br>
If you change this variable after loading facemenu.el, you will need to call</br>
`facemenu-update' to make it take effect.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
