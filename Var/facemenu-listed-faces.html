<strong>facemenu-listed-faces</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>facemenu.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of faces to include in the Face menu.<br/>
Each element should be a symbol, the name of a face.<br/>
The "basic " faces in `facemenu-keybindings' are automatically<br/>
added to the Face menu, and need not be in this list.<br/>
<br/>
This value takes effect when you load facemenu.el.  If the<br/>
list includes symbols which are not defined as faces, they<br/>
are ignored; however, subsequently defining or creating<br/>
those faces adds them to the menu then.  You can call<br/>
`facemenu-update' to recalculate the menu contents, such as<br/>
if you change the value of this variable,<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is t, all faces that you apply to text<br/>
using the face menu commands (even by name), and all faces<br/>
that you define or create, are added to the menu.  You may<br/>
find it useful to set this variable to t temporarily while<br/>
you define some faces, so that they will be added.  However,<br/>
if the value is no longer t and you call `facemenu-update',<br/>
it will remove any faces not explicitly in the list.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
