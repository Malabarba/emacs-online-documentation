Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of faces to include in the Face menu.</br>
Each element should be a symbol, the name of a face.</br>
The "basic " faces in `facemenu-keybindings' are automatically</br>
added to the Face menu, and need not be in this list.</br>
</br>
This value takes effect when you load facemenu.el.  If the</br>
list includes symbols which are not defined as faces, they</br>
are ignored; however, subsequently defining or creating</br>
those faces adds them to the menu then.  You can call</br>
`facemenu-update' to recalculate the menu contents, such as</br>
if you change the value of this variable,</br>
</br>
If this variable is t, all faces that you apply to text</br>
using the face menu commands (even by name), and all faces</br>
that you define or create, are added to the menu.  You may</br>
find it useful to set this variable to t temporarily while</br>
you define some faces, so that they will be added.  However,</br>
if the value is no longer t and you call `facemenu-update',</br>
it will remove any faces not explicitly in the list.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
