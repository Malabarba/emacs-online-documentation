<strong>fast-but-imprecise-scrolling</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, accelerate scrolling operations.</br>
This comes into play when scrolling rapidly over previously</br>
unfontified buffer regions.  Only those portions of the buffer which</br>
are actually going to be displayed get fontified.</br>
</br>
Note that this optimization can cause the portion of the buffer</br>
displayed after a scrolling operation to be somewhat inaccurate.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
