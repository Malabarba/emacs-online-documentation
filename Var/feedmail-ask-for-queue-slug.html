Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, prompt user for part of the queue file name.</br>
The file will automatically get the FQM suffix and an embedded</br>
sequence number for uniqueness, so don't specify that.  feedmail will</br>
get rid of all characters other than alphanumeric and hyphen in the</br>
results.  If this variable is nil or if you just hit return in</br>
response to the prompt, feedmail queuing will take care of things</br>
properly.  At the prompt, completion is available if you want to see</br>
what filenames are already in use, though, as noted, you will not be</br>
typing a complete file name.  You probably don't want to be bothered</br>
with this prompting since feedmail, by default, uses queue file names</br>
based on the subjects of the messages.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
