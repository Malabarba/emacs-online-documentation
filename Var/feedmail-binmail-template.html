<strong>feedmail-binmail-template</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"/bin/mail %s"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Command template for the subprocess which will get rid of the mail.</br>
It can result in any command understandable by /bin/sh.  Might not</br>
work at all in non-UNIX environments.  The single '%s', if present,</br>
gets replaced by the space-separated, simplified list of addressees.</br>
Used in `feedmail-buffer-to-binmail' to form the shell command which</br>
will receive the contents of the prepped buffer as stdin.  The default</br>
value uses /bin/rmail (if it exists) unless `mail-interactive' has been</br>
set non-nil.</br>
</br>
If you'd like your errors to come back as mail instead of immediately</br>
in a buffer, try /bin/rmail instead of /bin/mail.  If /bin/rmail</br>
exists, this can be accomplished by keeping the default nil setting of</br>
`mail-interactive'.  You might also like to consult local mail experts</br>
for any other interesting command line possibilities.  Some versions</br>
of UNIX have an rmail program which behaves differently than</br>
/bin/rmail and complains if feedmail gives it a message on stdin.  If</br>
you don't know about such things and if there is no local expert to</br>
consult, stick with /bin/mail or use one of the other buffer eating</br>
functions.</br>
</br>
The above description applies to "classic" UNIX /bin/mail and /bin/rmail.</br>
On most GNU/Linux systems and perhaps other places, /bin/mail behaves</br>
completely differently and shouldn't be used at all in this template.</br>
Instead of /bin/rmail, there is a /usr/bin/rmail, and it can be used</br>
with a wrapper.  The wrapper is necessary because /usr/bin/rmail on such</br>
systems requires that the first line of the message appearing on standard</br>
input have a UNIX-style From_ postmark.  If you have such a system, the</br>
wrapping can be accomplished by setting the value of `feedmail-binmail-template'</br>
to `feedmail-binmail-gnulinuxish-template'.  You should then send some test</br>
messages to make sure it works as expected.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
