Duration of pause after feedmail-debug messages.</br>
After some messages are divulged, it may be helpful to pause before</br>
something else obliterates them.  This value controls the duration of</br>
the pause.  If the value is nil or 0, the sit-for is not done, which</br>
has the effect of not pausing at all.  Debug messages can be seen after</br>
the fact in the messages buffer.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
