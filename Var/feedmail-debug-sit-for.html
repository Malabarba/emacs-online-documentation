Duration of pause after feedmail-debug messages.<br/>
After some messages are divulged, it may be helpful to pause before<br/>
something else obliterates them.  This value controls the duration of<br/>
the pause.  If the value is nil or 0, the sit-for is not done, which<br/>
has the effect of not pausing at all.  Debug messages can be seen after<br/>
the fact in the messages buffer.<br/>
