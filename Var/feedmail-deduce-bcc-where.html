Where Bcc:/Resent-Bcc: addresses should appear in the envelope list.</br>
Addresses for the message envelope are deduced by examining</br>
appropriate address headers in the message.  Generally, they will show</br>
up in the list of deduced addresses in the order that the headers</br>
happen to appear (duplicate addresses are eliminated in any case).</br>
This variable can be set to the symbol 'first, in which case the</br>
Bcc:/Resent-Bcc: addresses will appear at the beginning in the list;</br>
or, it can be set to the symbol 'last, in which case they will appear</br>
at the end of the list.</br>
</br>
Why should you care?  Well, maybe you don't, and certainly the same</br>
things could be accomplished by affecting the order of message headers</br>
in the outgoing message.  Some people use Bcc: as a way of getting</br>
their own "come back" copy of each message they send.  If Bcc:</br>
addresses are not handled first, there can be substantial delays in</br>
seeing the message again.  Some configurations of sendmail, for example,</br>
seem to try to deliver to each addressee at least once, immediately</br>
and serially, so slow SMTP conversations can add up to a delay.  There</br>
is an option for either 'first or 'last because you might have a</br>
delivery agent that processes the addresses backwards.</br>
