Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, deduce message envelope "from" from header From: or Sender:.</br>
In other words, if there is a Sender: header in the message, temporarily</br>
change the value of `user-mail-address' to be the same while the message</br>
is being sent.  If there is no Sender: header, use the From: header,</br>
if any.  Address values are taken from the actual message just before</br>
it is sent, and the process is independent of the values of</br>
`feedmail-from-line' and/or `feedmail-sender-line'.</br>
</br>
There are many and good reasons for having the message header</br>
From:/Sender: be different from the message envelope "from"</br>
information.  However, for most people and for most circumstances, it</br>
is usual for them to be the same (this is probably especially true for</br>
the case where the user doesn't understand the difference between the</br>
two in the first place).</br>
</br>
The idea behind this feature is that you can have everything set up</br>
some normal way for yourself.  If for some reason you want to send a</br>
message with another From: line, you can just type it at the top of</br>
the message, and feedmail will take care of "fixing up" the envelope</br>
"from".  This only works for mail senders which make use of</br>
`user-mail-address' as the envelope "from" value.  For some mail</br>
senders (e.g., feedmail-buffer-to-bin-mail), there is no simple way to</br>
influence what they will use as the envelope.</br>
