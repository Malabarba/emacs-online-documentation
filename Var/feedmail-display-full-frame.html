<strong>feedmail-display-full-frame</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>queued</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, show prepped messages in a full frame.</br>
If nil, the prepped message will be shown, for confirmation or</br>
otherwise, in some window in the current frame without resizing</br>
anything.  That may or may not display enough of the message to</br>
distinguish it from others.  If set to the symbol 'queued, take</br>
this action only when running the queue.  If set to the symbol</br>
'immediate, take this action only when sending immediately.  For</br>
any other non-nil value, take the action in both cases.  Even if</br>
you're not confirming the sending of immediate or queued messages,</br>
it can still be interesting to see a lot about them as they are</br>
shuttled robotically onward.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
