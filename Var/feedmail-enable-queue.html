<strong>feedmail-enable-queue</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, provide for stashing outgoing messages in a queue.</br>
This is the master on/off switch for feedmail message queuing.</br>
Queuing is quite handy for laptop-based users.  It's also handy if you</br>
get a lot of mail and process it more or less sequentially.  For</br>
example, you might change your mind about contents of a reply based on</br>
a message you see a bit later.</br>
</br>
There is a separate queue for draft messages, intended to prevent</br>
you from accidentally sending incomplete messages.  The queues are</br>
disk-based and intended for later transmission.  The messages are</br>
queued in their raw state as they appear in the mail-mode buffer and</br>
can be arbitrarily edited later, before sending, by visiting the</br>
appropriate file in the queue directory (and setting the buffer to</br>
mail-mode or whatever).  If you visit a file in the queue directory</br>
and try to queue it again, it will just get saved in its existing file</br>
name.  You can move a message from the draft to the main queue or vice</br>
versa by pretending to send it and then selecting whichever queue</br>
directory you want at the prompt.  The right thing will happen.</br>
</br>
To transmit all the messages in the queue, invoke the command</br>
`feedmail-run-the-queue' or `feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
