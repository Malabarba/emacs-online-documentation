<strong>feedmail-enable-spray</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, transmit message separately to each addressee.<br/>
feedmail normally accumulates a list of addressees and passes the message<br/>
along with that list to a buffer-eating function which expects any number<br/>
of addressees.  If this variable is non-nil, however, feedmail will<br/>
repeatedly call the same buffer-eating function.  Each time, the list of<br/>
addressees will be just one item from the original list.  This only affects<br/>
the message envelope addresses and doesn't affect what appears in the<br/>
message headers except as noted.<br/>
<br/>
Spray mode is usually pointless, and if you can't think of a good reason for<br/>
it, you should avoid it since it is inherently less efficient than normal<br/>
multiple delivery.  One reason to use it is to overcome mis-featured mail<br/>
transports which betray your trust by revealing Bcc: addressees in the<br/>
headers of a message.  Another use is to do a crude form of mailmerge, for<br/>
which see `feedmail-spray-address-fiddle-plex-list'.<br/>
<br/>
If one of the calls to the buffer-eating function results in an error,<br/>
what happens next is carelessly defined, so beware.  This should get ironed<br/>
out in some future release, and there could be other API changes for spraying<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
