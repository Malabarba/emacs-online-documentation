feedmail-fiddle-headers-upwardly is a variable defined in `feedmail.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means fiddled header fields should go at the top of the header.<br/>nil means insert them at the bottom.  This is mostly a novelty issue since<br/>the standards define the ordering of header fields to be immaterial and it's<br/>fairly likely that some MTA/MUA along the way will have its own idea of what the<br/>order should be, regardless of what you specify.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
