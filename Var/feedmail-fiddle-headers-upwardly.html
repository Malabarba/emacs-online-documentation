<strong>feedmail-fiddle-headers-upwardly</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means fiddled header fields should go at the top of the header.</br>
nil means insert them at the bottom.  This is mostly a novelty issue since</br>
the standards define the ordering of header fields to be immaterial and it's</br>
fairly likely that some MTA/MUA along the way will have its own idea of what the</br>
order should be, regardless of what you specify.</br>

You can customize this variable.
