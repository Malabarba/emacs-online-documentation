A fiddle-plex is a concise way of specifying header field fiddling.</br>
It is a list of up to 4 elements: NAME, VALUE, ACTION, FOLDING.  The element</br>
VALUE can also be a list sometimes.</br>
</br>
NAME is the name of the header field to be fiddled with.  Although case</br>
doesn't matter in looking for headers, case of NAME is preserved when a header</br>
is inserted via fiddling.  It shouldn't include the trailing colon.</br>
</br>
VALUE is either nil, a simple string, a function returning nil or a string, or,</br>
as described below for ACTION `combine', a list of up to three values.</br>
</br>
ACTION describes the nature of the fiddling to be done.  Possibilities</br>
for ACTION (default is `supplement'):</br>
</br>
  `supplement'  Leave other like fields as-is, insert this one.</br>
</br>
  `replace'     Delete other like fields, if any, and insert this one.</br>
</br>
  `create'      Insert this one only if no like field exists.</br>
</br>
  `combine'     Combine aggregate values of like fields with this one.</br>
                In this case, VALUE has a special form.  It is a list</br>
                of three items: VAL-PRE, VAL-LIKE, and VAL-POST.</br>
                VAL-PRE and VAL-POST are strings or nil.  VAL-LIKE may</br>
                be either a string or a function (it may also be nil,</br>
                but there's not much point to that).</br>
</br>
                Values of like header fields are aggregated, leading and</br>
                trailing whitespace is removed, and embedded</br>
                whitespace is left as-is.  If there are no like</br>
                fields, or the aggregate value is an empty string,</br>
                VAL-LIKE is not used.  Else, if VAL-LIKE is a function,</br>
                it is called with two arguments: NAME and the</br>
                aggregate like values.  Else, if VAL-LIKE is a string, it is</br>
                used as a format string where a single %s will be</br>
                replaced by the aggregate values of like fields.</br>
</br>
                VAL-PRE, the results of using VAL-LIKE, and VAL-POST</br>
                are concatenated, and the result, if not nil and not</br>
                an empty string, is used as the new value for the</br>
                field.  Although this description sounds a bit</br>
                complicated, the idea is to provide a mechanism for</br>
                combining the old value with a new value in a flexible</br>
                way.  For example, if you wanted to add a new value to</br>
                an existing header field by adding a semi-colon and</br>
                then starting the new value on a continuation line,</br>
                you might specify this:</br>
</br>
                 (nil "%s;\n\t" "This is my new value")</br>
</br>
FOLDING can be nil, in which case VALUE is used as-is.  If FOLDING is</br>
non-nil, feedmail "smart filling" is done on VALUE just before</br>
insertion.
