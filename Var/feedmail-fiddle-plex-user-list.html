<strong>feedmail-fiddle-plex-user-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, should be a list of one or more fiddle-plexes.<br/>
Each element of the list can also be a function which returns a<br/>
fiddle-plex.<br/>
<br/>
feedmail will use this list of fiddle-plexes to manipulate user-specified<br/>
message header fields.  It does this after it has completed all normal<br/>
message header field manipulation and before calling `feedmail-last-chance-hook'.<br/>
<br/>
For an explanation of fiddle-plexes, see the documentation for the<br/>
variable `feedmail-fiddle-plex-blurb'.  In contrast to some other fiddle-plex<br/>
manipulation functions, in this context, it makes no sense to have an element<br/>
which is nil, t, or a simple string.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
