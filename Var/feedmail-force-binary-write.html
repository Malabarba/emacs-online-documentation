If non-nil, force writing file as binary (this applies to queues and Fcc:).</br>

feedmail will temporarily manipulate the value of `coding-system-for-write'</br>
to make the writing as binary.  If nil, writing will be in text mode.</br>
On systems where there is no distinction or where it is controlled by other</br>
variables or other means, this option has no effect.</br>

You can customize this variable.
