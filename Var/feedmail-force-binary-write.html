Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, force writing file as binary (this applies to queues and Fcc:).<br/>
On systems where there is a difference between binary and text files,<br/>
feedmail will temporarily manipulate the value of `buffer-file-type'<br/>
to make the writing as binary.  If nil, writing will be in text mode.<br/>
On systems where there is no distinction or where it is controlled by other<br/>
variables or other means, this option has no effect.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
