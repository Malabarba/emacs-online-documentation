feedmail-from-line is a variable defined in `feedmail.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil and the email has no From: header, use this value.<br/>May be t, in which case a default is computed (and you probably won't<br/>be happy with it).  May be nil, in which case nothing in particular is<br/>done with respect to From: lines.  By design, will not replace an<br/>existing From: line, but you can achieve that with a fiddle-plex 'replace<br/>action.<br/><br/>If neither nil nor t, it may be a string, a fiddle-plex, or a function<br/>which returns either nil, t, a string, or a fiddle-plex (or, in fact,<br/>another function, but let's not be ridiculous).  If a string, it<br/>should be just the contents of the header, not the name of the header<br/>itself nor the trailing newline.  If a function, it will be called<br/>with no arguments.  For an explanation of fiddle-plexes, see the<br/>documentation for the variable `feedmail-fiddle-plex-blurb'.  In all<br/>cases the name element of the fiddle-plex is ignored and is hardwired<br/>by feedmail to either "From" or "Resent-From".<br/><br/>A good value would be a string fully-qualified domain name form of<br/>your address.  For example, "bill@example.net (WJCarpenter)".  The<br/>default value of this variable uses the standard elisp variable<br/>`user-mail-address' which should be set on every system but has a decent<br/>chance of being wrong.  It also honors `mail-from-style'.  Better to set<br/>this variable explicitly to the string you want or find some other way<br/>to arrange for the message to get a From: line.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
