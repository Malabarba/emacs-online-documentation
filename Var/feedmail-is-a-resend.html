<strong>feedmail-is-a-resend</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means the message is a Resend (in the RFC-822 sense).<br/>
This affects the composition of certain headers.  feedmail sets this<br/>
variable as soon as it starts prepping the message text buffer, so any<br/>
user-supplied functions can rely on it.  Users shouldn't set or change this<br/>
variable, but may depend on its value as described here.
