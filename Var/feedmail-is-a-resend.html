<strong>feedmail-is-a-resend</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means the message is a Resend (in the RFC-822 sense).</br>
This affects the composition of certain headers.  feedmail sets this</br>
variable as soon as it starts prepping the message text buffer, so any</br>
user-supplied functions can rely on it.  Users shouldn't set or change this</br>
variable, but may depend on its value as described here.
