Documentation:<br/>
User's last opportunity to modify the message on its way out.<br/>
When this hook runs, the current buffer is already the appropriate<br/>
buffer.  It has already had all the header prepping from the standard<br/>
package.  The next step after running the hook will be to save the<br/>
message via FCC: processing. The hook might be interested in these:<br/>
(1) `feedmail-prepped-text-buffer' contains the header and body of the<br/>
message, ready to go; (2) `feedmail-address-list' contains a list<br/>
of simplified recipients of addresses which are to be given to the<br/>
subprocess (the hook may change the list); (3) `feedmail-error-buffer'<br/>
is an empty buffer intended to soak up errors for display to the user.<br/>
If the hook allows interactive activity, the user should not send more<br/>
mail while in the hook since some of the internal buffers will be<br/>
reused and things will get confused.  It's not necessary to<br/>
arrange for the undoing of any changes you make to the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
