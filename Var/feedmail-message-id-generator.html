<strong>feedmail-message-id-generator</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Specifies the creation of a Message-Id: header field.</br>
</br>
If nil, nothing is done about Message-Id:.</br>
</br>
If t, a Message-Id: header of a predetermined format is produced, but</br>
only if there is not already a Message-Id: in the message.  A value of</br>
t is equivalent to using the function feedmail-default-message-id-generator.</br>
</br>
If neither nil nor t, it may be a string, a fiddle-plex, or a function</br>
which returns either nil, t, a string, or a fiddle-plex (or, in fact,</br>
another function, but let's not be ridiculous).  If a string, it</br>
should be just the contents of the header, not the name of the header</br>
itself nor the trailing newline.  If a function, it will be called</br>
with one argument: the possibly-nil name of the file associated with</br>
the message buffer.  For an explanation of fiddle-plexes, see the</br>
documentation for the variable `feedmail-fiddle-plex-blurb'.  In all</br>
cases the name element of the fiddle-plex is ignored and is hardwired</br>
by feedmail to either "Message-Id" or "Resent-Message-Id".</br>
</br>
You should let feedmail generate a Message-Id: for you unless you are sure</br>
that whatever you give your messages to will do it for you (e.g., most</br>
configurations of sendmail).  Even if the latter case is true, it</br>
probably won't hurt you to generate your own, and it will then show up</br>
in the saved message if you use Fcc:.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
