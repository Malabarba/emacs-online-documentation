<strong>feedmail-nuke-bcc-in-fcc</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil remove [Resent-]Bcc: lines in message copies saved via Fcc:.</br>
This is independent of whether the Bcc: header lines are actually sent</br>
with the message (see feedmail-nuke-bcc).  Though not implied in the name,</br>
the same Fcc: treatment applies to both Bcc: and Resent-Bcc: lines.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
