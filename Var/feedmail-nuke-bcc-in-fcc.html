<strong>feedmail-nuke-bcc-in-fcc</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil remove [Resent-]Bcc: lines in message copies saved via Fcc:.<br/>
This is independent of whether the Bcc: header lines are actually sent<br/>
with the message (see feedmail-nuke-bcc).  Though not implied in the name,<br/>
the same Fcc: treatment applies to both Bcc: and Resent-Bcc: lines.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
