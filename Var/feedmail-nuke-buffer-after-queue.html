<strong>feedmail-nuke-buffer-after-queue</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, silently kill the buffer after a message is queued.<br/>
You might like that since a side-effect of queueing the message is<br/>
that its buffer name gets changed to the filename.  That means that<br/>
the buffer won't be reused for the next message you compose.  If you<br/>
are using VM for creating messages, you probably want to leave this<br/>
nil, since VM has its own options for managing the recycling of<br/>
message buffers.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
