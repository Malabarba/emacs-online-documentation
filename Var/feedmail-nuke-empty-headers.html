Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, remove header lines which have no contents.<br/>
A completely empty Subject: header is always removed, regardless of<br/>
the setting of this variable.  The only time you would want them left<br/>
in would be if you used some headers whose presence indicated<br/>
something rather than their contents.  This is rare in Internet email<br/>
but common in some proprietary systems.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
