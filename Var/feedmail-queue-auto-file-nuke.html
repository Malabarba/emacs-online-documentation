<strong>feedmail-queue-auto-file-nuke</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, automatically delete queue files when a message is sent.<br/>
Normally, feedmail will notice such files when you send a message in<br/>
immediate mode (i.e., not when you're running the queue) and will ask if<br/>
you want to delete them.  Since the answer is usually yes, setting this<br/>
variable to non-nil will tell feedmail to skip the prompt and just delete<br/>
the file without bothering you.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
