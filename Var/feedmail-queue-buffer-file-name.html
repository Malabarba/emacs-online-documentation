<strong>feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, has the value normally expected of 'buffer-file-name'.<br/>
You are not intended to set this to something in your configuration.  Rather,<br/>
you might programmatically set it to something via a hook or function<br/>
advice or whatever.  You might like to do this if you are using a mail<br/>
composition program that eventually uses sendmail.el's 'mail-send'<br/>
function to process the message.  If there is a filename associated<br/>
with the message buffer, 'mail-send' will ask you for confirmation.<br/>
There's no trivial way to avoid it.  It's unwise to just set the value<br/>
of 'buffer-file-name' to nil because that will defeat feedmail's file<br/>
management features.  Instead, arrange for this variable to be set to<br/>
the value of 'buffer-file-name' before setting that to nil.  An easy way<br/>
to do that would be with defadvice on 'mail-send' (undoing the<br/>
assignments in a later advice).<br/>
<br/>
feedmail will pretend that 'buffer-file-name', if nil, has the value<br/>
assigned of 'feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name' and carry out its normal<br/>
activities.  feedmail does not restore the non-nil value of<br/>
'buffer-file-name'.  For safe bookkeeping, the user should insure that<br/>
feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name is restored to nil.<br/>
<br/>
Example 'defadvice' for mail-send:<br/>
<br/>
   (defadvice mail-send (before feedmail-mail-send-before-advice activate)<br/>
     (setq feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name buffer-file-name)<br/>
     (setq buffer-file-name nil))<br/>
<br/>
   (defadvice mail-send (after feedmail-mail-send-after-advice activate)<br/>
     (if feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name (setq buffer-file-name feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name))<br/>
     (setq feedmail-queue-buffer-file-name nil))<br/>
