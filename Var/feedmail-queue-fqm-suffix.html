Documentation:<br/>
The FQM suffix used to distinguish feedmail queued message files.<br/>
You probably want this to be a period followed by some letters and/or<br/>
digits.  The distinction is to be able to tell them from other random<br/>
files that happen to be in the `feedmail-queue-directory' or<br/>
`feedmail-queue-draft-directory'.  By the way, FQM stands for feedmail<br/>
queued message.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
