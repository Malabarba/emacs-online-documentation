<strong>feedmail-queue-run-orderer</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, name a function which will sort the queued messages.</br>
The function is called during a running of the queue for sending, and</br>
takes one argument, a list of the files in the queue directory.  It</br>
may contain the names of non-message files, and it's okay to leave</br>
them in the list when reordering it; they get skipped over later.</br>
When nil, the default action processes the messages in normal sort</br>
order by queued file name, which will typically result in the order</br>
they were placed in the queue.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
