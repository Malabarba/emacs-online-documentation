feedmail-queue-runner-cleaner-upper is a variable defined in `feedmail.el'.<br/>Its value is (lambda<br/>  (fqm-file &optional arg)<br/>  (delete-file fqm-file)<br/>  (if arg<br/>      (feedmail-say-chatter "Nuked %s" fqm-file)))<br/><br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Function that will be called after a message has been sent.<br/>Not called in the case of errors.  This function is called with two<br/>arguments: the name of the message queue file for the message just sent,<br/>and the optional argument used in the call to `feedmail-run-the-queue'<br/>or `feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts' (prefix arg if interactive).<br/>In any case, the affiliated buffer is killed elsewhere, so don't do that<br/>inside this function.  Return value is ignored.<br/><br/>The default action is an anonymous function which gets rid of the file<br/>from the queue directory.  With a non-nil second argument, a brief<br/>message is give for each file deleted.  You could replace this<br/>function, for example, to archive all of your sent messages someplace<br/>(though there are better ways to get that particular result).<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
