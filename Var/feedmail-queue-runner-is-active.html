<strong>feedmail-queue-runner-is-active</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means we're inside the logic of the queue-running loop.<br/>
That is, iterating over all messages in the queue to send them.  In<br/>
that case, the value is the name of the queued message file currently<br/>
being processed.  This can be used for differentiating customized code<br/>
for different scenarios.  Users shouldn't set or change this<br/>
variable, but may depend on its value as described here.
