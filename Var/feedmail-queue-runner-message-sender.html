<strong>feedmail-queue-runner-message-sender</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>(lambda (&optional arg) (mail-send))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Function to initiate sending a message file.</br>
Called for each message read back out of the queue directory with a</br>
single argument, the optional argument used in the call to</br>
`feedmail-run-the-queue' or `feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts'.</br>
Interactively, that argument will be the prefix argument.</br>
Most people want `mail-send' (bound to C-c C-s in mail-mode), but here's</br>
your chance to have something different.  The default value is just a</br>
wrapper function which discards the optional argument and calls</br>
mail-send.  If you are a VM user, you might like vm-mail-send, though</br>
you really don't need that.  Called with funcall, not call-interactively.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
