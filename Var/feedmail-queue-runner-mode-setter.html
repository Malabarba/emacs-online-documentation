<strong>feedmail-queue-runner-mode-setter</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>(lambda (&optional arg) (mail-mode))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A function to set the proper mode of a message file.</br>
Called when the message is read back out of the queue directory with a single</br>
argument, the optional argument used in the call to</br>
`feedmail-run-the-queue' or `feedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts'.</br>
</br>
Most people want `mail-mode', so the default value is an anonymous</br>
function which is just a wrapper to ignore the supplied argument when</br>
calling it, but here's your chance to have something different.</br>
If you are a VM user, you might like feedmail-vm-mail-mode, though you</br>
really don't need that (and it's not particularly well-tested).</br>
</br>
Called with funcall, not `call-interactively'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
