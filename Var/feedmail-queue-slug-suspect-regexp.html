feedmail-queue-slug-suspect-regexp is a variable defined in `feedmail.el'.<br/>Its value is "[^a-z0-9-]+"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Regular expression for characters/substrings to be replaced.<br/>When feedmail creates a filename from a subject string, it puts hyphens<br/>in place of strings which may cause problems in filenames.  By default,<br/>only alphanumeric and hyphen characters are kept, and all others are<br/>converted.  In non-ASCII environments, it may be more helpful to<br/>tweak this regular expression to reflect local or personal language<br/>conventions.  Substitutions are done repeatedly until the regular expression<br/>no longer matches to transformed string.  Used by function<br/>feedmail-tidy-up-slug and indirectly by feedmail-queue-subject-slug-maker.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
