<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Regular expression for characters/substrings to be replaced.</br>
When feedmail creates a filename from a subject string, it puts hyphens</br>
in place of strings which may cause problems in filenames.  By default,</br>
only alphanumeric and hyphen characters are kept, and all others are</br>
converted.  In non-ASCII environments, it may be more helpful to</br>
tweak this regular expression to reflect local or personal language</br>
conventions.  Substitutions are done repeatedly until the regular expression</br>
no longer matches to transformed string.  Used by function</br>
feedmail-tidy-up-slug and indirectly by feedmail-queue-subject-slug-maker.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
