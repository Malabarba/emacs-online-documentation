<strong>feedmail-sender-line</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil and the email has no Sender: header, use this value.</br>
May be nil, in which case nothing in particular is done with respect</br>
to Sender: lines.  By design, will not replace an existing Sender:</br>
line, but you can achieve that with a fiddle-plex 'replace action.</br>
NB: it makes no sense to use the value t since there is no sensible</br>
default for Sender:.</br>
</br>
If not nil, it may be a string, a fiddle-plex, or a function which</br>
returns either nil, t, a string, or a fiddle-plex (or, in fact,</br>
another function, but let's not be ridiculous).  If a string, it</br>
should be just the contents of the header, not the name of the header</br>
itself nor the trailing newline.  If a function, it will be called</br>
with no arguments.  For an explanation of fiddle-plexes, see the</br>
documentation for the variable `feedmail-fiddle-plex-blurb'.  In all</br>
cases the name element of the fiddle-plex is ignored and is hardwired</br>
by feedmail to either "Sender" or "Resent-Sender".</br>
</br>
You can probably leave this nil, but if you feel like using it, a good</br>
value would be a string of a fully-qualified domain name form of your</br>
address.  For example, "bill@example.net (WJCarpenter)".  The Sender:</br>
header is fiddled after the From: header is fiddled.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
