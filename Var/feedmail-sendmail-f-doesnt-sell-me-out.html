Says whether the sendmail program issues a warning header if called with "-f".</br>
The sendmail program has a useful feature to let you set the envelope FROM</br>
address via a command line option, "-f".  Unfortunately, it also has a widely</br>
disliked default behavior of selling you out if you do that by inserting</br>
an unattractive warning in the headers.  It looks something like this:</br>
</br>
  X-Authentication-Warning: u1.example.com: niceguy set sender to niceguy@example.com using -f</br>
</br>
It is possible to configure sendmail to not do this, but such a reconfiguration</br>
is not an option for many users.  As this is the default behavior of most</br>
sendmail installations, one can mostly only wish it were otherwise.  If feedmail</br>
believes the sendmail program will sell you out this way, it won't use the "-f"</br>
option when calling sendmail.  If it doesn't think sendmail will sell you out,</br>
it will use the "-f" (since it is a handy feature).  You control what</br>
feedmail thinks with this variable.  The default is nil, meaning that feedmail</br>
will believe that sendmail will sell you out.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
