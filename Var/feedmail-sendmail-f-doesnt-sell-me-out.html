Says whether the sendmail program issues a warning header if called with "-f".<br/>
The sendmail program has a useful feature to let you set the envelope FROM<br/>
address via a command line option, "-f".  Unfortunately, it also has a widely<br/>
disliked default behavior of selling you out if you do that by inserting<br/>
an unattractive warning in the headers.  It looks something like this:<br/>
<br/>
  X-Authentication-Warning: u1.example.com: niceguy set sender to niceguy@example.com using -f<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to configure sendmail to not do this, but such a reconfiguration<br/>
is not an option for many users.  As this is the default behavior of most<br/>
sendmail installations, one can mostly only wish it were otherwise.  If feedmail<br/>
believes the sendmail program will sell you out this way, it won't use the "-f"<br/>
option when calling sendmail.  If it doesn't think sendmail will sell you out,<br/>
it will use the "-f" (since it is a handy feature).  You control what<br/>
feedmail thinks with this variable.  The default is nil, meaning that feedmail<br/>
will believe that sendmail will sell you out.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
