<strong>feedmail-spray-address-fiddle-plex-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>feedmail.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
User-supplied specification for a crude form of mailmerge capability.</br>
When spraying is enabled, feedmail composes a list of envelope addresses.</br>
In turn, `feedmail-spray-this-address' is temporarily set to each address</br>
(stripped of any comments and angle brackets) and a function is called which</br>
fiddles message headers according to this variable.  See the documentation for</br>
`feedmail-fiddle-plex-blurb', for an overview of fiddle-plex data structures.</br>
</br>
May be nil, in which case nothing in particular is done about message</br>
headers for specific addresses.</br>
</br>
May be t, in which case a "To:" header is added to the message with</br>
the stripped address as the header contents.  The fiddle-plex operator</br>
is 'supplement.</br>
</br>
May be a string, in which case the string is assumed to be the name of</br>
a message header field with the stripped address serving as the value.</br>
The fiddle-plex operator is 'supplement.</br>
</br>
May be a function, in which case it is called with no arguments and is</br>
expected to return nil, t, a string, another function, or a fiddle-plex.</br>
The result is used recursively.  The function may alter the value of the</br>
variable feedmail-spray-this-address, perhaps to embellish it with a</br>
human name.  It would be logical in such a case to return as a value a</br>
string naming a message header like "TO" or an appropriately constructed</br>
fiddle-plex.  For an example, see feedmail-spray-via-bbdb.</br>
</br>
May be a list of any combination of the foregoing and/or</br>
fiddle-plexes.  (A value for this variable which consists of a single</br>
fiddle-plex must be nested inside another list to avoid ambiguity.)</br>
If a list, each item is acted on in turn as described above.</br>
</br>
For example,</br>
</br>
  (setq feedmail-spray-address-fiddle-plex-list 'feedmail-spray-via-bbdb)</br>
</br>
The idea of the example is that, during spray mode, as each message is</br>
about to be transmitted to an individual address, the function will be</br>
called and will consult `feedmail-spray-this-address' to find the</br>
stripped envelope email address (no comments or angle brackets).  The</br>
function should return an embellished form of the address.</br>
</br>
The recipe for sending form letters is:  (1) create a message with all</br>
addressees on Bcc: headers; (2) tell feedmail to remove Bcc: headers</br>
before sending the message; (3) create a function which will embellish</br>
stripped addresses, if desired; (4) define `feedmail-spray-address-fiddle-plex-list'</br>
appropriately; (5) send the message with `feedmail-enable-spray' set</br>
non-nil; (6) stand back and watch co-workers wonder at how efficient</br>
you are at accomplishing inherently inefficient things.</br>
