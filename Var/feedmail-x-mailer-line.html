feedmail-x-mailer-line is a variable defined in `feedmail.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Control the form of an X-Mailer: header in an outgoing message.<br/>Moderately useful for debugging, keeping track of your correspondents'<br/>mailer preferences, or just wearing your MUA on your sleeve.  You<br/>should probably know that some people are fairly emotional about the<br/>presence of X-Mailer: lines in email.<br/><br/>If nil, nothing is done about X-Mailer:.<br/><br/>If t, an X-Mailer: header of a predetermined format is produced,<br/>combining its efforts with any existing X-Mailer: header.  If you want<br/>to take the default construct and just add a little blob of your own<br/>at the end, define the variable feedmail-x-mailer-line-user-appendage<br/>as that blob string.  A value of t is equivalent to using the function<br/>feedmail-default-x-mailer-generator.<br/><br/>If neither nil nor t, it may be a string, a fiddle-plex, or a function<br/>which returns either nil, t, a string, or a fiddle-plex (or, in fact,<br/>another function, but let's not be ridiculous).  If a string, it<br/>should be just the contents of the header, not the name of the header<br/>itself nor the trailing newline.  If a function, it will be called<br/>with no arguments.  For an explanation of fiddle-plexes, see the<br/>documentation for the variable `feedmail-fiddle-plex-blurb'.  In all<br/>cases the name element of the fiddle-plex is ignored and is hardwired<br/>by feedmail to either "X-Mailer" or "X-Resent-Mailer".<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
