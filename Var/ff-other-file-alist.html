<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist of extensions to find given the current file's extension.</br>
</br>
This list should contain the most used extensions before the others,</br>
since the search algorithm searches sequentially through each</br>
directory specified in `ff-search-directories'.  If a file is not found,</br>
a new one is created with the first matching extension (`.cc' yields `.hh').</br>
This alist should be set by the major mode.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
