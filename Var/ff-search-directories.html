<strong>ff-search-directories</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>find-file.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>cc-search-directories</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of directories to search for a specific file.</br>
</br>
Set by default to `cc-search-directories', expanded at run-time.</br>
</br>
This list is searched through with each extension specified in</br>
`ff-other-file-alist' that matches this file's extension.  So the</br>
longer the list, the longer it'll take to realize that a file</br>
may not exist.</br>
</br>
A typical format is</br>
</br>
    '("." "/usr/include" "$PROJECT/*/include")</br>
</br>
Environment variables can be inserted between slashes (`/').</br>
They will be replaced by their definition.  If a variable does</br>
not exist, it is replaced (silently) with an empty string.</br>
</br>
The stars are *not* wildcards: they are searched for together with</br>
the preceding slash.  The star represents all the subdirectories except</br>
`..', and each of these subdirectories will be searched in turn.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
