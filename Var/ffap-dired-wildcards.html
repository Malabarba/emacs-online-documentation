<strong>ffap-dired-wildcards</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ffap.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"[*?][^/]*\\'"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A regexp matching filename wildcard characters, or nil.</br>
</br>
If `find-file-at-point' gets a filename matching this pattern,</br>
and `ffap-pass-wildcards-to-dired' is nil, it passes it on to</br>
`find-file' with non-nil WILDCARDS argument, which expands</br>
wildcards and visits multiple files.  To visit a file whose name</br>
contains wildcard characters you can suppress wildcard expansion</br>
by setting `find-file-wildcards'.  If `find-file-at-point' gets a</br>
filename matching this pattern and `ffap-pass-wildcards-to-dired'</br>
is non-nil, it passes it on to `dired'.</br>
</br>
If `dired-at-point' gets a filename matching this pattern,</br>
it passes it on to `dired'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
