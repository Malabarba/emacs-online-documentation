ffap-dired-wildcards is a variable defined in `ffap.el'.<br/>Its value is "[*?][^/]*\\'"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A regexp matching filename wildcard characters, or nil.<br/><br/>If `find-file-at-point' gets a filename matching this pattern,<br/>and `ffap-pass-wildcards-to-dired' is nil, it passes it on to<br/>`find-file' with non-nil WILDCARDS argument, which expands<br/>wildcards and visits multiple files.  To visit a file whose name<br/>contains wildcard characters you can suppress wildcard expansion<br/>by setting `find-file-wildcards'.  If `find-file-at-point' gets a<br/>filename matching this pattern and `ffap-pass-wildcards-to-dired'<br/>is non-nil, it passes it on to `dired'.<br/><br/>If `dired-at-point' gets a filename matching this pattern,<br/>it passes it on to `dired'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
