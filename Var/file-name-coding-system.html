<strong>file-name-coding-system</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Coding system for encoding file names.</br>
If it is nil, `default-file-name-coding-system' (which see) is used.</br>
</br>
On MS-Windows, the value of this variable is largely ignored if</br>
`w32-unicode-filenames' (which see) is non-nil.  Emacs on Windows</br>
behaves as if file names were encoded in `utf-8'.
