file-precious-flag is a variable defined in `files.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means protect against I/O errors while saving files.<br/>Some modes set this non-nil in particular buffers.<br/><br/>This feature works by writing the new contents into a temporary file<br/>and then renaming the temporary file to replace the original.<br/>In this way, any I/O error in writing leaves the original untouched,<br/>and there is never any instant where the file is nonexistent.<br/><br/>Note that this feature forces backups to be made by copying.<br/>Yet, at the same time, saving a precious file<br/>breaks any hard links between it and other files.<br/><br/>This feature is advisory: for example, if the directory in which the<br/>file is being saved is not writable, Emacs may ignore a non-nil value<br/>of `file-precious-flag' and write directly into the file.<br/><br/>See also: `break-hardlink-on-save'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
