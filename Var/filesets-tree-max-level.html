Maximum scan depth for directory trees.</br>
A :tree fileset is defined by a base directory the contents of which</br>
will be recursively added to the menu.  `filesets-tree-max-level' tells up</br>
to which level the directory structure should be scanned/listed,</br>
i.e. how deep the menu should be.  Try something like</br>
</br>
	("HOME -- only one level"</br>
	 (:tree "~" "^[^.].*[^~]$")</br>
	 (:tree-max-level 1)</br>
	 (:filter-dirs-flag t))</br>
	("HOME -- up to 3 levels"</br>
	 (:tree "~" "^[^.].*[^~]$")</br>
	 (:tree-max-level 3)</br>
	 (:filter-dirs-flag t))</br>
</br>
and it should become clear what this option is about.  In any case,</br>
including directory trees to the menu can take a lot of memory.</br>
