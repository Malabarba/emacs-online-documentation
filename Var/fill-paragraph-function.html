<strong>fill-paragraph-function</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>fill.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

Mode-specific function to fill a paragraph, or nil if there is none.</br>
If the function returns nil, then `fill-paragraph' does its normal work.</br>
A value of t means explicitly "do nothing special".</br>
Note: This only affects `fill-paragraph' and not `fill-region'</br>
nor `auto-fill-mode', so it is often better to use some other hook,</br>
such as `fill-forward-paragraph-function'.
