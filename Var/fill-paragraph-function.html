Documentation:<br/>
Mode-specific function to fill a paragraph, or nil if there is none.<br/>
If the function returns nil, then `fill-paragraph' does its normal work.<br/>
A value of t means explicitly "do nothing special".<br/>
Note: This only affects `fill-paragraph' and not `fill-region'<br/>
nor `auto-fill-mode', so it is often better to use some other hook,<br/>
such as `fill-forward-paragraph-function'.
