This variable is a wrapper hook around `filter-buffer-substring'.<br/>
Each member of the hook should be a function accepting four arguments:<br/>
(FUN BEG END DELETE), where FUN is itself a function of three arguments<br/>
(BEG END DELETE).  The arguments BEG, END, and DELETE are the same<br/>
as those of `filter-buffer-substring' in each case.<br/>
<br/>
The first hook function to be called receives a FUN equivalent<br/>
to the default operation of `filter-buffer-substring',<br/>
i.e. one that returns the buffer-substring between BEG and<br/>
END (processed by any `buffer-substring-filters').  Normally,<br/>
the hook function will call FUN and then do its own processing<br/>
of the result.  The next hook function receives a FUN equivalent<br/>
to the previous hook function, calls it, and does its own<br/>
processing, and so on.  The overall result is that of all hook<br/>
functions acting in sequence.<br/>
<br/>
Any hook may choose not to call FUN though, in which case it<br/>
effectively replaces the default behavior with whatever it chooses.<br/>
Of course, a later hook function may do the same thing.
