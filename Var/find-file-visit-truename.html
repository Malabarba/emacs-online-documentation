Non-nil means visiting a file uses its truename as the visited-file name.</br>
That is, the buffer visiting the file has the truename as the</br>
value of `buffer-file-name'.  The truename of a file is found by</br>
chasing all links both at the file level and at the levels of the</br>
containing directories.</br>
