Margins around frame for `fit-frame-to-buffer'.</br>
This specifies the numbers of pixels to be left free on the left,</br>
above, on the right, and below a frame fitted to its buffer.  Set</br>
this to avoid obscuring other desktop objects like the taskbar.</br>
The default is nil for each side, which means to not add margins.</br>
</br>
The value specified here can be overridden for a specific frame</br>
by that frame's `fit-frame-to-buffer-margins' parameter, if</br>
present.  See also `fit-frame-to-buffer-sizes'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
