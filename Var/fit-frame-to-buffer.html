<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means `fit-window-to-buffer' can fit a frame to its buffer.</br>
A frame is fit if and only if its root window is a live window</br>
and this option is non-nil.  If this is `horizontally', frames</br>
are resized horizontally only.  If this is `vertically', frames</br>
are resized vertically only.  Any other non-nil value means</br>
frames can be resized in both dimensions.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
