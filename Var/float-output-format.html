float-output-format is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>The format descriptor string used to print floats.<br/>This is a %-spec like those accepted by `printf' in C,<br/>but with some restrictions.  It must start with the two characters `%.'.<br/>After that comes an integer precision specification,<br/>and then a letter which controls the format.<br/>The letters allowed are `e', `f' and `g'.<br/>Use `e' for exponential notation "DIG.DIGITSeEXPT"<br/>Use `f' for decimal point notation "DIGITS.DIGITS".<br/>Use `g' to choose the shorter of those two formats for the number at hand.<br/>The precision in any of these cases is the number of digits following<br/>the decimal point.  With `f', a precision of 0 means to omit the<br/>decimal point.  0 is not allowed with `e' or `g'.<br/><br/>A value of nil means to use the shortest notation<br/>that represents the number without losing information.
