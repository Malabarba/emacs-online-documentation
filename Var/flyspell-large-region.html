Its value is <pre>1000</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The threshold that determines if a region is small.</br>
If the region is smaller than this number of characters,</br>
`flyspell-region' checks the words sequentially using regular</br>
flyspell methods.  Else, if the region is large, a new Ispell process is</br>
spawned for speed.</br>
</br>
Doubled words are not detected in a large region, because Ispell</br>
does not check for them.</br>
</br>
If this variable is nil, all regions are treated as small.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
