<strong>font-lock-extend-region-functions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>font-lock.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is<br/>
(font-lock-extend-region-wholelines font-lock-extend-region-multiline)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Special hook run just before proceeding to fontify a region.<br/>
This is used to allow major modes to help font-lock find safe buffer positions<br/>
as beginning and end of the fontified region.  Its most common use is to solve<br/>
the problem of /identification/ of multiline elements by providing a function<br/>
that tries to find such elements and move the boundaries such that they do<br/>
not fall in the middle of one.<br/>
Each function is called with no argument; it is expected to adjust the<br/>
dynamically bound variables `font-lock-beg' and `font-lock-end'; and return<br/>
non-nil if it did make such an adjustment.<br/>
These functions are run in turn repeatedly until they all return nil.<br/>
Put first the functions more likely to cause a change and cheaper to compute.
