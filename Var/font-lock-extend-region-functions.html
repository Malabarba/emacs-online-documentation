Its value is <pre></br>
(font-lock-extend-region-wholelines font-lock-extend-region-multiline)

<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>

Special hook run just before proceeding to fontify a region.</br>
This is used to allow major modes to help font-lock find safe buffer positions</br>
as beginning and end of the fontified region.  Its most common use is to solve</br>
the problem of /identification/ of multiline elements by providing a function</br>
that tries to find such elements and move the boundaries such that they do</br>
not fall in the middle of one.</br>
Each function is called with no argument; it is expected to adjust the</br>
dynamically bound variables `font-lock-beg' and `font-lock-end'; and return</br>
non-nil if it did make such an adjustment.</br>
These functions are run in turn repeatedly until they all return nil.</br>
Put first the functions more likely to cause a change and cheaper to compute.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
