A list of the keywords to highlight.</br>
There are two kinds of values: user-level, and compiled.</br>
</br>
A user-level keywords list is what a major mode or the user would</br>
set up.  Normally the list would come from `font-lock-defaults'.</br>
through selection of a fontification level and evaluation of any</br>
contained expressions.  You can also alter it by calling</br>
`font-lock-add-keywords' or `font-lock-remove-keywords' with MODE = nil.</br>
</br>
Each element in a user-level keywords list should have one of these forms:</br>
</br>
 MATCHER</br>
 (MATCHER . SUBEXP)</br>
 (MATCHER . FACENAME)</br>
 (MATCHER . HIGHLIGHT)</br>
 (MATCHER HIGHLIGHT ...)</br>
 (eval . FORM)</br>
</br>
where MATCHER can be either the regexp to search for, or the function name to</br>
call to make the search (called with one argument, the limit of the search;</br>
it should return non-nil, move point, and set `match-data' appropriately if</br>
it succeeds; like `re-search-forward' would).</br>
MATCHER regexps can be generated via the function `regexp-opt'.</br>
</br>
FORM is an expression, whose value should be a keyword element, evaluated when</br>
the keyword is (first) used in a buffer.  This feature can be used to provide a</br>
keyword that can only be generated when Font Lock mode is actually turned on.</br>
</br>
HIGHLIGHT should be either MATCH-HIGHLIGHT or MATCH-ANCHORED.</br>
</br>
For highlighting single items, for example each instance of the word "foo",</br>
typically only MATCH-HIGHLIGHT is required.</br>
However, if an item or (typically) items are to be highlighted following the</br>
instance of another item (the anchor), for example each instance of the</br>
word "bar" following the word "anchor" then MATCH-ANCHORED may be required.</br>
</br>
MATCH-HIGHLIGHT should be of the form:</br>
</br>
 (SUBEXP FACENAME [OVERRIDE [LAXMATCH]])</br>
</br>
SUBEXP is the number of the subexpression of MATCHER to be highlighted.</br>
</br>
FACENAME is an expression whose value is the face name to use.</br>
Instead of a face, FACENAME can evaluate to a property list</br>
of the form (face FACE PROP1 VAL1 PROP2 VAL2 ...)</br>
in which case all the listed text-properties will be set rather than</br>
just FACE.  In such a case, you will most likely want to put those</br>
properties in `font-lock-extra-managed-props' or to override</br>
`font-lock-unfontify-region-function'.</br>
</br>
OVERRIDE and LAXMATCH are flags.  If OVERRIDE is t, existing fontification can</br>
be overwritten.  If `keep', only parts not already fontified are highlighted.</br>
If `prepend' or `append', existing fontification is merged with the new, in</br>
which the new or existing fontification, respectively, takes precedence.</br>
If LAXMATCH is non-nil, that means don't signal an error if there is</br>
no match for SUBEXP in MATCHER.</br>
</br>
For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):</br>
</br>
 "\\<foo\\>"		discrete occurrences of "foo" in the value of the</br>
			variable `font-lock-keyword-face'.</br>
 ("fu\\(bar\\)" . 1)	substring "bar" within all occurrences of "fubar" in</br>
			the value of `font-lock-keyword-face'.</br>
 ("fubar" . fubar-face)	Occurrences of "fubar" in the value of `fubar-face'.</br>
 ("foo\\|bar" 0 foo-bar-face t)</br>
			occurrences of either "foo" or "bar" in the value</br>
			of `foo-bar-face', even if already highlighted.</br>
 (fubar-match 1 fubar-face)</br>
			the first subexpression within all occurrences of</br>
			whatever the function `fubar-match' finds and matches</br>
			in the value of `fubar-face'.</br>
</br>
MATCH-ANCHORED should be of the form:</br>
</br>
 (MATCHER PRE-MATCH-FORM POST-MATCH-FORM MATCH-HIGHLIGHT ...)</br>
</br>
where MATCHER is a regexp to search for or the function name to call to make</br>
the search, as for MATCH-HIGHLIGHT above, but with one exception; see below.</br>
PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are evaluated before the first, and after</br>
the last, instance MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER is used.  Therefore they can be</br>
used to initialize before, and cleanup after, MATCHER is used.  Typically,</br>
PRE-MATCH-FORM is used to move to some position relative to the original</br>
MATCHER, before starting with MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER.  POST-MATCH-FORM might</br>
be used to move back, before resuming with MATCH-ANCHORED's parent's MATCHER.</br>
</br>
For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):</br>
</br>
 ("\\<anchor\\>" (0 anchor-face) ("\\<item\\>" nil nil (0 item-face)))</br>
</br>
 discrete occurrences of "anchor" in the value of `anchor-face', and subsequent</br>
 discrete occurrences of "item" (on the same line) in the value of `item-face'.</br>
 (Here PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are nil.  Therefore "item" is</br>
 initially searched for starting from the end of the match of "anchor", and</br>
 searching for subsequent instances of "anchor" resumes from where searching</br>
 for "item" concluded.)</br>
</br>
The above-mentioned exception is as follows.  The limit of the MATCHER search</br>
defaults to the end of the line after PRE-MATCH-FORM is evaluated.</br>
However, if PRE-MATCH-FORM returns a position greater than the position after</br>
PRE-MATCH-FORM is evaluated, that position is used as the limit of the search.</br>
It is generally a bad idea to return a position greater than the end of the</br>
line, i.e., cause the MATCHER search to span lines.</br>
</br>
These regular expressions can match text which spans lines, although</br>
it is better to avoid it if possible since updating them while editing</br>
text is slower, and it is not guaranteed to be always correct when using</br>
support modes like jit-lock or lazy-lock.</br>
</br>
This variable is set by major modes via the variable `font-lock-defaults'.</br>
Be careful when composing regexps for this list; a poorly written pattern can</br>
dramatically slow things down!</br>
</br>
A compiled keywords list starts with t.  It is produced internally</br>
by `font-lock-compile-keywords' from a user-level keywords list.</br>
Its second element is the user-level keywords list that was</br>
compiled.  The remaining elements have the same form as</br>
user-level keywords, but normally their values have been</br>
optimized.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
