Support mode for Font Lock mode.</br>
Support modes speed up Font Lock mode by being choosy about when fontification</br>
occurs.  The default support mode, Just-in-time Lock mode (symbol</br>
`jit-lock-mode'), is recommended.</br>
</br>
Other, older support modes are Fast Lock mode (symbol `fast-lock-mode') and</br>
Lazy Lock mode (symbol `lazy-lock-mode').  See those modes for more info.</br>
However, they are no longer recommended, as Just-in-time Lock mode is better.</br>
</br>
If nil, means support for Font Lock mode is never performed.</br>
If a symbol, use that support mode.</br>
If a list, each element should be of the form (MAJOR-MODE . SUPPORT-MODE),</br>
where MAJOR-MODE is a symbol or t (meaning the default).  For example:</br>
 ((c-mode . fast-lock-mode) (c++-mode . fast-lock-mode) (t . lazy-lock-mode))</br>
means that Fast Lock mode is used to support Font Lock mode for buffers in C or</br>
C++ modes, and Lazy Lock mode is used to support Font Lock mode otherwise.</br>
</br>
The value of this variable is used when Font Lock mode is turned on.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
