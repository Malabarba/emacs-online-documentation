In fixed format continuation style, this character is inserted in<br/>
column 6 by M-x fortran-split-line to begin a continuation line.<br/>
Also, if M-x fortran-indent-line finds this at the beginning of a<br/>
line, it will convert the line into a continuation line of the<br/>
appropriate style.  Normally "$".<br/>
