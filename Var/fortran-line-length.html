Its value is <pre>72</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Maximum number of characters in a line of fixed-form Fortran code.</br>
Characters beyond this point are treated as comments.  Setting</br>
this variable directly (after fortran mode is loaded) does not</br>
take effect.  Use either M-x customize (which affects all Fortran</br>
buffers and the default) or the function</br>
`fortran-line-length' (which can also operate on just the current</br>
buffer).  This corresponds to the g77 compiler option</br>
`-ffixed-line-length-N'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
