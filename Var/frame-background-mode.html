<strong>frame-background-mode</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>frame.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The brightness of the background.<br/>
Set this to the symbol `dark' if your background color is dark,<br/>
`light' if your background is light, or nil (automatic by default)<br/>
if you want Emacs to examine the brightness for you.  Don't set this<br/>
variable with `setq'; this won't have the expected effect.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
