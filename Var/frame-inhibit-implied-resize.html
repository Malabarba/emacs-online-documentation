<strong>frame-inhibit-implied-resize</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Whether frames should be resized implicitly.</br>
If this option is nil, setting font, menu bar, tool bar, internal</br>
borders, fringes or scroll bars of a specific frame may resize the frame</br>
in order to preserve the number of columns or lines it displays.  If</br>
this option is `t', no such resizing is done.  Note that the size of</br>
fullscreen and maximized frames, the height of fullheight frames and the</br>
width of fullwidth frames never change implicitly.</br>
</br>
The value of this option can be also be a list of frame parameters.  In</br>
this case, resizing is inhibited when changing a parameter that appears</br>
in that list.  The parameters currently handled by this option include</br>
`font', `font-backend', `internal-border-width', `menu-bar-lines' and</br>
`tool-bar-lines'.</br>
</br>
Changing any of the parameters `scroll-bar-width', `scroll-bar-height',</br>
`vertical-scroll-bars', `horizontal-scroll-bars', `left-fringe' and</br>
`right-fringe' is handled as if the frame contained just one live</br>
window.  This means, for example, that removing vertical scroll bars on</br>
a frame containing several side by side windows will shrink the frame</br>
width by the width of one scroll bar provided this option is nil and</br>
keep it unchanged if this option is either `t' or a list containing</br>
`vertical-scroll-bars'.</br>
</br>
The default value is '(tool-bar-lines) on Lucid, Motif and Windows</br>
(which means that adding/removing a tool bar does not change the frame</br>
height), nil on all other window systems including GTK+ (which means</br>
that changing any of the parameters listed above may change the size of</br>
the frame), and `t' otherwise (which means the frame size never changes</br>
implicitly when there's no window system support).</br>
</br>
Note that when a frame is not large enough to accommodate a change of</br>
any of the parameters listed above, Emacs may try to enlarge the frame</br>
even if this option is non-nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
