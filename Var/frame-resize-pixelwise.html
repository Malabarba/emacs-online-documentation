<strong>frame-resize-pixelwise</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means resize frames pixelwise.</br>
If this option is nil, resizing a frame rounds its sizes to the frame's</br>
current values of `frame-char-height' and `frame-char-width'.  If this</br>
is non-nil, no rounding occurs, hence frame sizes can increase/decrease</br>
by one pixel.</br>
</br>
With some window managers you have to set this to non-nil in order to</br>
fully maximize frames.  To resize your initial frame pixelwise,</br>
set this option to a non-nil value in your init file.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
