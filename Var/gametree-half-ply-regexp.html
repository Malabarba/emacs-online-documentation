<strong>gametree-half-ply-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gametree.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>":"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Matches ends of numbers of moves by the "second" player.</br>
For instance, it is an almost universal convention in chess to postfix</br>
numbers of moves by Black (if considered in isolation) by the ellipsis</br>
"...".  This is NOT a good choice for this program, though, because it</br>
conflicts with the use of ellipsis by Outline mode to denote collapsed</br>
subtrees.  The author uses ":" because it agrees nicely with a set of</br>
LaTeX macros he uses for typesetting annotated games.</br>

You can customize this variable.
