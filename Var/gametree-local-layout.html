<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list encoding the layout (i.e. the show or hide state) of the file.</br>
If Emacs notices a local variable specification of this variable in</br>
the first line of the buffer while saving the buffer to the visited</br>
file, the local value will be saved there and restored the next time</br>
the file is visited (subject to the usual restriction via</br>
`enable-local-variables'), and the layout will be set accordingly.
