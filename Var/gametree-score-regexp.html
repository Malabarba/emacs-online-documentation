Regular expression matching lines that guide the program in scoring.</br>
Its third parenthetical group should match the actual score.  Its</br>
first parenthetical group should match the entire score tag.  Its</br>
second parenthetical group should be an optional flag that marks the</br>
line as *manually* (as opposed to automatically) scored, which</br>
prevents the program from recursively applying the scoring algorithm</br>
on the subtree headed by the marked line, and makes it use the manual</br>
score instead.</br>

You can customize this variable.
