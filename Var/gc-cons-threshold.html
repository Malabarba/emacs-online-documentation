Number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.</br>
Garbage collection can happen automatically once this many bytes have been</br>
allocated since the last garbage collection.  All data types count.</br>
</br>
Garbage collection happens automatically only when `eval' is called.</br>
</br>
By binding this temporarily to a large number, you can effectively</br>
prevent garbage collection during a part of the program.</br>
See also `gc-cons-percentage'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
