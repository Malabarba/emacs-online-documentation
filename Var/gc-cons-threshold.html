Documentation:<br/>
Number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.<br/>
Garbage collection can happen automatically once this many bytes have been<br/>
allocated since the last garbage collection.  All data types count.<br/>
<br/>
Garbage collection happens automatically only when `eval' is called.<br/>
<br/>
By binding this temporarily to a large number, you can effectively<br/>
prevent garbage collection during a part of the program.<br/>
See also `gc-cons-percentage'.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
