<strong>gdb-create-source-file-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gdb-mi.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means create a list of files from which the executable was built.<br/>
 Set this to nil if the GUD buffer displays "initializing..." in the mode<br/>
 line for a long time when starting, possibly because your executable was<br/>
 built from a large number of files.  This allows quicker initialization<br/>
 but means that these files are not automatically enabled for debugging,<br/>
 e.g., you won't be able to click in the fringe to set a breakpoint until<br/>
 execution has already stopped there.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 23.1 of Emacs.<br/>
