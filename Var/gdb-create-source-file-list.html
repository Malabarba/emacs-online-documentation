Non-nil means create a list of files from which the executable was built.</br>
Set this to nil if the GUD buffer displays "initializing..." in the mode</br>
line for a long time when starting, possibly because your executable was</br>
built from a large number of files.  This allows quicker initialization</br>
but means that these files are not automatically enabled for debugging,</br>
e.g., you won't be able to click in the fringe to set a breakpoint until</br>
execution has already stopped there.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
