<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means discard any out-of-order GDB replies.</br>
This protects against lost GDB replies, assuming that GDB always</br>
replies in the same order as Emacs sends commands.  When receiving a</br>
reply with a given token-number, assume any pending messages with a</br>
lower token-number are out-of-order.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
