List of functions called whenever GDB stops.</br>
</br>
Each function takes one argument, a parsed MI response, which</br>
contains fields of corresponding MI *stopped async record:</br>
</br>
    ((stopped-threads . "all")</br>
     (thread-id . "1")</br>
     (frame (line . "38")</br>
            (fullname . "/home/sphinx/projects/gsoc/server.c")</br>
            (file . "server.c")</br>
            (args ((value . "0x804b038")</br>
                   (name . "arg")))</br>
            (func . "hello")</br>
            (addr . "0x0804869e"))</br>
     (reason . "end-stepping-range"))</br>
</br>
Note that "reason" is only present in non-stop debugging mode.</br>
</br>
`bindat-get-field' may be used to access the fields of response.</br>
</br>
Each function is called after the new current thread was selected</br>
and GDB buffers were updated in `gdb-stopped'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.2 of Emacs.
