<strong>glasses-convert-on-write-p</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>glasses.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, remove separators when writing glasses buffer to a file.</br>
If you are confused by glasses so much, that you write the separators into code</br>
during coding, set this variable to t.  The separators will be removed on each</br>
file write then.</br>
</br>
Note the removal action does not try to be much clever, so it can remove real</br>
separators too.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
