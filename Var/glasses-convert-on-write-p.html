<strong>glasses-convert-on-write-p</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>glasses.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, remove separators when writing glasses buffer to a file.<br/>
If you are confused by glasses so much, that you write the separators into code<br/>
during coding, set this variable to t.  The separators will be removed on each<br/>
file write then.<br/>
<br/>
Note the removal action does not try to be much clever, so it can remove real<br/>
separators too.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
