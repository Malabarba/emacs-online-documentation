<strong>gnus-activate-foreign-newsgroups</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-start.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>4</pre></br>

*If nil, Gnus will not check foreign newsgroups at startup.</br>
If it is non-nil, it should be a number between one and nine.  Foreign</br>
newsgroups that have a level lower or equal to this number will be</br>
activated on startup.  For instance, if you want to active all</br>
subscribed newsgroups, but not the rest, you'd set this variable to</br>
`gnus-level-subscribed'.</br>
</br>
If you subscribe to lots of newsgroups from different servers, startup</br>
might take a while.  By setting this variable to nil, you'll save time,</br>
but you won't be told how many unread articles there are in the</br>
groups.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
