<strong>gnus-add-timestamp-to-message</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-util.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means add timestamps to messages that Gnus issues.</br>
If it is `log', add timestamps to only the messages that go into the</br>
"*Messages*" buffer (in XEmacs, it is the " *Message-Log*" buffer).</br>
If it is neither nil nor `log', add timestamps not only to log messages</br>
but also to the ones displayed in the echo area.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
