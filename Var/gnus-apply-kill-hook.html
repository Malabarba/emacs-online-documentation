Documentation:<br/>
A hook called to apply kill files to a group.<br/>
This hook is intended to apply a kill file to the selected newsgroup.<br/>
The function `gnus-apply-kill-file' is called by default.<br/>
<br/>
Since a general kill file is too heavy to use only for a few<br/>
newsgroups, I recommend you to use a lighter hook function.  For<br/>
example, if you'd like to apply a kill file to articles which contains<br/>
a string `rmgroup' in subject in newsgroup `control', you can use the<br/>
following hook:<br/>
<br/>
 (setq gnus-apply-kill-hook<br/>
      (list<br/>
	(lambda ()<br/>
	  (cond ((string-match "control" gnus-newsgroup-name)<br/>
		 (gnus-kill "Subject" "rmgroup")<br/>
		 (gnus-expunge "X"))))))<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
