If non-nil, don't require MIME-Version header.<br/>
Some brain-damaged MUA/MTA, e.g. Lotus Domino 5.0.6 clients, does not<br/>
supply the MIME-Version header or deliberately strip it from the mail.<br/>
If non-nil (the default), Gnus will treat some articles as MIME<br/>
even if the MIME-Version header is missing.<br/>

You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
