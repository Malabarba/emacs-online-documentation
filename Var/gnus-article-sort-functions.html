gnus-article-sort-functions is a variable defined in `gnus-sum.el'.<br/>Its value is (gnus-article-sort-by-number)<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*List of functions used for sorting articles in the summary buffer.<br/><br/>Each function takes two articles and returns non-nil if the first<br/>article should be sorted before the other.  If you use more than one<br/>function, the primary sort function should be the last.  You should<br/>probably always include `gnus-article-sort-by-number' in the list of<br/>sorting functions -- preferably first.  Also note that sorting by date<br/>is often much slower than sorting by number, and the sorting order is<br/>very similar.  (Sorting by date means sorting by the time the message<br/>was sent, sorting by number means sorting by arrival time.)<br/><br/>Each item can also be a list `(not F)' where F is a function;<br/>this reverses the sort order.<br/><br/>Ready-made functions include `gnus-article-sort-by-number',<br/>`gnus-article-sort-by-author', `gnus-article-sort-by-subject',<br/>`gnus-article-sort-by-date', `gnus-article-sort-by-random'<br/>and `gnus-article-sort-by-score'.<br/><br/>When threading is turned on, the variable `gnus-thread-sort-functions'<br/>controls how articles are sorted.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
