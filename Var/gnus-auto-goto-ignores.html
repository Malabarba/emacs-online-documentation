This variable can either be the symbols nil (maneuver to any</br>
article), `undownloaded' (maneuvering while unplugged ignores articles</br>
that have not been fetched), `always-undownloaded' (maneuvering always</br>
ignores articles that have not been fetched), `unfetched' (maneuvering</br>
ignores articles whose headers have not been fetched).</br>

NOTE: The list of unfetched articles will always be nil when plugged</br>
and, when unplugged, a subset of the undownloaded article list.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
