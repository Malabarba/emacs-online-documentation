Please do not delete that.\nThey will tell the Bug People what your environment is, so that it\nwill be easier to locate the bugs.\n\nIf you have found a bug that makes Emacs go \"beep\", set\ndebug-on-error to t (`M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET')\nand include the backtrace in your bug report.\n\nPlease describe the bug in annoying, painstaking detail.\n\nThank you for your help in stamping out bugs.\n"<br/>
