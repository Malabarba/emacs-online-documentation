*Integer that says how many emacs-related buttons Gnus will show.</br>
The higher the number, the more buttons will appear and the more false</br>
positives are possible.  Note that you can set this variable local to</br>
specific groups.  Setting it higher in Emacs or Gnus related groups is</br>
probably a good idea.  See Info node `(gnus)Group Parameters' and the variable</br>
`gnus-parameters' on how to set variables in specific groups.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
