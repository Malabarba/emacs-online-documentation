What to do when the button on a string as "foo123@bar.invalid" is pushed.</br>
Strings like this can be either a message ID or a mail address.  If it is one</br>
of the symbols `mid' or `mail', Gnus will always assume that the string is a</br>
message ID or a mail address, respectively.  If this variable is set to the</br>
symbol `ask', always query the user what do do.  If it is a function, this</br>
function will be called with the string as its only argument.  The function</br>
must return `mid', `mail', `invalid' or `ask'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
