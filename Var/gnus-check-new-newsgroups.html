gnus-check-new-newsgroups is a variable defined in `gnus-start.el'.<br/>Its value is ask-server<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Non-nil means that Gnus will run `gnus-find-new-newsgroups' at startup.<br/>This normally finds new newsgroups by comparing the active groups the<br/>servers have already reported with those Gnus already knows, either alive<br/>or killed.<br/><br/>When any of the following are true, `gnus-find-new-newsgroups' will instead<br/>ask the servers (primary, secondary, and archive servers) to list new<br/>groups since the last time it checked:<br/>  1. This variable is `ask-server'.<br/>  2. This variable is a list of select methods (see below).<br/>  3. `gnus-read-active-file' is nil or `some'.<br/>  4. A prefix argument is given to `gnus-find-new-newsgroups' interactively.<br/><br/>Thus, if this variable is `ask-server' or a list of select methods or<br/>`gnus-read-active-file' is nil or `some', then the killed list is no<br/>longer necessary, so you could safely set `gnus-save-killed-list' to nil.<br/><br/>This variable can be a list of select methods which Gnus will query with<br/>the `ask-server' method in addition to the primary, secondary, and archive<br/>servers.<br/><br/>E.g.:<br/>  (setq gnus-check-new-newsgroups<br/>	'((nntp "some.server") (nntp "other.server")))<br/><br/>If this variable is nil, then you have to tell Gnus explicitly to<br/>check for new newsgroups with M-x gnus-find-new-newsgroups.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
