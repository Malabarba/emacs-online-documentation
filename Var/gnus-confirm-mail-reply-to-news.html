<strong>gnus-confirm-mail-reply-to-news</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-msg.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, Gnus requests confirmation when replying to news.<br/>
This is done because new users often reply by mistake when reading<br/>
news.<br/>
This can also be a function receiving the group name as the only<br/>
parameter, which should return non-nil if a confirmation is needed; or<br/>
a regexp, in which case a confirmation is asked for if the group name<br/>
matches the regexp.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 23.1 of Emacs.<br/>
