Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Non-nil means that Gnus will try to build threads by grabbing old headers.</br>
If an unread article in the group refers to an older, already</br>
read (or just marked as read) article, the old article will not</br>
normally be displayed in the Summary buffer.  If this variable is</br>
t, Gnus will attempt to grab the headers to the old articles, and</br>
thereby build complete threads.  If it has the value `some', all</br>
old headers will be fetched but only enough headers to connect</br>
otherwise loose threads will be displayed.  This variable can</br>
also be a number.  In that case, no more than that number of old</br>
headers will be fetched.  If it has the value `invisible', all</br>
old headers will be fetched, but none will be displayed.</br>
</br>
The server has to support NOV for any of this to work.</br>
</br>
This feature can seriously impact performance it ignores all</br>
locally cached header entries.  Setting it to t for groups for a</br>
server that doesn't expire articles (such as news.gmane.org),</br>
leads to very slow summary generation.</br>
