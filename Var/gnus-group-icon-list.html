gnus-group-icon-list is a variable defined in `gnus-group.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Controls the insertion of icons into group buffer lines.<br/><br/>Below is a list of `Form'/`File' pairs.  When deciding how a<br/>particular group line should be displayed, each form is evaluated.<br/>The icon from the file field after the first true form is used.  You<br/>can change how those group lines are displayed by editing the file<br/>field.  The File will either be found in the<br/>`gnus-group-glyph-directory' or by designating absolute name of the<br/>file.<br/><br/>It is also possible to change and add form fields, but currently that<br/>requires an understanding of Lisp expressions.  Hopefully this will<br/>change in a future release.  For now, you can use the following<br/>variables in the Lisp expression:<br/><br/>group: The name of the group.<br/>unread: The number of unread articles in the group.<br/>method: The select method used.<br/>mailp: Whether it's a mail group or not.<br/>level: The level of the group.<br/>score: The score of the group.<br/>ticked: The number of ticked articles.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
