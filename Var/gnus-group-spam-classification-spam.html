Spam group classification (requires spam.el).<br/>
This group contains spam messages.  On summary entry, unread messages<br/>
will be marked as spam.  On summary exit, the specified spam<br/>
processors will be invoked on spam-marked messages, then those<br/>
messages will be expired, so the spam processor will only see a<br/>
spam-marked message once.
