*Groups in which to explicitly send ham articles to</br>
another group, or do nothing (the default).  If non-nil, this should</br>
be a list of group name regexps that should match all groups in which</br>
to do ham article moving, associated with the destination</br>
group or nil for explicit ignoring.  This only makes sense for</br>
mail groups, and only works in spam groups.</br>
