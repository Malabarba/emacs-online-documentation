Documentation:<br/>
*Groups in which to explicitly send ham articles to<br/>
another group, or do nothing (the default).  If non-nil, this should<br/>
be a list of group name regexps that should match all groups in which<br/>
to do ham article moving, associated with the destination<br/>
group or nil for explicit ignoring.  This only makes sense for<br/>
mail groups, and only works in spam groups.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
