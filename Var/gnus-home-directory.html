<strong>gnus-home-directory</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "~/"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Directory variable that specifies the "home" directory.<br/>
All other Gnus file and directory variables are initialized from this variable.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Gnus is mostly loaded when the `.gnus.el' file is read.<br/>
This means that other directory variables that are initialized<br/>
from this variable won't be set properly if you set this variable<br/>
in `.gnus.el'.  Set this variable in `.emacs' instead.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
