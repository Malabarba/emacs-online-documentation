<strong>gnus-message-archive-group</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>((format-time-string "sent.%Y-%m"))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Name of the group in which to save the messages you've written.</br>
This can either be a string; a list of strings; or an alist</br>
of regexps/functions/forms to be evaluated to return a string (or a list</br>
of strings).  The functions are called with the name of the current</br>
group (or nil) as a parameter.</br>
</br>
If you want to save your mail in one group and the news articles you</br>
write in another group, you could say something like:</br>
</br>
 (setq gnus-message-archive-group</br>
	'((if (message-news-p)</br>
	      "misc-news"</br>
	    "misc-mail")))</br>
</br>
Normally the group names returned by this variable should be</br>
unprefixed -- which implicitly means "store on the archive server".</br>
However, you may wish to store the message on some other server.  In</br>
that case, just return a fully prefixed name of the group --</br>
"nnml+private:mail.misc", for instance.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
