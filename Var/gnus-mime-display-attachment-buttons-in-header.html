<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Add attachment buttons in the end of the header of an article.</br>
Since MIME attachments tend to be put at the end of an article, we may</br>
overlook them if there is a huge body.  This option offers you a copy</br>
of all non-inlinable MIME parts as buttons shown in front of an article.</br>
If nil, don't show those extra buttons.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
