<strong>gnus-post-method</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-msg.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is current<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Preferred method for posting USENET news.<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is `current' (which is the default), Gnus will use<br/>
the "current" select method when posting.  If it is `native', Gnus<br/>
will use the native select method when posting.<br/>
<br/>
This method will not be used in mail groups and the like, only in<br/>
"real" newsgroups.<br/>
<br/>
If not `native' nor `current', the value must be a valid method as discussed<br/>
in the documentation of `gnus-select-method'.  It can also be a list of<br/>
methods.  If that is the case, the user will be queried for what select<br/>
method to use when posting.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
