*This variable says how much prompting is to be done when saving articles.</br>
If it is nil, no prompting will be done, and the articles will be</br>
saved to the default files.  If this variable is `always', each and</br>
every article that is saved will be preceded by a prompt, even when</br>
saving large batches of articles.  If this variable is neither nil not</br>
`always', there the user will be prompted once for a file name for</br>
each invocation of the saving commands.</br>

You can customize this variable.
