<strong>gnus-read-active-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-start.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is some<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Non-nil means that Gnus will read the entire active file at startup.<br/>
If this variable is nil, Gnus will only know about the groups in your<br/>
`.newsrc' file.<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is `some', Gnus will try to only read the relevant<br/>
parts of the active file from the server.  Not all servers support<br/>
this, and it might be quite slow with other servers, but this should<br/>
generally be faster than both the t and nil value.<br/>
<br/>
If you set this variable to nil or `some', you probably still want to<br/>
be told about new newsgroups that arrive.  To do that, set<br/>
`gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `ask-server'.  This may not work<br/>
properly with all servers.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
