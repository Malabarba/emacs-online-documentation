*Non-nil means that Gnus will read the `.newsrc' file.</br>
Gnus always reads its own startup file, which is called</br>
".newsrc.eld".  The file called ".newsrc" is in a format that can</br>
be readily understood by other newsreaders.  If you don't plan on</br>
using other newsreaders, set this variable to nil to save some time on</br>
entry.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
