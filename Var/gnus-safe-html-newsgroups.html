<strong>gnus-safe-html-newsgroups</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-group.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"\\`nnrss[+:]"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Groups in which links in html articles are considered all safe.</br>
The value may be a regexp matching those groups, a list of group names,</br>
or nil.  This overrides `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' (which see).  This is</br>
effective only when emacs-w3m renders html articles, i.e., in the case</br>
`mm-text-html-renderer' is set to `w3m'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.2 of Emacs.
