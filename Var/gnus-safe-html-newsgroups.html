<strong>gnus-safe-html-newsgroups</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus-group.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "\\`nnrss[+:]"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Groups in which links in html articles are considered all safe.<br/>
The value may be a regexp matching those groups, a list of group names,<br/>
or nil.  This overrides `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' (which see).  This is<br/>
effective only when emacs-w3m renders html articles, i.e., in the case<br/>
`mm-text-html-renderer' is set to `w3m'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 23.2 of Emacs.<br/>
