gnus-score-exact-adapt-limit is a variable defined in `gnus-score.el'.<br/>Its value is 10<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Number that says how long a match has to be before using substring matching.<br/>When doing adaptive scoring, one normally uses fuzzy or substring<br/>matching.  However, if the header one matches is short, the possibility<br/>for false positives is great, so if the length of the match is less<br/>than this variable, exact matching will be used.<br/><br/>If this variable is nil, exact matching will always be used.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
