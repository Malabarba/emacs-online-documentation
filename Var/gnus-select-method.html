<strong>gnus-select-method</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is (nntp "news")<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Default method for selecting a newsgroup.<br/>
This variable should be a list, where the first element is how the<br/>
news is to be fetched, the second is the address.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if you want to get your news via "flab.flab.edu" using<br/>
NNTP, you could say:<br/>
<br/>
(setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "flab.flab.edu"))<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use your local spool, say:<br/>
<br/>
(setq gnus-select-method (list 'nnspool (system-name)))<br/>
<br/>
If you use this variable, you must set `gnus-nntp-server' to nil.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more to know about select methods and virtual servers -<br/>
see the manual for details.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
