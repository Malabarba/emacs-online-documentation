Provide a limit to what is considered a signature.</br>
If it is a number, no signature may not be longer (in characters) than</br>
that number.  If it is a floating point number, no signature may be</br>
longer (in lines) than that number.  If it is a function, the function</br>
will be called without any parameters, and if it returns nil, there is</br>
no signature in the buffer.  If it is a string, it will be used as a</br>
regexp.  If it matches, the text in question is not a signature.</br>
</br>
This can also be a list of the above values.</br>
