*Groups in which to explicitly send spam-processed articles to<br/>
another group, or expire them (the default).  If non-nil, this should<br/>
be a list of group name regexps that should match all groups in which<br/>
to do spam-processed article moving, associated with the destination<br/>
group or nil for explicit expiration.  This only makes sense for<br/>
mail groups.<br/>
