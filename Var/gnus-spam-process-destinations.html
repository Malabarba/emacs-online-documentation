*Groups in which to explicitly send spam-processed articles to</br>
another group, or expire them (the default).  If non-nil, this should</br>
be a list of group name regexps that should match all groups in which</br>
to do spam-processed article moving, associated with the destination</br>
group or nil for explicit expiration.  This only makes sense for</br>
mail groups.</br>
