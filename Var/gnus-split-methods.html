*Variable used to suggest where articles are to be saved.</br>
For instance, if you would like to save articles related to Gnus in</br>
the file "gnus-stuff", and articles related to VM in "vm-stuff",</br>
you could set this variable to something like:</br>
</br>
 '(("^Subject:.*gnus\|^Newsgroups:.*gnus" "gnus-stuff")</br>
   ("^Subject:.*vm\|^Xref:.*vm" "vm-stuff"))</br>
</br>
This variable is an alist where the key is the match and the</br>
value is a list of possible files to save in if the match is</br>
non-nil.</br>
</br>
If the match is a string, it is used as a regexp match on the</br>
article.  If the match is a symbol, that symbol will be funcalled</br>
from the buffer of the article to be saved with the newsgroup as the</br>
parameter.  If it is a list, it will be evalled in the same buffer.</br>
</br>
If this form or function returns a string, this string will be used as a</br>
possible file name; and if it returns a non-nil list, that list will be</br>
used as possible file names.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
