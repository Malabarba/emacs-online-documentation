*Maximum length of subject comparisons when gathering loose threads.</br>
Use nil to compare full subjects.  Setting this variable to a low</br>
number will help gather threads that have been corrupted by</br>
newsreaders chopping off subject lines, but it might also mean that</br>
unrelated articles that have subject that happen to begin with the</br>
same few characters will be incorrectly gathered.</br>
</br>
If this variable is `fuzzy', Gnus will use a fuzzy algorithm when</br>
comparing subjects.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
