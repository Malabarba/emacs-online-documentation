*If t, many commands will go to the next unread article.</br>
This applies to marking commands as well as other commands that</br>
"naturally" select the next article, like, for instance, `SPC' at</br>
the end of an article.</br>
</br>
If nil, the marking commands do NOT go to the next unread article</br>
(they go to the next article instead).  If `never', commands that</br>
usually go to the next unread article, will go to the next article,</br>
whether it is read or not.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
