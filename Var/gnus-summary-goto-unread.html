Documentation:<br/>
*If t, many commands will go to the next unread article.<br/>
This applies to marking commands as well as other commands that<br/>
"naturally" select the next article, like, for instance, `SPC' at<br/>
the end of an article.<br/>
<br/>
If nil, the marking commands do NOT go to the next unread article<br/>
(they go to the next article instead).  If `never', commands that<br/>
usually go to the next unread article, will go to the next article,<br/>
whether it is read or not.<br/>

You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
