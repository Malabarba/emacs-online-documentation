*The format specification of the lines in the summary buffer.</br>
</br>
It works along the same lines as a normal formatting string,</br>
with some simple extensions.</br>
</br>
%N          Article number, left padded with spaces (string)</br>
%S          Subject (string)</br>

            otherwise (string)</br>
%n          Name of the poster (string)</br>

%M          Message-id of the article (string)</br>
%r          References of the article (string)</br>
%c          Number of characters in the article (integer)</br>
%k          Pretty-printed version of the above (string)</br>
            For example, "1.2k" or "0.4M".</br>
%L          Number of lines in the article (integer)</br>
%I          Indentation based on thread level (a string of</br>
            spaces)</br>
%B          A complex trn-style thread tree (string)</br>
            The variables `gnus-sum-thread-*' can be used for</br>
            customization.</br>
%T          A string with two possible values: 80 spaces if the</br>
            article is on thread level two or larger and 0 spaces</br>
            on level one</br>
%R          "A" if this article has been replied to, " "</br>
            otherwise (character)</br>
%U          "Read" status of this article.</br>
            See Info node `(gnus)Marking Articles'</br>
%[          Opening bracket (character, "[" or "<")</br>
%]          Closing bracket (character, "]" or ">")</br>
%>          Spaces of length thread-level (string)</br>
%<          Spaces of length (- 20 thread-level) (string)</br>
%i          Article score (number)</br>
%z          Article zcore (character)</br>
%t          Number of articles under the current thread (number).</br>
%e          Whether the thread is empty or not (character).</br>
%V          Total thread score (number).</br>
%P          The line number (number).</br>
%O          Download mark (character).</br>
%*          If present, indicates desired cursor position</br>
            (instead of after first colon).</br>
%u          User defined specifier. The next character in the</br>
            format string should be a letter. Gnus will call the</br>
            function gnus-user-format-function-X, where X is the</br>
            letter following %u. The function will be passed the</br>
            current header as argument. The function should</br>
            return a string, which will be inserted into the</br>
            summary just like information from any other summary</br>
            specifier.</br>
&user-date; Age sensitive date format. Various date format is</br>
            defined in `gnus-user-date-format-alist'.</br>
</br>
</br>
The %U (status), %R (replied) and %z (zcore) specs have to be handled</br>
with care.  For reasons of efficiency, Gnus will compute what column</br>
these characters will end up in, and "hard-code" that.  This means that</br>
it is invalid to have these specs after a variable-length spec.  Well,</br>
you might not be arrested, but your summary buffer will look strange,</br>
which is bad enough.</br>
</br>
The smart choice is to have these specs as far to the left as</br>
possible.</br>
</br>
This restriction may disappear in later versions of Gnus.</br>
</br>
General format specifiers can also be used.</br>
