Its value is <pre>adopt</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*nil means that Gnus won't gather loose threads.</br>
If the root of a thread has expired or been read in a previous</br>
session, the information necessary to build a complete thread has been</br>
lost.  Instead of having many small sub-threads from this original thread</br>
scattered all over the summary buffer, Gnus can gather them.</br>
</br>
If non-nil, Gnus will try to gather all loose sub-threads from an</br>
original thread into one large thread.</br>
</br>
If this variable is non-nil, it should be one of `none', `adopt',</br>
`dummy' or `empty'.</br>
</br>
If this variable is `none', Gnus will not make a false root, but just</br>
present the sub-threads after another.</br>
If this variable is `dummy', Gnus will create a dummy root that will</br>
have all the sub-threads as children.</br>
If this variable is `adopt', Gnus will make one of the "children"</br>
the parent and mark all the step-children as such.</br>
If this variable is `empty', the "children" are printed with empty</br>
subject fields.  (Or rather, they will be printed with a string</br>
given by the `gnus-summary-same-subject' variable.)</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
