*List of functions used for sorting threads in the summary buffer.<br/>
By default, threads are sorted by article number.<br/>
<br/>
Each function takes two threads and returns non-nil if the first<br/>
thread should be sorted before the other.  If you use more than one<br/>
function, the primary sort function should be the last.  You should<br/>
probably always include `gnus-thread-sort-by-number' in the list of<br/>
sorting functions -- preferably first.  Also note that sorting by date<br/>
is often much slower than sorting by number, and the sorting order is<br/>
very similar.  (Sorting by date means sorting by the time the message<br/>
was sent, sorting by number means sorting by arrival time.)<br/>
<br/>
Each list item can also be a list `(not F)' where F is a<br/>
function; this specifies reversed sort order.<br/>
<br/>
Ready-made functions include `gnus-thread-sort-by-number',<br/>
`gnus-thread-sort-by-author', `gnus-thread-sort-by-recipient'<br/>
`gnus-thread-sort-by-subject', `gnus-thread-sort-by-date',<br/>
`gnus-thread-sort-by-score', `gnus-thread-sort-by-most-recent-number',<br/>
`gnus-thread-sort-by-most-recent-date', `gnus-thread-sort-by-random',<br/>
and `gnus-thread-sort-by-total-score' (see<br/>
`gnus-thread-score-function').<br/>
<br/>
When threading is turned off, the variable<br/>
`gnus-article-sort-functions' controls how articles are sorted.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
