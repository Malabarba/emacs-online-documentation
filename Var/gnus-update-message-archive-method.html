<strong>gnus-update-message-archive-method</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gnus.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means always update the saved "archive" method.</br>
</br>
The archive method is initially set according to the value of</br>
`gnus-message-archive-method' and is saved in the "~/.newsrc.eld" file</br>
so that it may be used as a real method of the server which is named</br>
"archive" ever since.  If it once has been saved, it will never be</br>
updated if the value of this variable is nil, even if you change the</br>
value of `gnus-message-archive-method' afterward.  If you want the</br>
saved "archive" method to be updated whenever you change the value of</br>
`gnus-message-archive-method', set this variable to a non-nil value.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
