<strong>gud-jdb-directories</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gud.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>(".")</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list of directories that gud jdb should search for source code.</br>
The file names should be absolute, or relative to the current</br>
directory.</br>
</br>
The set of .java files residing in the directories listed are</br>
syntactically analyzed to determine the classes they define and the</br>
packages in which these classes belong.  In this way gud jdb maps the</br>
package-qualified class names output by the jdb debugger to the source</br>
file from which the class originated.  This allows gud mode to keep</br>
the source code display in sync with the debugging session.
