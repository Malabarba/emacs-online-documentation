gud-jdb-directories is a variable defined in `gud.el'.<br/>Its value is (".")<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A list of directories that gud jdb should search for source code.<br/>The file names should be absolute, or relative to the current<br/>directory.<br/><br/>The set of .java files residing in the directories listed are<br/>syntactically analyzed to determine the classes they define and the<br/>packages in which these classes belong.  In this way gud jdb maps the<br/>package-qualified class names output by the jdb debugger to the source<br/>file from which the class originated.  This allows gud mode to keep<br/>the source code display in sync with the debugging session.
