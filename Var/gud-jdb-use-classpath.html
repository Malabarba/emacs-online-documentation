<strong>gud-jdb-use-classpath</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>gud.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, search for Java source files in classpath directories.</br>
The list of directories to search is the value of `gud-jdb-classpath'.</br>
The file pathname is obtained by converting the fully qualified</br>
class information output by jdb to a relative pathname and appending</br>
it to `gud-jdb-classpath' element by element until a match is found.</br>
</br>
This method has a significant jdb startup time reduction advantage</br>
since it does not require the scanning of all `gud-jdb-directories'</br>
and parsing all Java files for class information.</br>
</br>
Set to nil to use `gud-jdb-directories' to scan java sources for</br>
class information on jdb startup (original method).</br>

You can customize this variable.
