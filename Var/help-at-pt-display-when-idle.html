<strong>help-at-pt-display-when-idle</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>help-at-pt.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is never<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Automatically show local help on point-over.<br/>
If the value is t, the string obtained from any `kbd-help' or<br/>
`help-echo' property at point is automatically printed in the<br/>
echo area, if nothing else is already displayed there, or after a<br/>
quit.  If both `kbd-help' and `help-echo' produce help strings,<br/>
`kbd-help' is used.  If the value is a list, the help only gets<br/>
printed if there is a text or overlay property at point that is<br/>
included in this list.  Suggested properties are `keymap',<br/>
`local-map', `button' and `kbd-help'.  Any value other than t or<br/>
a non-empty list disables the feature.<br/>
<br/>
This variable only takes effect after a call to<br/>
`help-at-pt-set-timer'.  The help gets printed after Emacs has<br/>
been idle for `help-at-pt-timer-delay' seconds.  You can call<br/>
`help-at-pt-cancel-timer' to cancel the timer set by, and the<br/>
effect of, `help-at-pt-set-timer'.<br/>
<br/>
When this variable is set through Custom, `help-at-pt-set-timer'<br/>
is called automatically, unless the value is `never', in which<br/>
case `help-at-pt-cancel-timer' is called.  Specifying an empty<br/>
list of properties through Custom will set the timer, thus<br/>
enabling buffer local values.  It sets the actual value to nil.<br/>
Thus, Custom distinguishes between a nil value and other values<br/>
that disable the feature, which Custom identifies with `never'.<br/>
The default is `never'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
