<strong>help-at-pt-timer-delay</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>help-at-pt.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>1</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Delay before displaying local help.</br>
This is used if `help-at-pt-display-when-idle' is enabled.</br>
The value may be an integer or floating point number.</br>
</br>
If a timer is already active, there are two ways to make the new</br>
value take effect immediately.  After setting the value, you can</br>
first call `help-at-pt-cancel-timer' and then set a new timer</br>
with `help-at-pt-set-timer'.  Alternatively, you can set this</br>
variable through Custom.  This will not set a timer if none is</br>
active, but if one is already active, Custom will make it use the</br>
new value.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
