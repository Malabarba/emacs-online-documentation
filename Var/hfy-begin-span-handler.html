Documentation:<br/>
Handler to begin a span of text.<br/>
The signature of the handler is (lambda (STYLE TEXT-BLOCK<br/>
TEXT-ID TEXT-BEGINS-BLOCK-P) ...).  The handler must insert<br/>
appropriate tags to begin a span of text.<br/>
<br/>
STYLE is the name of the style that begins at point.  It is<br/>
derived from the face attributes as part of `hfy-face-to-css'<br/>
callback.  The other arguments TEXT-BLOCK, TEXT-ID,<br/>
TEXT-BEGINS-BLOCK-P are non-nil only if the buffer contains<br/>
invisible text.<br/>
<br/>
TEXT-BLOCK is a string that identifies a single chunk of visible<br/>
or invisible text of which the current position is a part.  For<br/>
visible portions, it's value is "nil". For invisible portions,<br/>
it's value is computed as part of `hfy-invisible-name'.<br/>
<br/>
TEXT-ID marks a unique position within a block.  It is set to<br/>
value of `point' at the current buffer position.<br/>
<br/>
TEXT-BEGINS-BLOCK-P is a boolean and is non-nil if the current<br/>
span also begins a invisible portion of text.<br/>
<br/>
An implementation can use TEXT-BLOCK, TEXT-ID,<br/>
TEXT-BEGINS-BLOCK-P to implement fold/unfold-on-mouse-click like<br/>
behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
The default handler is `hfy-begin-span'.
