Size of area highlighted by hi-lock when font-lock not active.<br/>
Font-lock is not active in buffers that do their own highlighting,<br/>
such as the buffer created by `list-colors-display'.  In those buffers<br/>
hi-lock patterns will only be applied over a range of<br/>
`hi-lock-highlight-range' characters.  If font-lock is active then<br/>
highlighting will be applied throughout the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
