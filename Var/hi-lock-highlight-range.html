Size of area highlighted by hi-lock when font-lock not active.</br>
Font-lock is not active in buffers that do their own highlighting,</br>
such as the buffer created by `list-colors-display'.  In those buffers</br>
hi-lock patterns will only be applied over a range of</br>
`hi-lock-highlight-range' characters.  If font-lock is active then</br>
highlighting will be applied throughout the buffer.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
