<strong>hide-ifdef-expand-reinclusion-protection</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>hideif.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means don't hide an entire header file enclosed by #ifndef...#endif.</br>
Most C/C++ headers are usually wrapped with ifdefs to prevent re-inclusion:</br>
</br>
  ----- beginning of file -----</br>
  #ifndef _XXX_HEADER_FILE_INCLUDED_</br>
  #define _XXX_HEADER_FILE_INCLUDED_</br>
     xxx</br>
     xxx</br>
     xxx...</br>
  #endif</br>
  ----- end of file -----</br>
</br>
The first time we visit such a file, _XXX_HEADER_FILE_INCLUDED_ is</br>
undefined, and so nothing is hidden.  The next time we visit it, everything will</br>
be hidden.</br>
</br>
This behavior is generally undesirable.  If this option is non-nil, the outermost</br>
#if is always visible.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
