<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list of faces used when rotating changes.</br>
Normally the variable is initialized to nil and the list is created from</br>
`highlight-changes-colors' when needed.  However, you can set this variable</br>
to any list of faces.  You will have to do this if you want faces which</br>
don't just differ from the `highlight-changes' face by the foreground color.</br>
Otherwise, this list will be constructed when needed from</br>
`highlight-changes-colors'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
