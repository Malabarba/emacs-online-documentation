<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Maximum length of history lists before truncation takes place.</br>
A number means truncate to that length; truncation deletes old</br>
elements, and is done just after inserting a new element.</br>
A value of t means no truncation.</br>
</br>
This variable only affects history lists that don't specify their own</br>
maximum lengths.  Setting the `history-length' property of a history</br>
variable overrides this default.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
