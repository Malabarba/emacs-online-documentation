<strong>hs-adjust-block-beginning</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>hideshow.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Function used to tweak the block beginning.<br/>
The block is hidden from the position returned by this function,<br/>
as opposed to hiding it from the position returned when searching<br/>
for `hs-block-start-regexp'.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in c-like modes, if we wish to also hide the curly braces<br/>
(if you think they occupy too much space on the screen), this function<br/>
should return the starting point (at the end of line) of the hidden<br/>
region.<br/>
<br/>
It is called with a single argument ARG which is the position in<br/>
buffer after the block beginning.<br/>
<br/>
It should return the position from where we should start hiding.<br/>
<br/>
It should not move the point.<br/>
<br/>
See `hs-c-like-adjust-block-beginning' for an example of using this.
