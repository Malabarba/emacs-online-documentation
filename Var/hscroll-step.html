<strong>hscroll-step</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>0</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
How many columns to scroll the window when point gets too close to the edge.</br>
When point is less than `hscroll-margin' columns from the window</br>
edge, automatic hscrolling will scroll the window by the amount of columns</br>
determined by this variable.  If its value is a positive integer, scroll that</br>
many columns.  If it's a positive floating-point number, it specifies the</br>
fraction of the window's width to scroll.  If it's nil or zero, point will be</br>
centered horizontally after the scroll.  Any other value, including negative</br>
numbers, are treated as if the value were zero.</br>
</br>
Automatic hscrolling always moves point outside the scroll margin, so if</br>
point was more than scroll step columns inside the margin, the window will</br>
scroll more than the value given by the scroll step.</br>
</br>
Note that the lower bound for automatic hscrolling specified by `scroll-left'</br>
and `scroll-right' overrides this variable's effect.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
