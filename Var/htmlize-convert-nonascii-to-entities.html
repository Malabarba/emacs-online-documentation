*Whether non-ASCII characters should be converted to HTML entities.</br>
</br>
When this is non-nil, characters with codes in the 128-255 range will be</br>
considered Latin 1 and rewritten as "&#CODE;".  Characters with codes</br>
above 255 will be converted to "&#UCS;", where UCS denotes the Unicode</br>
code point of the character.  If the code point cannot be determined,</br>
the character will be copied unchanged, as would be the case if the</br>
option were nil.</br>
</br>
When the option is nil, the non-ASCII characters are copied to HTML</br>
without modification.  In that case, the web server and/or the browser</br>
must be set to understand the encoding that was used when saving the</br>
buffer.  (You might also want to specify it by setting</br>
`htmlize-html-charset'.)</br>
</br>
Note that in an HTML entity "&#CODE;", CODE is always a UCS code point,</br>
which has nothing to do with the charset the page is in.  For example,</br>
"&#169;" *always* refers to the copyright symbol, regardless of charset</br>
specified by the META tag or the charset sent by the HTTP server.  In</br>
other words, "&#169;" is exactly equivalent to "&copy;".</br>
</br>
By default, entity conversion is turned on for Mule-enabled Emacsen and</br>
turned off otherwise.  This is because Mule knows the charset of</br>
non-ASCII characters in the buffer.  A non-Mule Emacs cannot tell</br>
whether a character with code 0xA9 represents Latin 1 copyright symbol,</br>
Latin 2 "S with caron", or something else altogether.  Setting this to</br>
t without Mule means asserting that 128-255 characters always mean Latin</br>
1.</br>
</br>
For most people htmlize will work fine with this option left at the</br>
default setting; don't change it unless you know what you're doing.</br>
</br>
