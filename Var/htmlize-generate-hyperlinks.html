*Non-nil means generate the hyperlinks for URLs and mail addresses.</br>
This is on by default; set it to nil if you don't want htmlize to</br>
insert hyperlinks in the resulting HTML.  (In which case you can still</br>
do your own hyperlinkification from htmlize-after-hook.)</br>

You can customize this variable.
