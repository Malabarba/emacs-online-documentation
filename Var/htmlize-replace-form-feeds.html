<strong>htmlize-replace-form-feeds</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>htmlize.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Non-nil means replace form feeds in source code with HTML separators.</br>
Form feeds are the ^L characters at line beginnings that are sometimes</br>
used to separate sections of source code.  If this variable is set to</br>
`t', form feed characters are replaced with the <hr> separator.  If this</br>
is a string, it specifies the replacement to use.  Note that <pre> is</br>
temporarily closed before the separator is inserted, so the default</br>
replacement is effectively "</pre><hr /><pre>".  If you specify</br>
another replacement, don't forget to close and reopen the <pre> if you</br>
want the output to remain valid HTML.</br>
</br>
If you need more elaborate processing, set this to nil and use</br>
htmlize-after-hook.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
