An alist which has special formats used when a filter is active.</br>
The contents of this variable should look like:</br>
 ((FILTER (FORMAT FORMAT ...)) (FILTER (FORMAT FORMAT ...)) ...)</br>
</br>
For example, suppose that when you add a filter for buffers whose</br>
major mode is `emacs-lisp-mode', you only want to see the mark and the</br>
name of the buffer.  You could accomplish that by adding:</br>
 (mode ((mark " " name)))</br>
to this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
