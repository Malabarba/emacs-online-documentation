<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Number of days over which a sexp diary entry is enumerated.</br>
In general sexp entries cannot be translated to icalendar format.</br>
They are therefore enumerated, i.e. explicitly evaluated for a</br>
certain number of days, and then exported.  The enumeration starts</br>
on the current day and continues for the number of days given here.</br>
</br>
See `icalendar-export-sexp-enumerate-all' for a list of sexp</br>
entries which by default are NOT enumerated.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
