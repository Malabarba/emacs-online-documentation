Documentation:<br/>
Icomplete-specific customization of minibuffer setup.<br/>
<br/>
This hook is run during minibuffer setup if icomplete is active.<br/>
It is intended for use in customizing icomplete for interoperation<br/>
with other features and packages.  For instance:<br/>
<br/>
  (add-hook 'icomplete-minibuffer-setup-hook<br/>
	    (function<br/>
	     (lambda ()<br/>
	       (make-local-variable 'max-mini-window-height)<br/>
	       (setq max-mini-window-height 3))))<br/>
<br/>
will constrain Emacs to a maximum minibuffer height of 3 lines when<br/>
icompletion is occurring.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
