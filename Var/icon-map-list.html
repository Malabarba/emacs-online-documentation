The first match is used.<br/>The keys in the alists are file names without extension and with two directory<br/>components.  For example, to map /usr/share/emacs/22.1.1/etc/images/open.xpm<br/>to stock item gtk-open, use:<br/><br/>  ("etc/images/open" . "gtk-open")<br/><br/>Themes also have named icons.  To map to one of those, use n: before the name:<br/><br/>  ("etc/images/diropen" . "n:system-file-manager")<br/><br/>The list elements are either the symbol name for the alist or the<br/>alist itself.<br/><br/>If you don't want stock icons, set the variable to nil.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 22.2 of Emacs.<br/>
