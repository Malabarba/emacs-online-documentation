<strong>idl-font-lock-extra-types</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>cc-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*List of extra types (aside from the type keywords) to recognize in IDL mode.<br/>
Each list item should be a regexp matching a single identifier.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note that items on this list that don't include any regexp special<br/>
characters are automatically optimized using `regexp-opt', so you<br/>
should not use `regexp-opt' explicitly to build regexps here.<br/>
<br/>
On decoration level 3 (and higher, where applicable), a method is used<br/>
that finds most types and declarations by syntax alone.  This variable<br/>
is still used as a first step, but other types are recognized<br/>
correctly anyway in most cases.  Therefore this variable should be<br/>
fairly restrictive and not contain patterns that are uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this variable is only consulted when the major mode is<br/>
initialized.  If you change it later you have to reinitialize CC Mode<br/>
by doing M-x idl-mode.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the name, this variable is not only used for font locking but<br/>
also elsewhere in CC Mode to tell types from other identifiers.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
