<strong>idlwave-abbrev-start-char</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "\\"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
A single character string used to start abbreviations in abbrev mode.<br/>
Possible characters to chose from: ~`%<br/>
or even '?'.  '.' is not a good choice because it can make structure<br/>
field names act like abbrevs in certain circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Changes to this in `idlwave-mode-hook' will have no effect.  Instead a user<br/>
must set it directly using `setq' in the init file before idlwave.el<br/>
is loaded.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
