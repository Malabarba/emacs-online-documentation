idlwave-buffer-case-takes-precedence is a variable defined in `idlwave.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means, the case of tokens in buffers dominates over system stuff.<br/>To make this possible, we need to re-case everything each time we update<br/>the routine info from the buffers.  This is slow.<br/>The default is to consider the case given in the system and library files<br/>first which makes updating much faster.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
