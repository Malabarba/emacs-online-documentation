Association list setting the case of completed words.</br>
</br>
This variable determines the case (UPPER/lower/Capitalized...) of</br>
words inserted into the buffer by completion.  The preferred case can</br>
be specified separately for routine names, keywords, classes and</br>
methods.</br>
This alist should therefore have entries for `routine' (normal</br>
functions and procedures, i.e. non-methods), `keyword', `class', and</br>
`method'.  Plausible values are</br>
</br>
upcase      upcase whole word, like `BOX_CURSOR'</br>
downcase    downcase whole word, like `read_ppm'</br>
capitalize  capitalize each part, like `Widget_Control'</br>
preserve    preserve case as is, like `IDLgrView'</br>
</br>
The value can also be any Emacs Lisp function which transforms the</br>
case of characters in a string.</br>
</br>
A value of `preserve' means that the case of the completed word is</br>
identical to the way it was written in the definition statement of the</br>
routine.  This was implemented to allow for mixed-case completion, in</br>
particular of object classes and methods.</br>
If a completable word is defined in multiple locations, the meaning of</br>
`preserve' is not unique since the different definitions might be</br>
cased differently.  Therefore IDLWAVE always takes the case of the</br>
*first* definition it encounters during routine info collection and</br>
uses the case derived from it consistently.</br>
</br>
Note that a lowercase-only string in the buffer will always be completed in</br>
lower case (but see the variable `idlwave-completion-force-default-case').</br>
</br>
After changing this variable, you need to either restart Emacs or press</br>
`C-u C-c C-i' to update the internal lists.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
