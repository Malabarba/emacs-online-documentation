idlwave-extra-help-function is a variable defined in `idlw-help.el'.<br/>Its value is idlwave-help-with-source<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>The function to call for online help if the normal help fails.<br/>Online help works only for system routines which are described in the<br/>IDL manuals.  A function may be specified to access help from other sources.<br/><br/>The function must accept four arguments: NAME, TYPE, CLASS, KEYWORD.<br/>The Help buffer is current when this function is called, and the help<br/>text should be loaded into this buffer.  If help is found, the<br/>function should return the buffer position which should be used as<br/>`window-start' in the help window.  Also, the variable<br/>`idlwave-help-mode-line-indicator' should be set to a useful string,<br/>which will be displayed in the mode line of the help window.  If<br/>should also set the variable `idlwave-help-min-frame-width' to a<br/>positive integer.  IDLWAVE will ensure that the help frame is at least<br/>that many columns wide.  Failure to find help should be indicated by<br/>throwing an error.<br/><br/>When this variable is non-nil, IDLWAVE will allow the mouse-3 help click<br/>for every routine and keyword, even though the item may not be highlighted<br/>in blue (indicating the availability of system documentation).<br/><br/>The default value for this function is `idlwave-help-with-source' which<br/>loads the routine source file into the help buffer.  If you try to write<br/>a different function which accesses a special help file or so, it is<br/>probably a good idea to still call this function as a fallback.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
