Its value is <pre>idlwave-help-with-source</pre></br>

The function to call for online help if the normal help fails.</br>
Online help works only for system routines which are described in the</br>
IDL manuals.  A function may be specified to access help from other sources.</br>
</br>
The function must accept four arguments: NAME, TYPE, CLASS, KEYWORD.</br>
The Help buffer is current when this function is called, and the help</br>
text should be loaded into this buffer.  If help is found, the</br>
function should return the buffer position which should be used as</br>
`window-start' in the help window.  Also, the variable</br>
`idlwave-help-mode-line-indicator' should be set to a useful string,</br>
which will be displayed in the mode line of the help window.  If</br>
should also set the variable `idlwave-help-min-frame-width' to a</br>
positive integer.  IDLWAVE will ensure that the help frame is at least</br>
that many columns wide.  Failure to find help should be indicated by</br>
throwing an error.</br>
</br>
When this variable is non-nil, IDLWAVE will allow the mouse-3 help click</br>
for every routine and keyword, even though the item may not be highlighted</br>
in blue (indicating the availability of system documentation).</br>
</br>
The default value for this function is `idlwave-help-with-source' which</br>
loads the routine source file into the help buffer.  If you try to write</br>
a different function which accesses a special help file or so, it is</br>
probably a good idea to still call this function as a fallback.</br>
</br>
