<strong>idlwave-init-rinfo-when-idle-after</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 10<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Seconds of idle time before routine info is automatically initialized.<br/>
Initializing the routine info can take a long time, in particular if a<br/>
large number of library catalogs are involved.  When Emacs is idle for<br/>
more than the number of seconds specified by this variable, it starts<br/>
the initialization.  The process is split into five steps, in order to<br/>
keep work interruption as short as possible.  If one of the steps<br/>
finishes, and no user input has arrived in the mean time, initialization<br/>
proceeds immediately to the next step.  A good value for this variable<br/>
is about 1/3 of the time initialization take in your setup.  So if you<br/>
have a fast machine and no problems with a slow network connection,<br/>
don't hesitate to set this to 2 seconds.  A value of 0 means, don't<br/>
initialize automatically, but instead wait until routine information is<br/>
needed, and initialize then.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
