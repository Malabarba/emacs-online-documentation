<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Seconds of idle time before routine info is automatically initialized.</br>
Initializing the routine info can take a long time, in particular if a</br>
large number of library catalogs are involved.  When Emacs is idle for</br>
more than the number of seconds specified by this variable, it starts</br>
the initialization.  The process is split into five steps, in order to</br>
keep work interruption as short as possible.  If one of the steps</br>
finishes, and no user input has arrived in the mean time, initialization</br>
proceeds immediately to the next step.  A good value for this variable</br>
is about 1/3 of the time initialization take in your setup.  So if you</br>
have a fast machine and no problems with a slow network connection,</br>
don't hesitate to set this to 2 seconds.  A value of 0 means, don't</br>
initialize automatically, but instead wait until routine information is</br>
needed, and initialize then.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
