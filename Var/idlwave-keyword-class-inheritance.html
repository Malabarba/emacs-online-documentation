List of regular expressions for class-driven keyword inheritance.</br>
Keyword inheritance is often tied to class inheritance by "chaining"</br>
up the class tree.  While it cannot be assumed that the presence of an</br>
_EXTRA or _REF_EXTRA symbol guarantees such chaining will occur, for</br>
certain methods this assumption is almost always true.  The methods</br>
for which to assume this can be set here.</br>
