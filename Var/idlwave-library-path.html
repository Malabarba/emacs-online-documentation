idlwave-library-path is a variable defined in `idlwave.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Library path for Windows and MacOS (OS9).  Not needed under UNIX.<br/>When selecting the directories to scan for IDL user catalog routine<br/>info, IDLWAVE can, under UNIX, query the shell for the exact search<br/>path (the value of !PATH).  However, under Windows and MacOS<br/>(pre-OSX), the IDLWAVE shell does not work.  In this case, this<br/>variable can be set to specify the paths where IDLWAVE can find PRO<br/>files.  The shell will only be asked for a list of paths when this<br/>variable is nil.  The value is a list of directories.  A directory<br/>preceded by a `+' will be searched recursively.  If you set this<br/>variable on a UNIX system, the shell will not be queried.  See also<br/>`idlwave-system-directory'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
