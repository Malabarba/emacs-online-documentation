Documentation:<br/>
Maximum additional indentation for special continuation indent.<br/>
Several special indentations are tried to help line up continuation<br/>
lines in routine calls or definitions, other statements with<br/>
parentheses, or assignment statements.  This variable specifies a<br/>
maximum amount by which this special indentation can exceed the<br/>
standard continuation indentation, otherwise defaulting to a fixed<br/>
offset.  Set to 0 to effectively disable all special continuation<br/>
indentation, or to a large number (like 100) to enable it in all<br/>
cases.  See also `idlwave-indent-to-open-paren', which can override<br/>
this variable.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
