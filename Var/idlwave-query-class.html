Association list governing specification of object classes for completion.<br/>
<br/>
When IDLWAVE tries to complete object-oriented methods, it usually<br/>
cannot determine the class of a given object from context.  In order<br/>
to provide the user with a correct list of methods or keywords, it<br/>
needs to determine the appropriate class.  IDLWAVE has two ways of<br/>
doing this (well, three ways if you count the shell... see<br/>
`idlwave-shell-query-for-class'):<br/>
<br/>
1. Combine the items of all available classes which contain this<br/>
   method for the purpose of completion.  So when completing a method,<br/>
   all methods of all known classes are available, and when completing<br/>
   a keyword, all keywords allowed for this method in any class are<br/>
   shown.  This behavior is very much like normal completion and is<br/>
   therefore the default.  It works much better than one might think -<br/>
   only for the INIT, GETPROPERTY and SETPROPERTY the keyword lists<br/>
   become uncomfortably long.  See also<br/>
   `idlwave-completion-show-classes'.<br/>
<br/>
2. The second possibility is to ask the user on each occasion.  To<br/>
   make this less interruptive, IDLWAVE can store the class as a text<br/>
   property on the object operator `->'.  For a given object in the<br/>
   source code, class selection will then be needed only once<br/>
   - for example to complete the method.  Keywords to the method can<br/>
   then be completed directly, because the class is already known.<br/>
   You will have to turn on the storage of the selected class<br/>
   explicitly with the variable `idlwave-store-inquired-class'.<br/>
<br/>
This variable allows you to configure IDLWAVE's method and<br/>
method-keyword completion behavior.  Its value is an alist, which<br/>
should contain at least two elements: (method-default . VALUE) and<br/>
(keyword-default . VALUE), where VALUE is either t or nil.  These<br/>
specify if the class should be found during method and keyword<br/>
completion, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The alist may have additional entries specifying exceptions from the<br/>
keyword completion rule for specific methods, like INIT or<br/>
GETPROPERTY.  In order to turn on class specification for the INIT<br/>
method, add an entry ("INIT" . t).  The method name must be ALL-CAPS.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
