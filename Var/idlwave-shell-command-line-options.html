A list of command line options for calling the IDL program.</br>
Since IDL is executed directly without going through a shell like /bin/sh,</br>
this should be a list of strings like '("-rt=file" "-nw") with a separate</br>
string for each argument.  But you may also give a single string which</br>
contains the options whitespace-separated.  Emacs will be kind enough to</br>
split it for you.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
