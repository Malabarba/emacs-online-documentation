<strong>idlwave-shell-mark-stop-line</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>idlw-shell.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, mark the source code line where IDL is currently stopped.</br>
Value decides about the method which is used to mark the line.  Valid values</br>
are:</br>
</br>
nil       Do not mark the line</br>
'arrow    Use the overlay arrow</br>
'face     Use `idlwave-shell-stop-line-face' to highlight the line.</br>
t         Use what IDLWAVE thinks is best.  Will be a face where possible,</br>
          otherwise the overlay arrow.</br>
The overlay-arrow has the disadvantage to hide the first chars of a line.</br>
Since many people do not have the main block of IDL programs indented,</br>
a face highlighting may be better.</br>
In Emacs 21, the overlay arrow is displayed in a special area and never</br>
hides any code, so setting this to 'arrow on Emacs 21 sounds like a good idea.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
