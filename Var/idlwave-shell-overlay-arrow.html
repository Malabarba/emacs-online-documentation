</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The overlay arrow to display at source lines where execution halts.</br>
We use a single character by default, since the main block of IDL procedures</br>
often has no indentation.  Where possible, IDLWAVE will use overlays to</br>
display the stop-lines.  The arrow is only used on character-based terminals.</br>
