Alist of regular expressions matching special library directories.</br>
When listing routine source locations, IDLWAVE gives a short hint where</br>
the file defining the routine is located.  By default it lists `SystemLib'</br>
for routines in the system library `!DIR/lib' and `Library' for anything</br>
else.  This variable can define additional types.  The car of each entry</br>
is a regular expression matching the file name (they normally will match</br>
on the path).  The cdr is the string to be used as identifier.  Max 10</br>
chars are allowed.</br>

You can customize this variable.
