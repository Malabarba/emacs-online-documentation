Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, store class of a method call as text property on `->'.</br>
IDLWAVE sometimes has to ask the user for the class associated with a</br>
particular object method call.  This happens during the commands</br>
`idlwave-routine-info' and `idlwave-complete', depending upon the</br>
value of the variable `idlwave-query-class'.</br>
</br>
When you specify a class, this information can be stored as a text</br>
property on the `->' arrow in the source code, so that during the same</br>
editing session, IDLWAVE will not have to ask again.  When this</br>
variable is non-nil, IDLWAVE will store and reuse the class information.</br>
The class stored can be checked and removed with `M-x idlwave-routine-info'</br>
on the arrow.</br>
</br>
The default of this variable is nil, since the result of commands then</br>
is more predictable.  However, if you know what you are doing, it can</br>
be nice to turn this on.</br>
</br>
An arrow which knows the class will be highlighted with</br>
`idlwave-class-arrow-face'.  The command M-x idlwave-routine-info</br>
displays (with prefix arg: deletes) the class stored on the arrow</br>
at point.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
