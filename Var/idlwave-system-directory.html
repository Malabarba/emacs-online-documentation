<strong>idlwave-system-directory</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>idlwave.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>""</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The IDL system directory for Windows and MacOS.  Not needed under</br>
UNIX.  Set this to the value of the `!DIR' system variable in IDL.</br>
IDLWAVE uses this to find out which of the library routines belong to</br>
the official system library.  All files inside the `lib' subdirectory</br>
are considered system library files - so don't install private stuff</br>
in this directory.  On UNIX systems, IDLWAVE queries the shell for the</br>
value of `!DIR'.  See also `idlwave-library-path'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
