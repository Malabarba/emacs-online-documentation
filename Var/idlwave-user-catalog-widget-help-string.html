"This is the front-end to the creation of the IDLWAVE user catalog.\nPlease select the directories on IDL's search path from which you\nwould like to extract routine information, to be stored in the file:\n\n             %s\n\nIf this is not the correct file, first set variable\n`idlwave-user-catalog-file', and call this command again.\n\nN.B. Many libraries include pre-scanned catalog files\n(\".idlwave_catalog\").  These are marked with \"[LIB]\", and need\nnot be scanned.  You can scan your own libraries off-line using the\nperl script `idlwave_catalog'.\n\nAfter selecting the directories, choose [Scan & Save] to scan the library\ndirectories and save the routine info.\n\n"</pre></br>
