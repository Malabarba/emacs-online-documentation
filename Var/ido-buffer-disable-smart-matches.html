Non-nil means not to re-order matches for buffer switching.</br>
By default, Ido arranges matches in the following order:</br>
</br>
  full-matches > suffix matches > prefix matches > remaining matches</br>

which can get in the way for buffer switching.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
