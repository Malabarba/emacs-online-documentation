<strong>ido-max-dir-file-cache</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ido.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>100</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Maximum number of working directories to be cached.</br>
</br>
Uses keymap `ido-file-completion-map', which is not currently defined.</br>
</br>
This is the size of the cache of `file-name-all-completions' results.</br>
Each cache entry is time stamped with the modification time of the</br>
directory.  Some systems, like Windows, have unreliable directory</br>
modification times, so you may choose to disable caching on such</br>
systems, or explicitly refresh the cache contents using the command</br>
`ido-reread-directory' command (M-x ido-reread-directory) in the minibuffer.</br>
See also `ido-dir-file-cache' and `ido-save-directory-list-file'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
