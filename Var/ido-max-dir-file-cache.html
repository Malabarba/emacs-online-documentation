<strong>ido-max-dir-file-cache</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ido.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 100<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Maximum number of working directories to be cached.<br/>
This is the size of the cache of `file-name-all-completions' results.<br/>
Each cache entry is time stamped with the modification time of the<br/>
directory.  Some systems, like Windows, have unreliable directory<br/>
modification times, so you may choose to disable caching on such<br/>
systems, or explicitly refresh the cache contents using the command<br/>
`ido-reread-directory' command (C-l) in the minibuffer.<br/>
See also `ido-dir-file-cache' and `ido-save-directory-list-file'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
