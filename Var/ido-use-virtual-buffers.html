<strong>ido-use-virtual-buffers</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ido.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, refer to past ("virtual") buffers as well as existing ones.</br>
The options are:</br>
  nil:  Do not use virtual buffers.</br>
  t:    Always use virtual buffers.</br>
  auto: Use virtual buffers if the current input matches no existing buffer.</br>
</br>
Essentially it works as follows: Say you are visiting a file and</br>
the buffer gets cleaned up by midnight.el.  Later, you want to</br>
switch to that buffer, but find it's no longer open.  With virtual</br>
buffers enabled, the buffer name stays in the buffer list (using</br>
the `ido-virtual' face, and always at the end), and if you select</br>
it, it opens the file back up again.  This allows you to think</br>
less about whether recently opened files are still open or not.</br>
Most of the time you can quit Emacs, restart, and then switch to</br>
a file buffer that was previously open as if it still were.</br>
</br>
This feature relies upon the `recentf' package, which will be</br>
enabled if this variable is configured to a non-nil value.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
