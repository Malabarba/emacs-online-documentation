ido-use-virtual-buffers is a variable defined in `ido.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, refer to past buffers as well as existing ones.<br/>Essentially it works as follows: Say you are visiting a file and<br/>the buffer gets cleaned up by midnight.el.  Later, you want to<br/>switch to that buffer, but find it's no longer open.  With<br/>virtual buffers enabled, the buffer name stays in the buffer<br/>list (using the `ido-virtual' face, and always at the end), and if<br/>you select it, it opens the file back up again.  This allows you<br/>to think less about whether recently opened files are still open<br/>or not.  Most of the time you can quit Emacs, restart, and then<br/>switch to a file buffer that was previously open as if it still<br/>were.<br/>    This feature relies upon the `recentf' package, which will be<br/>enabled if this variable is configured to a non-nil value.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
