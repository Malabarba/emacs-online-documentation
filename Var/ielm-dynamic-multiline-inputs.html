<strong>ielm-dynamic-multiline-inputs</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ielm.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Force multiline inputs to start from column zero?<br/>
If non-nil, after entering the first line of an incomplete sexp, a newline<br/>
will be inserted after the prompt, moving the input to the next line.<br/>
This gives more frame width for large indented sexps, and allows functions<br/>
such as `edebug-defun' to work with such inputs.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
