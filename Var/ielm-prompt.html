ielm-prompt is a variable defined in `ielm.el'.<br/>Its value is "ELISP> "<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Prompt used in IELM.<br/>Setting this variable does not affect existing IELM runs.<br/><br/>Interrupting the IELM process with M-x comint-interrupt-subjob,<br/>and then restarting it using M-x ielm, makes the then current<br/>default value affect _new_ prompts.  Unless the new prompt<br/>differs only in text properties from the old one, IELM will no<br/>longer recognize the old prompts.  However, executing M-x ielm<br/>does not update the prompt of an *ielm* buffer with a running process.<br/>For IELM buffers that are not called `*ielm*', you can execute<br/>M-x inferior-emacs-lisp-mode in that IELM buffer to update the value,<br/>for new prompts.  This works even if the buffer has a running process.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
