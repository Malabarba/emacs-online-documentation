Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

If non-nil, standard functions ignore window parameters.</br>
The functions currently affected by this are `split-window',</br>
`delete-window', `delete-other-windows' and `other-window'.</br>
</br>
An application may bind this to a non-nil value around calls to</br>
these functions to inhibit processing of window parameters.
