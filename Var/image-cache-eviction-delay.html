<strong>image-cache-eviction-delay</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>300</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Maximum time after which images are removed from the cache.</br>
When an image has not been displayed this many seconds, Emacs</br>
automatically removes it from the image cache.  If the cache contains</br>
a large number of images, the actual eviction time may be shorter.</br>
The value can also be nil, meaning the cache is never cleared.</br>
</br>
The function `clear-image-cache' disregards this variable.
