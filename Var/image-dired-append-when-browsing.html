Documentation:<br/>
Append thumbnails in thumbnail buffer when browsing.<br/>
If non-nil, using `image-dired-next-line-and-display' and<br/>
`image-dired-previous-line-and-display' will leave a trail of thumbnail<br/>
images in the thumbnail buffer.  If you enable this and want to clean<br/>
the thumbnail buffer because it is filled with too many thumbnails,<br/>
just call `image-dired-display-thumb' to display only the image at point.<br/>
This value can be toggled using `image-dired-toggle-append-browsing'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
