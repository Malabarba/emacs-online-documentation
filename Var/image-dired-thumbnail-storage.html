How to store image-dired's thumbnail files.</br>
Image-Dired can store thumbnail files in one of two ways and this is</br>
controlled by this variable.  "Use image-dired dir" means that the</br>
thumbnails are stored in a central directory.  "Per directory"</br>
means that each thumbnail is stored in a subdirectory called</br>
".image-dired" in the same directory where the image file is.</br>
"Thumbnail Managing Standard" means that the thumbnails are</br>
stored and generated according to the Thumbnail Managing Standard</br>
that allows sharing of thumbnails across different programs.</br>
