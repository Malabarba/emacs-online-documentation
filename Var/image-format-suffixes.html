An alist associating image types with file name suffixes.</br>
This is used as a hint by the ImageMagick library when detecting</br>
the type of image data (that does not have an associated file name).</br>
Each element has the form (MIME-CONTENT-TYPE EXTENSION).</br>
If `create-image' is called with a :format attribute whose value</br>
equals a content-type found in this list, the ImageMagick library is</br>
told that the data would have the associated suffix if saved to a file.
