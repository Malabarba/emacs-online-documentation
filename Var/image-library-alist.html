Documentation:<br/>
Alist of dynamic libraries vs external files implementing them.<br/>
Each element is a list (LIBRARY FILE...), where the car is a symbol<br/>
representing a supported external library, and the rest are strings giving<br/>
alternate filenames for that library.<br/>
<br/>
Emacs tries to load the library from the files in the order they appear on<br/>
the list; if none is loaded, the running session of Emacs won't have access<br/>
to that library.<br/>
<br/>
Note that image types `pbm' and `xbm' do not need entries in this variable<br/>
because they do not depend on external libraries and are always available.<br/>
<br/>
Also note that this is not a generic facility for accessing external<br/>
libraries; only those already known by Emacs will be loaded.
