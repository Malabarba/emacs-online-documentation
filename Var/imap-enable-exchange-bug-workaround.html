imap-enable-exchange-bug-workaround is a variable defined in `imap.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Send FETCH UID commands as *:* instead of *.<br/><br/>When non-nil, use an alternative UIDS form.  Enabling appears to<br/>be required for some servers (e.g., Microsoft Exchange 2007)<br/>which otherwise would trigger a response 'BAD The specified<br/>message set is invalid.'.  We don't unconditionally use this<br/>form, since this is said to be significantly inefficient.<br/><br/>This variable is set to t automatically per server if the<br/>canonical form fails.
