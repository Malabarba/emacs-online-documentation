Value for `process-connection-type' to use for Kerberos4, GSSAPI, shell, and SSL.</br>
The `process-connection-type' variable controls the type of device</br>
used to communicate with subprocesses.  Values are nil to use a</br>
pipe, or t or `pty' to use a pty.  The value has no effect if the</br>
system has no ptys or if all ptys are busy: then a pipe is used</br>
in any case.  The value takes effect when an IMAP server is</br>
opened; changing it after that has no effect.</br>
