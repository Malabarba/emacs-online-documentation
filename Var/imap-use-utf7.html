<strong>imap-use-utf7</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>imap.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, do utf7 encoding/decoding of mailbox names.</br>
Since the UTF7 decoding currently only decodes into ISO-8859-1</br>
characters, you may disable this decoding if you need to access UTF7</br>
encoded mailboxes which doesn't translate into ISO-8859-1.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
