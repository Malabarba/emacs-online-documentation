Function to indent the current line.</br>
This function will be called with no arguments.</br>
If it is called somewhere where auto-indentation cannot be done</br>
(e.g. inside a string), the function should simply return `noindent'.</br>
Setting this function is all you need to make TAB indent appropriately.</br>
Don't rebind TAB unless you really need to.
