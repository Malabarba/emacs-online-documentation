inferior-lisp-buffer is a variable defined in `inf-lisp.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*The current inferior-lisp process buffer.<br/><br/>MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT<br/>===========================================================================<br/>To run multiple Lisp processes, you start the first up<br/>with M-x inferior-lisp.  It will be in a buffer named `*inferior-lisp*'.<br/>Rename this buffer with M-x rename-buffer.  You may now start up a new<br/>process with another M-x inferior-lisp.  It will be in a new buffer,<br/>named `*inferior-lisp*'.  You can switch between the different process<br/>buffers with C-x b.<br/><br/>Commands that send text from source buffers to Lisp processes --<br/>like `lisp-eval-defun' or `lisp-show-arglist' -- have to choose a process<br/>to send to, when you have more than one Lisp process around.  This<br/>is determined by the global variable `inferior-lisp-buffer'.  Suppose you<br/>have three inferior Lisps running:<br/>    Buffer              Process<br/>    foo                 inferior-lisp<br/>    bar                 inferior-lisp<2><br/>    *inferior-lisp*     inferior-lisp<3><br/>If you do a M-x lisp-eval-defun command on some Lisp source code,<br/>what process do you send it to?<br/><br/>- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *inferior-lisp*),<br/>  you send it to that process.<br/>- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you<br/>  send it to the process attached to buffer `inferior-lisp-buffer'.<br/>This process selection is performed by function `inferior-lisp-proc'.<br/><br/>Whenever M-x inferior-lisp fires up a new process, it resets<br/>`inferior-lisp-buffer' to be the new process's buffer.  If you only run<br/>one process, this does the right thing.  If you run multiple<br/>processes, you can change `inferior-lisp-buffer' to another process<br/>buffer with M-x set-variable.
