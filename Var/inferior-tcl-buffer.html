MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT<br/>
===========================================================================<br/>
To run multiple Tcl processes, you start the first up with<br/>
M-x inferior-tcl.  It will be in a buffer named `*inferior-tcl*'.<br/>
Rename this buffer with M-x rename-buffer.  You may now start up a new<br/>
process with another M-x inferior-tcl.  It will be in a new buffer,<br/>
named `*inferior-tcl*'.  You can switch between the different process<br/>
buffers with C-x b.<br/>
<br/>
Commands that send text from source buffers to Tcl processes -- like<br/>
`tcl-eval-defun' or `tcl-load-file' -- have to choose a process to<br/>
send to, when you have more than one Tcl process around.  This is<br/>
determined by the global variable `inferior-tcl-buffer'.  Suppose you<br/>
have three inferior Lisps running:<br/>
    Buffer              Process<br/>
    foo                 inferior-tcl<br/>
    bar                 inferior-tcl<2><br/>
    *inferior-tcl*      inferior-tcl<3><br/>
If you do a M-x tcl-eval-defun command on some Lisp source code, what<br/>
process do you send it to?<br/>
<br/>
- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *inferior-tcl*),<br/>
  you send it to that process.<br/>
- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you<br/>
  send it to the process attached to buffer `inferior-tcl-buffer'.<br/>
This process selection is performed by function `inferior-tcl-proc'.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever M-x inferior-tcl fires up a new process, it resets<br/>
`inferior-tcl-buffer' to be the new process's buffer.  If you only run<br/>
one process, this does the right thing.  If you run multiple<br/>
processes, you can change `inferior-tcl-buffer' to another process<br/>
buffer with M-x set-variable.
