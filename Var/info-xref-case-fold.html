<strong>info-xref-case-fold</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>info-xref.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means node checks should ignore case.</br>
When following cross-references, the Emacs Info reader first tries a</br>
case-sensitive match, then if that fails a case-insensitive one.</br>
The standalone Info reader does not do this, nor does this work</br>
for links in the html versions of Texinfo manuals.  Therefore</br>
to ensure your cross-references work on the widest range of platforms,</br>
you should set this variable to nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
