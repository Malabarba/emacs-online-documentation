<strong>inhibit-iso-escape-detection</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, Emacs ignores ISO-2022 escape sequences during code detection.</br>
</br>
When Emacs reads text, it tries to detect how the text is encoded.</br>
This code detection is sensitive to escape sequences.  If Emacs sees</br>
a valid ISO-2022 escape sequence, it assumes the text is encoded in one</br>
of the ISO2022 encodings, and decodes text by the corresponding coding</br>
system (e.g. `iso-2022-7bit').</br>
</br>
However, there may be a case that you want to read escape sequences in</br>
a file as is.  In such a case, you can set this variable to non-nil.</br>
Then the code detection will ignore any escape sequences, and no text is</br>
detected as encoded in some ISO-2022 encoding.  The result is that all</br>
escape sequences become visible in a buffer.</br>
</br>
The default value is nil, and it is strongly recommended not to change</br>
it.  That is because many Emacs Lisp source files that contain</br>
non-ASCII characters are encoded by the coding system `iso-2022-7bit'</br>
in Emacs's distribution, and they won't be decoded correctly on</br>
reading if you suppress escape sequence detection.</br>
</br>
The other way to read escape sequences in a file without decoding is</br>
to explicitly specify some coding system that doesn't use ISO-2022</br>
escape sequence (e.g., `latin-1') on reading by C-x RET c.
