List of regexps matching file names in which to ignore local variables.</br>
This includes `-*-' lines as well as trailing "Local Variables" sections.</br>
Files matching this list are typically binary file formats.</br>
They may happen to contain sequences that look like local variable</br>
specifications, but are not really, or they may be containers for</br>
member files with their own local variable sections, which are</br>
not appropriate for the containing file.</br>
The function `inhibit-local-variables-p' uses this.
