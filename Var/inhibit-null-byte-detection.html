<strong>inhibit-null-byte-detection</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>

If non-nil, Emacs ignores null bytes on code detection.</br>
By default, Emacs treats it as binary data, and does not attempt to</br>
decode it.  The effect is as if you specified `no-conversion' for</br>
reading that text.</br>
</br>
Set this to non-nil when a regular text happens to include null bytes.</br>
Examples are Index nodes of Info files and null-byte delimited output</br>
from GNU Find and GNU Grep.  Emacs will then ignore the null bytes and</br>
decode text as usual.
