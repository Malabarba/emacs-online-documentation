<strong>init-file-user</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>startup.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Identity of user whose init file is or was read.<br/>
The value is nil if `-q' or `--no-init-file' was specified,<br/>
meaning do not load any init file.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the value may be an empty string, meaning<br/>
use the init file for the user who originally logged in,<br/>
or it may be a string containing a user's name meaning<br/>
use that person's init file.<br/>
<br/>
In either of the latter cases, `(concat "~" init-file-user "/")'<br/>
evaluates to the name of the directory where the init file was<br/>
looked for.<br/>
<br/>
Setting `init-file-user' does not prevent Emacs from loading<br/>
`site-start.el'.  The only way to do that is to use `--no-site-file'.
