Buffer to show after starting Emacs.</br>
If the value is nil and `inhibit-startup-screen' is nil, show the</br>
startup screen.  If the value is a string, switch to a buffer</br>
visiting the file or directory specified by that string.  If the</br>
value is a function, switch to the buffer returned by that</br>
function.  If t, open the `*scratch*' buffer.</br>

or directory when no target file is specified.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
