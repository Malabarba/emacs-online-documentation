Buffer to show after starting Emacs.</br>
If the value is nil and `inhibit-startup-screen' is nil, show the</br>
startup screen.  If the value is a string, switch to a buffer</br>
visiting the file or directory that the string specifies.  If the</br>
value is a function, call it with no arguments and switch to the buffer</br>
that it returns.  If t, open the `*scratch*' buffer.</br>

If you use `emacsclient' with no target file, then it obeys any</br>
string or function value that this variable has.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
