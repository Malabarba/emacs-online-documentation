Its value is <pre>(keymap)</pre></br>
It is a terminal-local variable; global value is the same.</br>

Keymap that decodes input escape sequences.</br>
This is used mainly for mapping ASCII function key sequences into</br>
real Emacs function key events (symbols).</br>
</br>
The `read-key-sequence' function replaces any subsequence bound by</br>
`input-decode-map' with its binding.  Contrary to `function-key-map',</br>
this map applies its rebinding regardless of the presence of an ordinary</br>
binding.  So it is more like `key-translation-map' except that it applies</br>
before `function-key-map' rather than after.</br>
</br>
If the binding is a function, it is called with one argument (the prompt)</br>
and its return value (a key sequence) is used.</br>
</br>
The events that come from bindings in `input-decode-map' are not</br>
themselves looked up in `input-decode-map'.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
