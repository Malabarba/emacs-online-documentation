This flag controls when an input method returns.</br>
Usually, the input method does not return while there's a possibility</br>
that it may find a different translation if a user types another key.</br>
But, if this flag is non-nil, the input method returns as soon as the</br>
current key sequence gets long enough to have some valid translation.
