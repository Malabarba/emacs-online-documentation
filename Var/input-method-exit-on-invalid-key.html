This flag controls the behavior of an input method on invalid key input.</br>
Usually, when a user types a key which doesn't start any character</br>
handled by the input method, the key is handled by turning off the</br>
input method temporarily.  After that key, the input method is re-enabled.</br>
But, if this flag is non-nil, the input method is never back on.
