<strong>input-method-function</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>This variable's value is permanent if it is given a local binding.</li><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, the function that implements the current input method.</br>
It's called with one argument, a printing character that was just read.</br>
(That means a character with code 040...0176.)</br>
Typically this function uses `read-event' to read additional events.</br>
When it does so, it should first bind `input-method-function' to nil</br>
so it will not be called recursively.</br>
</br>
The function should return a list of zero or more events</br>
to be used as input.  If it wants to put back some events</br>
to be reconsidered, separately, by the input method,</br>
it can add them to the beginning of `unread-command-events'.</br>
</br>
The input method function can find in `input-method-previous-message'</br>
the previous echo area message.</br>
</br>
The input method function should refer to the variables</br>
`input-method-use-echo-area' and `input-method-exit-on-first-char'</br>
for guidance on what to do.
