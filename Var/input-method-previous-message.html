<strong>input-method-previous-message</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
When `input-method-function' is called, hold the previous echo area message.<br/>
This variable exists because `read-event' clears the echo area<br/>
before running the input method.  It is nil if there was no message.
