<strong>insert-default-directory</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>minibuffer.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means when reading a filename start with default dir in minibuffer.<br/>
<br/>
When the initial minibuffer contents show a name of a file or a directory,<br/>
typing RETURN without editing the initial contents is equivalent to typing<br/>
the default file name.<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is non-nil, the minibuffer contents are always<br/>
initially non-empty, and typing RETURN without editing will fetch the<br/>
default name, if one is provided.  Note however that this default name<br/>
is not necessarily the same as initial contents inserted in the minibuffer,<br/>
if the initial contents is just the default directory.<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is nil, the minibuffer often starts out empty.  In<br/>
that case you may have to explicitly fetch the next history element to<br/>
request the default name; typing RETURN without editing will leave<br/>
the minibuffer empty.<br/>
<br/>
For some commands, exiting with an empty minibuffer has a special meaning,<br/>
such as making the current buffer visit no file in the case of<br/>
`set-visited-file-name'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
