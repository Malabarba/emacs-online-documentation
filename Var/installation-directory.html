A directory within which to look for the `lib-src' and `etc' directories.</br>
In an installed Emacs, this is normally nil.  It is non-nil if</br>
both `lib-src' (on MS-DOS, `info') and `etc' directories are found</br>
within the variable `invocation-directory' or its parent.  For example,</br>
this is the case when running an uninstalled Emacs executable from its</br>
build directory.
