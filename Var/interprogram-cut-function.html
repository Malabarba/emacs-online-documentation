text between different programs, such as the clipboard on X and</br>
MS-Windows, or the pasteboard on Nextstep/Mac OS.</br>

This variable holds a function that Emacs calls whenever text is</br>
put in the kill ring, to make the new kill available to other</br>
programs.  The function takes one argument, TEXT, which is a</br>
string containing the text which should be made available.
