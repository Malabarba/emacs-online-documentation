Function to call to get text cut from other programs.</br>
Most window systems provide a facility for cutting and pasting</br>
text between different programs, such as the clipboard on X and</br>
MS-Windows, or the pasteboard on Nextstep/Mac OS.</br>
</br>
This variable holds a function that Emacs calls to obtain text</br>
that other programs have provided for pasting.  The function is</br>
called with no arguments.  If no other program has provided text</br>
to paste, the function should return nil (in which case the</br>
caller, usually `current-kill', should use the top of the Emacs</br>
kill ring).  If another program has provided text to paste, the</br>
function should return that text as a string (in which case the</br>
caller should put this string in the kill ring as the latest</br>
kill).</br>
</br>
The function may also return a list of strings if the window</br>
system supports multiple selections.  The first string will be</br>
used as the pasted text, but the other will be placed in the kill</br>
ring for easy access via `yank-pop'.</br>
</br>
Note that the function should return a string only if a program</br>
other than Emacs has provided a string for pasting; if Emacs</br>
provided the most recent string, the function should return nil.</br>
If it is difficult to tell whether Emacs or some other program</br>
provided the current string, it is probably good enough to return</br>
nil if the string is equal (according to `string=') to the last</br>
text Emacs provided.
