This variable makes a difference when `search-invisible' is set to `open'.<br/>
It means that after search makes some invisible text visible<br/>
to show the match, it makes the text invisible again when the match moves.<br/>
Ordinarily the text becomes invisible again at the end of the search.<br/>
