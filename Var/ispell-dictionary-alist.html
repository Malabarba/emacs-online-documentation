<strong>ispell-dictionary-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ispell.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
An alist of dictionaries and their associated parameters.</br>
</br>
Each element of this list is also a list:</br>
</br>
(DICTIONARY-NAME CASECHARS NOT-CASECHARS OTHERCHARS MANY-OTHERCHARS-P</br>
        ISPELL-ARGS EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE CHARACTER-SET)</br>
</br>
DICTIONARY-NAME is a possible string value of variable `ispell-dictionary',</br>
nil means the default dictionary.</br>
</br>
CASECHARS is a regular expression of valid characters that comprise a word.</br>
</br>
NOT-CASECHARS is the opposite regexp of CASECHARS.</br>
</br>
OTHERCHARS is a regexp of characters in the NOT-CASECHARS set but which can be</br>
used to construct words in some special way.  If OTHERCHARS characters follow</br>
and precede characters from CASECHARS, they are parsed as part of a word,</br>
otherwise they become word-breaks.  As an example in English, assume the</br>
regular expression "[']" for OTHERCHARS.  Then "they're" and</br>
"Steven's" are parsed as single words including the "'" character, but</br>
"Stevens'" does not include the quote character as part of the word.</br>
If you want OTHERCHARS to be empty, use the empty string.</br>
Hint: regexp syntax requires the hyphen to be declared first here.</br>
</br>
CASECHARS, NOT-CASECHARS, and OTHERCHARS must be unibyte strings</br>
containing bytes of CHARACTER-SET.  In addition, if they contain</br>
non-ASCII bytes, the regular expression must be a single</br>
`character set' construct that doesn't specify a character range</br>
for non-ASCII bytes.</br>
</br>
MANY-OTHERCHARS-P is non-nil when multiple OTHERCHARS are allowed in a word.</br>
Otherwise only a single OTHERCHARS character is allowed to be part of any</br>
single word.</br>
</br>
ISPELL-ARGS is a list of additional arguments passed to the ispell</br>
subprocess.</br>
</br>
EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE should be used when dictionaries are used which</br>
have been configured in an Ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts</br>
can be encoded as \"a, a\", "a, ...)  Defaults are ~tex and ~nroff</br>
in English.  This has the same effect as the command-line `-T' option.</br>
The buffer Major Mode controls Ispell's parsing in tex or nroff mode,</br>
but the dictionary can control the extended character mode.</br>
Both defaults can be overruled in a buffer-local fashion.  See</br>
`ispell-parsing-keyword' for details on this.</br>
</br>
CHARACTER-SET used to encode text sent to the ispell subprocess</br>
when the language uses non-ASCII characters.</br>
</br>
Note that with "ispell" as the speller, the CASECHARS and</br>
OTHERCHARS slots of the alist should contain the same character</br>
set as casechars and otherchars in the LANGUAGE.aff file (e.g.,</br>
english.aff).  aspell and hunspell don't have this limitation.
