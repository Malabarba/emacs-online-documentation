<strong>ispell-local-pdict</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ispell.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>
  satisfies the predicate `stringp'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
A buffer local variable containing the current personal dictionary.<br/>
If non-nil, the value must be a string, which is a file name.<br/>
<br/>
If you specify a personal dictionary for the current buffer which is<br/>
different from the current personal dictionary, the effect is similar<br/>
to calling M-x ispell-change-dictionary.  This variable is automatically<br/>
set when defined in the file with either `ispell-pdict-keyword' or the<br/>
local variable syntax.
