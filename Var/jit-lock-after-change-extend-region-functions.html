jit-lock-after-change-extend-region-functions is a variable defined in `jit-lock.el'.<br/>Its value is (font-lock-extend-jit-lock-region-after-change t)<br/>Local in buffer *scratch*; global value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hook that can extend the text to refontify after a change.<br/>This is run after every buffer change.  The functions are called with<br/>the three arguments of `after-change-functions': START END OLD-LEN.<br/>The extended region to refontify is returned indirectly by modifying<br/>the variables `jit-lock-start' and `jit-lock-end'.<br/><br/>Note that extending the region this way is not strictly necessary, except<br/>that the nature of the redisplay code tends to otherwise leave some of<br/>the rehighlighted text displayed with the old highlight until the next<br/>redisplay (see comment about repeated redisplay in `jit-lock-fontify-now').
