Hook that can extend the text to refontify after a change.</br>
This is run after every buffer change.  The functions are called with</br>
the three arguments of `after-change-functions': START END OLD-LEN.</br>
The extended region to refontify is returned indirectly by modifying</br>
the variables `jit-lock-start' and `jit-lock-end'.</br>
</br>
Note that extending the region this way is not strictly necessary, except</br>
that the nature of the redisplay code tends to otherwise leave some of</br>
the rehighlighted text displayed with the old highlight until the next</br>
redisplay (see comment about repeated redisplay in `jit-lock-fontify-now').
