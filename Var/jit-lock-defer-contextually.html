If non-nil, means fontification should be syntactically true.</br>
If nil, means fontification occurs only on those lines modified.  This</br>
means where modification on a line causes syntactic change on subsequent lines,</br>
those subsequent lines are not refontified to reflect their new context.</br>
If t, means fontification occurs on those lines modified and all</br>
subsequent lines.  This means those subsequent lines are refontified to reflect</br>
their new syntactic context, after `jit-lock-context-time' seconds.</br>
If any other value, e.g., `syntax-driven', means syntactically true</br>
fontification occurs only if syntactic fontification is performed using the</br>
buffer mode's syntax table, i.e., only if `font-lock-keywords-only' is nil.</br>
</br>
The value of this variable is used when JIT Lock mode is turned on.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
