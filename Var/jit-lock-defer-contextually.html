jit-lock-defer-contextually is a variable defined in `jit-lock.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/>Local in buffer doc-to-html.el; global value is syntax-driven<br/><br/>  This variable is an alias for `jit-lock-contextually'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, means fontification should be syntactically true.<br/>If nil, means fontification occurs only on those lines modified.  This<br/>means where modification on a line causes syntactic change on subsequent lines,<br/>those subsequent lines are not refontified to reflect their new context.<br/>If t, means fontification occurs on those lines modified and all<br/>subsequent lines.  This means those subsequent lines are refontified to reflect<br/>their new syntactic context, after `jit-lock-context-time' seconds.<br/>If any other value, e.g., `syntax-driven', means syntactically true<br/>fontification occurs only if syntactic fontification is performed using the<br/>buffer mode's syntax table, i.e., only if `font-lock-keywords-only' is nil.<br/><br/>The value of this variable is used when JIT Lock mode is turned on.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
