<strong>jit-lock-stealth-load</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>jit-lock.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>200</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Load in percentage above which stealth fontification is suspended.</br>
Stealth fontification pauses when the system short-term load average (as</br>
returned by the function `load-average' if supported) goes above this level,</br>
thus reducing the demand that stealth fontification makes on the system.</br>
If nil, means stealth fontification is never suspended.</br>
To reduce machine load during stealth fontification, at the cost of stealth</br>
taking longer to fontify, you could reduce the value of this variable.</br>
See also `jit-lock-stealth-nice'.</br>

You can customize this variable.
