Time in seconds to pause between chunks of stealth fontification.</br>
Each iteration of stealth fontification is separated by this amount of time,</br>
thus reducing the demand that stealth fontification makes on the system.</br>
If nil, means stealth fontification is never paused.</br>
To reduce machine load during stealth fontification, at the cost of stealth</br>
taking longer to fontify, you could increase the value of this variable.</br>
See also `jit-lock-stealth-load'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
