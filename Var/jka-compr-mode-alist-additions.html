List of pairs added to `auto-mode-alist' when installing jka-compr.</br>
Uninstalling jka-compr removes all pairs from `auto-mode-alist' that</br>
installing added.</br>
</br>
If you set this outside Custom while Auto Compression mode is</br>
already enabled (as it is by default), you have to call</br>
`jka-compr-update' after setting it to properly update other</br>
variables.  Setting this through Custom does that automatically.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
