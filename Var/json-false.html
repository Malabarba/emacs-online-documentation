<strong>json-false</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>json.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>:json-false</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Value to use when reading JSON `false'.</br>
If this has the same value as `json-null', you might not be able to tell</br>
the difference between `false' and `null'.  Consider let-binding this</br>
around your call to `json-read' instead of `setq'ing it.
