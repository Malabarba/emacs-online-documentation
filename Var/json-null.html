<strong>json-null</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>json.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Value to use when reading JSON `null'.</br>
If this has the same value as `json-false', you might not be able to</br>
tell the difference between `false' and `null'.  Consider let-binding</br>
this around your call to `json-read' instead of `setq'ing it.
