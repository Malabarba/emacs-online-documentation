kill-emacs-hook is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is<br/>(org-babel-remove-temporary-directory reftex-kill-emacs-hook tex-delete-last-temp-files ps-kill-emacs-check ps-run-cleanup bookmark-exit-hook-internal save-place-kill-emacs-hook emacs-lock--kill-emacs-hook desktop-kill)<br/><br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hook run when `kill-emacs' is called.<br/>Since `kill-emacs' may be invoked when the terminal is disconnected (or<br/>in other similar situations), functions placed on this hook should not<br/>expect to be able to interact with the user.  To ask for confirmation,<br/>see `kill-emacs-query-functions' instead.<br/><br/>Before Emacs 24.1, the hook was not run in batch mode, i.e., if<br/>`noninteractive' was non-nil.
