Documentation:<br/>
Hook run when `kill-emacs' is called.<br/>
Since `kill-emacs' may be invoked when the terminal is disconnected (or<br/>
in other similar situations), functions placed on this hook should not<br/>
expect to be able to interact with the user.  To ask for confirmation,<br/>
see `kill-emacs-query-functions' instead.<br/>
<br/>
Before Emacs 24.1, the hook was not run in batch mode, i.e., if<br/>
`noninteractive' was non-nil.
