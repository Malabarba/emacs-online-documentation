Hook run when `kill-emacs' is called.</br>
Since `kill-emacs' may be invoked when the terminal is disconnected (or</br>
in other similar situations), functions placed on this hook should not</br>
expect to be able to interact with the user.  To ask for confirmation,</br>
see `kill-emacs-query-functions' instead.</br>
</br>
Before Emacs 24.1, the hook was not run in batch mode, i.e., if</br>
`noninteractive' was non-nil.
