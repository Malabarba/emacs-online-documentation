Documentation:<br/>
List of killed text sequences.<br/>
Since the kill ring is supposed to interact nicely with cut-and-paste<br/>
facilities offered by window systems, use of this variable should<br/>
interact nicely with `interprogram-cut-function' and<br/>
`interprogram-paste-function'.  The functions `kill-new',<br/>
`kill-append', and `current-kill' are supposed to implement this<br/>
interaction; you may want to use them instead of manipulating the kill<br/>
ring directly.
