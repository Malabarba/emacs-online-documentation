<strong>landmark-one-moment-please</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>landmark.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, print "One moment please" when a new board is generated.<br/>
The drawback of this is you don't see how many moves the last run took<br/>
because it is overwritten by "One moment please".<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
