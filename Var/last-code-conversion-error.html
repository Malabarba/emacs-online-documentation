<strong>last-code-conversion-error</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Error status of the last code conversion.<br/>
<br/>
When an error was detected in the last code conversion, this variable<br/>
is set to one of the following symbols.<br/>
  `insufficient-source'<br/>
  `inconsistent-eol'<br/>
  `invalid-source'<br/>
  `interrupted'<br/>
  `insufficient-memory'<br/>
When no error was detected, the value doesn't change.  So, to check<br/>
the error status of a code conversion by this variable, you must<br/>
explicitly set this variable to nil before performing code<br/>
conversion.
