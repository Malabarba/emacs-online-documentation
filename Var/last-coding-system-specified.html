Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

Most recent coding system explicitly specified by the user when asked.</br>
This variable is set whenever Emacs asks the user which coding system</br>
to use in order to write a file.  If you set it to nil explicitly,</br>
then call `write-region', then afterward this variable will be non-nil</br>
only if the user was explicitly asked and specified a coding system.
