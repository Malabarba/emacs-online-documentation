Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
It is a terminal-local variable; global value is the same.</br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>

The last command executed.</br>
Normally a symbol with a function definition, but can be whatever was found</br>
in the keymap, or whatever the variable `this-command' was set to by that</br>
command.</br>
</br>
The value `mode-exit' is special; it means that the previous command</br>
read an event that told it to exit, and it did so and unread that event.</br>
In other words, the present command is the event that made the previous</br>
command exit.</br>
</br>
The value `kill-region' is special; it means that the previous command</br>
was a kill command.</br>
</br>
`last-command' has a separate binding for each terminal device.</br>
