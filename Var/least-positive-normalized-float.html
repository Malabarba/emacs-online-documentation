least-positive-normalized-float is a variable defined in `cl.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable is an alias for `cl-least-positive-normalized-float'.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>The smallest normalized Lisp float greater than zero.<br/>This is the smallest value for which IEEE denormalization does not lose<br/>precision.  For IEEE machines, this value is about 2.22e-308.<br/>For machines that do not support the concept of denormalization<br/>and gradual underflow, this constant equals `cl-least-positive-float'.<br/>Call `cl-float-limits' to set this.
