The smallest normalized Lisp float greater than zero.</br>
This is the smallest value for which IEEE denormalization does not lose</br>
precision.  For IEEE machines, this value is about 2.22e-308.</br>
For machines that do not support the concept of denormalization</br>
and gradual underflow, this constant equals `cl-least-positive-float'.</br>
Call `cl-float-limits' to set this.
