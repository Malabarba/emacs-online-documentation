<strong>lexical-binding</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li><li>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value</br>
  satisfies the predicate `booleanp'.</li></ul></br>

Whether to use lexical binding when evaluating code.</br>
Non-nil means that the code in the current buffer should be evaluated</br>
with lexical binding.</br>
This variable is automatically set from the file variables of an</br>
interpreted Lisp file read using `load'.  Unlike other file local</br>
variables, this must be set in the first line of a file.
