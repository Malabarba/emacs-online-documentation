<strong>lexical-binding</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>
  satisfies the predicate `booleanp'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Whether to use lexical binding when evaluating code.<br/>
Non-nil means that the code in the current buffer should be evaluated<br/>
with lexical binding.<br/>
This variable is automatically set from the file variables of an<br/>
interpreted Lisp file read using `load'.  Unlike other file local<br/>
variables, this must be set in the first line of a file.
