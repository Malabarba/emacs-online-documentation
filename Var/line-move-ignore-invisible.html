<strong>line-move-ignore-invisible</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means commands that move by lines ignore invisible newlines.</br>
When this option is non-nil, C-n, C-p, C-e, and C-a behave</br>
as if newlines that are invisible didn't exist, and count</br>
only visible newlines.  Thus, moving across across 2 newlines</br>
one of which is invisible will be counted as a one-line move.</br>
Also, a non-nil value causes invisible text to be ignored when</br>
counting columns for the purposes of keeping point in the same</br>
column by C-n and C-p.</br>
</br>
Outline mode sets this.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
