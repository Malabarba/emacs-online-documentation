</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, `line-move' moves point by visual lines.</br>
This movement is based on where the cursor is displayed on the</br>
screen, instead of relying on buffer contents alone.  It takes</br>
into account variable-width characters and line continuation.</br>
If nil, `line-move' moves point by logical lines.</br>
A non-nil setting of `goal-column' overrides the value of this variable</br>
and forces movement by logical lines.</br>
A window that is  horizontally scrolled also forces movement by logical</br>
lines.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
