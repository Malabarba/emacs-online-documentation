list-diary-entries-hook is a variable defined in `diary-lib.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable is an alias for `diary-list-entries-hook'.<br/>  This variable is obsolete since 23.1;<br/>  use `diary-list-entries-hook' instead.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hook run after diary file is culled for relevant entries.<br/><br/>If you add `diary-include-other-diary-files' to this hook, you<br/>will probably also want to add `diary-mark-included-diary-files'<br/>to `diary-mark-entries-hook'.  For example, to cause the fancy<br/>diary buffer to be displayed with diary entries from various<br/>included files, each day's entries sorted into lexicographic<br/>order, add the following to your init file:<br/><br/>     (setq diary-display-function 'diary-fancy-display)<br/>     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-include-other-diary-files)<br/>     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-sort-entries t)<br/><br/>Note how the sort function is placed last, so that it can sort<br/>the entries included from other files.<br/><br/>This hook runs after `diary-nongregorian-listing-hook'.  These two hooks<br/>differ only if you are using included diary files.  In that case,<br/>`diary-nongregorian-listing-hook' runs for each file, whereas<br/>`diary-list-entries-hook' only runs once, for the main diary file.<br/>So for example, to sort the complete list of diary entries you would<br/>use the list-entries hook, whereas to process e.g. Islamic entries in<br/>the main file and all included files, you would use the nongregorian hook.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
