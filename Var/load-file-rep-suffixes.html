<strong>load-file-rep-suffixes</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>("" ".gz")</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of suffixes that indicate representations of the same file.</br>
This list should normally start with the empty string.</br>
</br>
Enabling Auto Compression mode appends the suffixes in</br>
`jka-compr-load-suffixes' to this list and disabling Auto Compression</br>
mode removes them again.  `load' and related functions use this list to</br>
determine whether they should look for compressed versions of a file</br>
and, if so, which suffixes they should try to append to the file name</br>
in order to do so.  However, if you want to customize which suffixes</br>
the loading functions recognize as compression suffixes, you should</br>
customize `jka-compr-load-suffixes' rather than the present variable.
