load-file-rep-suffixes is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is ("" ".gz")<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of suffixes that indicate representations of the same file.<br/>This list should normally start with the empty string.<br/><br/>Enabling Auto Compression mode appends the suffixes in<br/>`jka-compr-load-suffixes' to this list and disabling Auto Compression<br/>mode removes them again.  `load' and related functions use this list to<br/>determine whether they should look for compressed versions of a file<br/>and, if so, which suffixes they should try to append to the file name<br/>in order to do so.  However, if you want to customize which suffixes<br/>the loading functions recognize as compression suffixes, you should<br/>customize `jka-compr-load-suffixes' rather than the present variable.
