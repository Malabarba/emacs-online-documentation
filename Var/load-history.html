<strong>load-history</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is shown <a href="#value">below</a>.</br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist mapping loaded file names to symbols and features.</br>
Each alist element should be a list (FILE-NAME ENTRIES...), where</br>
FILE-NAME is the name of a file that has been loaded into Emacs.</br>
The file name is absolute and true (i.e. it doesn't contain symlinks).</br>
As an exception, one of the alist elements may have FILE-NAME nil,</br>
for symbols and features not associated with any file.</br>
</br>
The remaining ENTRIES in the alist element describe the functions and</br>
variables defined in that file, the features provided, and the</br>
features required.  Each entry has the form `(provide . FEATURE)',</br>
`(require . FEATURE)', `(defun . FUNCTION)', `(autoload . SYMBOL)',</br>
`(defface . SYMBOL)', or `(t . SYMBOL)'.  Entries like `(t . SYMBOL)'</br>
may precede a `(defun . FUNCTION)' entry, and means that SYMBOL was an</br>
autoload before this file redefined it as a function.  In addition,</br>
entries may also be single symbols, which means that SYMBOL was</br>
defined by `defvar' or `defconst'.</br>
</br>
During preloading, the file name recorded is relative to the main Lisp</br>
directory.  These file names are converted to absolute at startup.</br>
