<strong>load-prefer-newer</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means `load' prefers the newest version of a file.</br>
This applies when a filename suffix is not explicitly specified and</br>
`load' is trying various possible suffixes (see `load-suffixes' and</br>
`load-file-rep-suffixes').  Normally, it stops at the first file</br>
that exists unless you explicitly specify one or the other.  If this</br>
option is non-nil, it checks all suffixes and uses whichever file is</br>
newest.</br>
Note that if you customize this, obviously it will not affect files</br>
that are loaded before your customizations are read!</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
