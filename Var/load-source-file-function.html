Function called in `load' to load an Emacs Lisp source file.</br>
The value should be a function for doing code conversion before</br>
reading a source file.  It can also be nil, in which case loading is</br>
done without any code conversion.</br>
</br>
If the value is a function, it is called with four arguments,</br>
FULLNAME, FILE, NOERROR, NOMESSAGE.  FULLNAME is the absolute name of</br>
the file to load, FILE is the non-absolute name (for messages etc.),</br>
and NOERROR and NOMESSAGE are the corresponding arguments passed to</br>
`load'.  The function should return t if the file was loaded.
