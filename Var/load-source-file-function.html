<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Function called in `load' to load an Emacs Lisp source file.<br/>
The value should be a function for doing code conversion before<br/>
reading a source file.  It can also be nil, in which case loading is<br/>
done without any code conversion.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is a function, it is called with four arguments,<br/>
FULLNAME, FILE, NOERROR, NOMESSAGE.  FULLNAME is the absolute name of<br/>
the file to load, FILE is the non-absolute name (for messages etc.),<br/>
and NOERROR and NOMESSAGE are the corresponding arguments passed to<br/>
`load'.  The function should return t if the file was loaded.
