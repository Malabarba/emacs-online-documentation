Documentation:<br/>
Like `enable-local-variables' but meant for buffer-local bindings.<br/>
The meaningful values are nil and non-nil.  The default is non-nil.<br/>
If a major mode sets this to nil, buffer-locally, then any local<br/>
variables list in a file visited in that mode will be ignored.<br/>
<br/>
This variable does not affect the use of major modes specified<br/>
in a -*- line.
