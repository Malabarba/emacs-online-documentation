Executable program for searching a database of files.</br>
The Emacs commands `locate' and `locate-with-filter' use this.</br>
The value should be a program that can be called from a shell</br>
with one argument, SEARCH-STRING.  The program determines which</br>
database it searches.  The output of the program should consist</br>
of those file names in the database that match SEARCH-STRING,</br>
listed one per line, possibly with leading or trailing</br>
whitespace.  If the output is in another form, you may have to</br>
redefine the function `locate-get-file-positions'.</br>
</br>
The program may interpret SEARCH-STRING as a literal string, a</br>
shell pattern or a regular expression.  The exact rules of what</br>
constitutes a match may also depend on the program.</br>
</br>
The standard value of this variable is "locate".</br>
This program normally searches a database of all files on your</br>
system, or of all files that you have access to.  Consult the</br>
documentation of that program for the details about how it determines</br>
which file names match SEARCH-STRING.  (Those details vary highly with</br>
the version.)</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
