Regexp of directory names which stop the search in `locate-dominating-file'.</br>
Any directory whose name matches this regexp will be treated like</br>
a kind of root directory by `locate-dominating-file' which will stop its search</br>
when it bumps into it.</br>
The default regexp prevents fruitless and time-consuming attempts to find</br>
special files in directories in which filenames are interpreted as hostnames,</br>
or mount points potentially requiring authentication as a different user.
