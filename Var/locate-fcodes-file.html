locate-fcodes-file is a variable defined in `locate.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>File name for the database of file names used by `locate'.<br/>If non-nil, `locate' uses this name in the header of the `*Locate*'<br/>buffer.  If nil, it mentions no file name in that header.<br/><br/>Just setting this variable does not actually change the database<br/>that `locate' searches.  The executive program that the Emacs<br/>function `locate' uses, as given by the variables `locate-command'<br/>or `locate-make-command-line', determines the database.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
