Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, include full ChangeLog paragraphs in the log.</br>
This may be set in the ``local variables'' section of a ChangeLog, to</br>
indicate the policy for that ChangeLog.</br>
</br>
A ChangeLog paragraph is a bunch of log text containing no blank lines;</br>
a paragraph usually describes a set of changes with a single purpose,</br>
but perhaps spanning several functions in several files.  Changes in</br>
different paragraphs are unrelated.</br>
</br>
You could argue that the log entry for a file should contain the</br>
full ChangeLog paragraph mentioning the change to the file, even though</br>
it may mention other files, because that gives you the full context you</br>
need to understand the change.  This is the behavior you get when this</br>
variable is set to t.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, you could argue that the log entry for a change</br>
should contain only the text for the changes which occurred in that</br>
file, because the log is per-file.  This is the behavior you get</br>
when this variable is set to nil.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
