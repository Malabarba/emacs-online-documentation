longlines-wrap-follows-window-size is a variable defined in `longlines.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means wrapping and filling happen at the edge of the window.<br/>Otherwise, `fill-column' is used, regardless of the window size.  This<br/>does not work well when the buffer is displayed in multiple windows<br/>with differing widths.<br/><br/>If the value is an integer, that specifies the distance from the<br/>right edge of the window at which wrapping occurs.  For any other<br/>non-nil value, wrapping occurs 2 characters from the right edge.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
