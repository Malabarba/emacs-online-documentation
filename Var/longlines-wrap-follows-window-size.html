<strong>longlines-wrap-follows-window-size</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>longlines.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means wrapping and filling happen at the edge of the window.<br/>
Otherwise, `fill-column' is used, regardless of the window size.  This<br/>
does not work well when the buffer is displayed in multiple windows<br/>
with differing widths.<br/>
<br/>
If the value is an integer, that specifies the distance from the<br/>
right edge of the window at which wrapping occurs.  For any other<br/>
non-nil value, wrapping occurs 2 characters from the right edge.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
