<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Name of program for printing a file.</br>
</br>
On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, if the value is an empty string then</br>
Emacs will write directly to the printer port named by `printer-name'.</br>
The programs `print' and `nprint' (the standard print programs on</br>
Windows NT and Novell Netware respectively) are handled specially, using</br>
`printer-name' as the destination for output; any other program is</br>
treated like `lpr' except that an explicit filename is given as the last</br>
argument.</br>

You can customize this variable.
