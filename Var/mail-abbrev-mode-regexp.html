Regexp matching mail headers in which mail abbrevs should be expanded.</br>
This string will be handed to `looking-at' with point at the beginning</br>
of the current line; if it matches, abbrev mode will be turned on, otherwise</br>
it will be turned off.  (You don't need to worry about continuation lines.)</br>
This should be set to match those mail fields in which you want abbreviations</br>
turned on.</br>

You can customize this variable.
