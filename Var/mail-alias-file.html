Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, the name of a file to use instead of the sendmail default.<br/>
This file defines aliases to be expanded by the mailer; this is a different<br/>
feature from that of defining aliases in `.mailrc' to be expanded in Emacs.<br/>
This variable has no effect unless your system uses sendmail as its mailer.<br/>
The default file is defined in sendmail's configuration file, e.g.<br/>
`/etc/aliases'.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
