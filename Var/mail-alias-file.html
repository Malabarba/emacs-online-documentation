</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, the name of a file to use instead of the sendmail default.</br>
This file defines aliases to be expanded by the mailer; this is a different</br>
feature from that of defining aliases in `.mailrc' to be expanded in Emacs.</br>
This variable has no effect unless your system uses sendmail as its mailer.</br>
The default file is defined in sendmail's configuration file, e.g.</br>
`/etc/aliases'.</br>

You can customize this variable.
