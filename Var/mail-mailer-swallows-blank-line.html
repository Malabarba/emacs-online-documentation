Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul><li>  <strong>This variable is obsolete since 24.1;</br>
  no need to set this on any modern system.</strong></li><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>

Set this non-nil if the system's mailer runs the header and body together.</br>
The actual value should be an expression to evaluate that returns</br>
non-nil if the problem will actually occur.</br>
(As far as we know, this is not an issue on any system still supported</br>
by Emacs.)
