Obsolete hook for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail buffer.<br/>
Each hook function can find the citation between (point) and (mark t).<br/>
And each hook function should leave point and mark around the citation<br/>
text as modified.<br/>
This is a normal hook, misnamed for historical reasons.<br/>
It is obsolete and mail agents should no longer use it.
