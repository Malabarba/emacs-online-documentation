<strong>major-mode</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>

Symbol for current buffer's major mode.</br>
The default value (normally `fundamental-mode') affects new buffers.</br>
A value of nil means to use the current buffer's major mode, provided</br>
it is not marked as "special".</br>
</br>
When a mode is used by default, `find-file' switches to it before it</br>
reads the contents into the buffer and before it finishes setting up</br>
the buffer.  Thus, the mode and its hooks should not expect certain</br>
variables such as `buffer-read-only' and `buffer-file-coding-system'</br>
to be set up.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
