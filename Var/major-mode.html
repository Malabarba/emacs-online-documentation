major-mode is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is lisp-interaction-mode<br/>Original value was fundamental-mode<br/>Local in buffer *scratch*; global value is fundamental-mode<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Symbol for current buffer's major mode.<br/>The default value (normally `fundamental-mode') affects new buffers.<br/>A value of nil means to use the current buffer's major mode, provided<br/>it is not marked as "special".<br/><br/>When a mode is used by default, `find-file' switches to it before it<br/>reads the contents into the buffer and before it finishes setting up<br/>the buffer.  Thus, the mode and its hooks should not expect certain<br/>variables such as `buffer-read-only' and `buffer-file-coding-system'<br/>to be set up.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
