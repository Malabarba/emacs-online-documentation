<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A function that `make-backup-file-name' uses to create backup file names.</br>
The function receives a single argument, the original file name.</br>
</br>
If you change this, you may need to change `backup-file-name-p' and</br>
`file-name-sans-versions' too.</br>
</br>
You could make this buffer-local to do something special for specific files.</br>
</br>
For historical reasons, a value of nil means to use the default function.</br>
This should not be relied upon.</br>
</br>
See also `backup-directory-alist'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
