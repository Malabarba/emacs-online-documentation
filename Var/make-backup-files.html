Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means make a backup of a file the first time it is saved.</br>
This can be done by renaming the file or by copying.</br>
</br>
Renaming means that Emacs renames the existing file so that it is a</br>
backup file, then writes the buffer into a new file.  Any other names</br>
that the old file had will now refer to the backup file.  The new file</br>
is owned by you and its group is defaulted.</br>
</br>
Copying means that Emacs copies the existing file into the backup</br>
file, then writes the buffer on top of the existing file.  Any other</br>
names that the old file had will now refer to the new (edited) file.</br>
The file's owner and group are unchanged.</br>
</br>
The choice of renaming or copying is controlled by the variables</br>
`backup-by-copying', `backup-by-copying-when-linked',</br>
`backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' and</br>
`backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch'.  See also `backup-inhibited'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
