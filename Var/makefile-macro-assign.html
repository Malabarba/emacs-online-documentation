Its value is <pre>" = "</pre></br>

String to append to all macro names inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.</br>
The normal value should be " = ", since this is what</br>
standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake</br>
allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you</br>
might prefer to use " += " or " := " .</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
