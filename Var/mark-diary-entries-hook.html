List of functions called after marking diary entries in the calendar.</br>
You might wish to add `diary-mark-included-diary-files', in which case</br>
you will probably also want to add `diary-include-other-diary-files' to</br>
`diary-list-entries-hook'.</br>
</br>
This hook runs after `diary-nongregorian-marking-hook'.  These two hooks</br>
differ only if you are using included diary files.  In that case,</br>
`diary-nongregorian-marking-hook' runs for each file, whereas</br>
`diary-mark-entries-hook' only runs once, for the main diary file.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
