Limit on depth in `eval', `apply' and `funcall' before error.</br>
</br>
This limit serves to catch infinite recursions for you before they cause</br>
actual stack overflow in C, which would be fatal for Emacs.</br>
You can safely make it considerably larger than its default value,</br>
if that proves inconveniently small.  However, if you increase it too far,</br>
Emacs could overflow the real C stack, and crash.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
