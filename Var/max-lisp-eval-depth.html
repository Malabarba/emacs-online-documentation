<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Limit on depth in `eval', `apply' and `funcall' before error.<br/>
<br/>
This limit serves to catch infinite recursions for you before they cause<br/>
actual stack overflow in C, which would be fatal for Emacs.<br/>
You can safely make it considerably larger than its default value,<br/>
if that proves inconveniently small.  However, if you increase it too far,<br/>
Emacs could overflow the real C stack, and crash.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
