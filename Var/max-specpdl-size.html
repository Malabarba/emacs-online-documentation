<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Limit on number of Lisp variable bindings and `unwind-protect's.</br>
If Lisp code tries to increase the total number past this amount,</br>
an error is signaled.</br>
You can safely use a value considerably larger than the default value,</br>
if that proves inconveniently small.  However, if you increase it too far,</br>
Emacs could run out of memory trying to make the stack bigger.</br>
Note that this limit may be silently increased by the debugger</br>
if `debug-on-error' or `debug-on-quit' is set.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
