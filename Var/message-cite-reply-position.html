<strong>message-cite-reply-position</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>message.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is traditional<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Where the reply should be positioned.<br/>
If `traditional', reply inline.<br/>
If `above', reply above quoted text.<br/>
If `below', reply below quoted text.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Many newsgroups frown upon nontraditional reply styles. You<br/>
probably want to set this variable only for specific groups,<br/>
e.g. using `gnus-posting-styles':<br/>
<br/>
  (eval (set (make-local-variable 'message-cite-reply-position) 'above))<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
