Its value is <pre>best</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Non-nil means show forwarded messages as MML (decoded from MIME).</br>
Otherwise, forwarded messages are unchanged.</br>
Can also be the symbol `best' to indicate that MML should be</br>
used, except when it is a bad idea to use MML.  One example where</br>
it is a bad idea is when forwarding a signed or encrypted</br>
message, because converting MIME to MML would invalidate the</br>
digital signature.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
