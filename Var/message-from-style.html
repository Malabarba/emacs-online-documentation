Specifies how "From" headers look.</br>

If nil, they contain just the return address like:</br>
	king@grassland.com</br>
If `parens', they look like:</br>
	king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)</br>
If `angles', they look like:</br>
	Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com></br>
</br>
Otherwise, most addresses look like `angles', but they look like</br>
`parens' if `angles' would need quoting and `parens' would not.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
