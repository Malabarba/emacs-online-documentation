<strong>message-generate-headers-first</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>message.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Which headers should be generated before starting to compose a message.<br/>
If t, generate all required headers.  This can also be a list of headers to<br/>
generate.  The variables `message-required-news-headers' and<br/>
`message-required-mail-headers' specify which headers to generate.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the variable `message-deletable-headers' specifies headers which<br/>
are to be deleted and then re-generated before sending, so this variable<br/>
will not have a visible effect for those headers.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
