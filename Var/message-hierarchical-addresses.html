Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list of hierarchical mail address definitions.</br>
</br>
Inside each entry, the first address is the "top" address, and</br>
subsequent addresses are subaddresses; this is used to indicate that</br>
mail sent to the first address will automatically be delivered to the</br>
subaddresses.  So if the first address appears in the recipient list</br>
for a message, the subaddresses will be removed (if present) before</br>
the mail is sent.  All addresses in this structure should be</br>
downcased.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
