List of `self-insert-command's used to trigger ecomplete.</br>
When one of those commands is invoked to enter a character in To or Cc</br>
header, ecomplete will suggest the candidates of recipients (see also</br>
`message-mail-alias-type').  If you use some tool to enter non-ASCII</br>
text and it replaces `self-insert-command' with the other command, e.g.</br>
`egg-self-insert-command', you may want to add it to this list.</br>

You can customize this variable.
