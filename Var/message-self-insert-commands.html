List of `self-insert-command's used to trigger ecomplete.<br/>
When one of those commands is invoked to enter a character in To or Cc<br/>
header, ecomplete will suggest the candidates of recipients (see also<br/>
`message-mail-alias-type').  If you use some tool to enter non-ASCII<br/>
text and it replaces `self-insert-command' with the other command, e.g.<br/>
`egg-self-insert-command', you may want to add it to this list.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
