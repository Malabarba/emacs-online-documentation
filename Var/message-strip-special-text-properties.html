Strip special properties from the message buffer.</br>
</br>
Emacs has a number of special text properties which can break message</br>
composing in various ways.  If this option is set, message will strip</br>
these properties from the message composition buffer.  However, some</br>
packages requires these properties to be present in order to work.</br>
If you use one of these packages, turn this option off, and hope the</br>
message composition doesn't break too bad.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
