*What to do with trailing "(was: <old subject>)" in subject lines.</br>

the user what do do.  In this case, the subject is matched against</br>
`message-subject-trailing-was-ask-regexp'.  If</br>
`message-subject-trailing-was-query' is t, always strip the trailing</br>
old subject.  In this case, `message-subject-trailing-was-regexp' is</br>
used.</br>
