mh-adaptive-cmd-note-flag is a variable defined in `mh-e.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Non-nil means that the message number width is determined dynamically.<br/><br/>If you've created your own format to handle long message numbers,<br/>you'll be pleased to know you no longer need it since MH-E adapts its<br/>internal format based upon the largest message number if this option<br/>is on (the default). This option may only be turned on when<br/>`mh-scan-format-file' is set to "Use MH-E scan Format".<br/><br/>If you prefer fixed-width message numbers, turn off this option and<br/>call `mh-set-cmd-note' with the width specified by your format file<br/>(see `mh-scan-format-file'). For example, the default width is 4, so<br/>you would use "(mh-set-cmd-note 4)".<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
