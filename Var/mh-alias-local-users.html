<strong>mh-alias-local-users</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Non-nil means local users are added to alias completion.</br>
</br>
Aliases are created from "/etc/passwd" entries with a user ID</br>
larger than a magical number, typically 200. This can be a handy</br>
tool on a machine where you and co-workers exchange messages.</br>
These aliases have the form "local.first.last" if a real name is</br>
present in the password file. Otherwise, the alias will have the</br>
form "local.login".</br>
</br>
If you're on a system with thousands of users you don't know, and</br>
the loading of local aliases slows MH-E down noticeably, then</br>
turn this option off.</br>
</br>
This option also takes a string which is executed to generate the</br>
password file. For example, use "ypcat passwd" to obtain the</br>
NIS password file.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.1 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
