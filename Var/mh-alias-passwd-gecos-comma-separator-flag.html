Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Non-nil means the gecos field in the password file uses a comma separator.<br/>
<br/>
In the example in `mh-alias-local-users-prefix', commas are used<br/>
to separate different values within the so-called gecos field.<br/>
This is a fairly common usage. However, in the rare case that the<br/>
gecos field in your password file is not separated by commas and<br/>
whose contents may contain commas, you can turn this option off.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 7.4 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
