<strong>mh-auto-fields-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of recipients for which header lines are automatically inserted.</br>
</br>
This option can be used to set the identity depending on the</br>
recipient. To customize this option, click on the "INS" button and</br>
enter a regular expression for the recipient's address. Click on the</br>
"INS" button with the "Add at least one item below" label. Then choose</br>
one of the items in the "Value Menu".</br>
</br>
The "Identity" menu item is used to select an identity from those</br>
configured in `mh-identity-list'. All of the information for that</br>
identity will be added if the recipient matches. The "Fcc Field" menu</br>
item is used to select a folder that is used in the "Fcc:" header.</br>
When you send the message, MH will put a copy of your message in this</br>
folder. The "Mail-Followup-To Field" menu item is used to insert an</br>
"Mail-Followup-To:" header field with the recipients you provide. If</br>
the recipient's mail user agent supports this header field (as nmh</br>
does), then their replies will go to the addresses listed. This is</br>
useful if their replies go both to the list and to you and you don't</br>
have a mechanism to suppress duplicates. If you reply to someone not</br>
on the list, you must either remove the "Mail-Followup-To:" field, or</br>
ensure the recipient is also listed there so that he receives replies</br>
to your reply. Other header fields may be added using the "Other</br>
Field" menu item.</br>
</br>
These fields can only be added after the recipient is known. Once the</br>
header contains one or more recipients, run the</br>
M-x mh-insert-auto-fields command or choose the "Identity -> Insert</br>
Auto Fields" menu item to insert these fields manually. However, you</br>
can just send the message and the fields will be added automatically.</br>
You are given a chance to see these fields and to confirm them before</br>
the message is actually sent. You can do away with this confirmation</br>
by turning off the option `mh-auto-fields-prompt-flag'.</br>
</br>
You should avoid using the same header field in `mh-auto-fields-list'</br>
and `mh-identity-list' definitions that may apply to the same message</br>
as the result is undefined.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.3 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
