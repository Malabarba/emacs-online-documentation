*Non-nil means show buffer is buried.</br>
</br>
One advantage of not burying the show buffer is that one can</br>
delete the show buffer more easily in an electric buffer list</br>
because of its proximity to its associated MH-Folder buffer. Try</br>
running M-x electric-buffer-list to see what I mean.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
