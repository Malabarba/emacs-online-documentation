*Non-nil means that messages are forwarded as attachments.</br>
</br>
By default, this option is on which means that the forwarded</br>
messages are included as attachments. If you would prefer to</br>
forward your messages verbatim (as text, inline), then turn off</br>
this option. Forwarding messages verbatim works well for short,</br>
textual messages, but your recipient won't be able to view any</br>
non-textual attachments that were in the forwarded message. Be</br>
aware that if you have "forw: -mime" in your MH profile, then</br>
forwarded messages will always be included as attachments</br>
regardless of the settings of this option.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
