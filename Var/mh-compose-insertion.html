Type of tags used when composing MIME messages.</br>
</br>
In addition to MH-style directives, MH-E also supports MML (MIME</br>
Meta Language) tags. (see Info node `(emacs-mime)Composing').</br>
This option can be used to choose between them. By default, this</br>
option is set to "MML" if it is supported since it provides a</br>
lot more functionality. This option can also be set to "MH" if</br>
MH-style directives are preferred.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
