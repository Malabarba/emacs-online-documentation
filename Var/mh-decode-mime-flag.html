Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Non-nil means attachments are handled.</br>
</br>
MH-E can handle attachments as well if the Gnus `mm-decode'</br>
library is present. If so, this option will be on. Otherwise,</br>
you'll see the MIME body parts rather than text or attachments.</br>
There isn't much point in turning off this option; however, you</br>
can inspect it if it appears that the body parts are not being</br>
interpreted correctly or toggle it with the command</br>
; to view the raw message.</br>
</br>
This option also controls the display of quoted-printable</br>
messages and other graphical widgets. See the options</br>
`mh-graphical-smileys-flag' and `mh-graphical-emphasis-flag'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
