*List of addresses and folders.</br>

The folder name associated with the first address found in this</br>
list is used as the default for `mh-refile-msg' and similar</br>
functions. Each element in this list contains a "Check Recipient"</br>
item. If this item is turned on, then the address is checked</br>
against the recipient instead of the sender. This is useful for</br>
mailing lists.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
