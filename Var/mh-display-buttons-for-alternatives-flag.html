*Non-nil means display buttons for all alternative attachments.</br>
</br>
Sometimes, a mail program will produce multiple alternatives of</br>
the attachment in increasing degree of faithfulness to the</br>
original content. By default, only the preferred alternative is</br>
displayed. If this option is on, then the preferred part is shown</br>
inline and buttons are shown for each of the other alternatives.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.4 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
