<strong>mh-display-buttons-for-inline-parts-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Non-nil means display buttons for all inline attachments.<br/>
<br/>
The sender can request that attachments should be viewed inline so<br/>
that they do not really appear like an attachment at all to the<br/>
reader. Most of the time, this is desirable, so by default MH-E<br/>
suppresses the buttons for inline attachments. On the other hand, you<br/>
may receive code or HTML which the sender has added to his message as<br/>
inline attachments so that you can read them in MH-E. In this case, it<br/>
is useful to see the buttons so that you know you don't have to cut<br/>
and paste the code into a file; you can simply save the attachment.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make the buttons visible for inline attachments, you<br/>
can use the command K t to toggle the<br/>
visibility of these buttons. You can turn on these buttons permanently<br/>
by turning on this option.<br/>
<br/>
MH-E cannot display all attachments inline however. It can display<br/>
text (including HTML) and images.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
