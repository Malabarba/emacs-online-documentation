*Control fetching of "X-Image-URL:" header field image.</br>
</br>
Ths option controls the fetching of the "X-Image-URL:" header</br>
field image with the following values:</br>
</br>
Ask Before Fetching</br>
     You are prompted before the image is fetched. MH-E will</br>
     remember your reply and will either use the already fetched</br>
     image the next time the same URL is encountered or silently</br>
     skip it if you didn't fetch it the first time. This is a</br>
     good setting.</br>
</br>
Never Fetch</br>
     Images are never fetched and only displayed if they are</br>
     already present in the cache. This is the default.</br>
</br>
There isn't a value of "Always Fetch" for privacy and DOS (denial of</br>
service) reasons. For example, fetching a URL can tip off a spammer</br>
that you've read his email (which is why you shouldn't blindly answer</br>
yes if you've set this option to "Ask Before Fetching"). Someone may</br>
also flood your network and fill your disk drive by sending a torrent</br>
of messages, each specifying a unique URL to a very large file.</br>
</br>
The cache of images is found in the directory ".mhe-x-image-cache"</br>
within your MH directory. You can add your own face to the "From:"</br>
field too. See Info node `(mh-e)Picture'.</br>
</br>
This setting only has effect if the option `mh-show-use-xface-flag' is</br>
turned on.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.3 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
