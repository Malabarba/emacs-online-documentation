*Non-nil means graphical emphasis is displayed.</br>
</br>
A few typesetting features are indicated in ASCII text with</br>
certain characters. If your terminal supports it, MH-E can render</br>
these typesetting directives naturally if this option is turned</br>
on, which it is by default. For example, _underline_ will be</br>
underlined, *bold* will appear in bold, /italics/ will appear in</br>
italics, and so on. See the option `gnus-emphasis-alist' for the</br>
whole list.</br>
</br>
This option is disabled if the option `mh-decode-mime-flag' is</br>
turned off.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
