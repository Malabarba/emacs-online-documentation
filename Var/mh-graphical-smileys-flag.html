It is a long standing custom to inject body language using a</br>
cornucopia of punctuation, also known as the "smileys". MH-E</br>
can render these as graphical widgets if this option is turned</br>
on, which it is by default. Smileys include patterns such as :-)</br>
and ;-).</br>
</br>
This option is disabled if the option `mh-decode-mime-flag' is</br>
turned off.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
