Style for highlighting citations.</br>
</br>
If the sender of the message has cited other messages in his</br>
message, then MH-E will highlight these citations to emphasize</br>
the sender's actual response. This option can be customized to</br>
change the highlighting style. The "Multicolor" method uses a</br>
different color for each indentation while the "Monochrome"</br>
method highlights all citations in red. To disable highlighting</br>
of citations entirely, choose "None".</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
