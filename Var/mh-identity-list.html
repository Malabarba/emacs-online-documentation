Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*List of identities.</br>
</br>
To customize this option, click on the "INS" button and enter a label</br>
such as "Home" or "Work". Then click on the "INS" button with the</br>
label "Add at least one item below". Then choose one of the items in</br>
the "Value Menu".</br>
</br>
You can specify an alternate "From:" header field using the "From</br>
Field" menu item. You must include a valid email address. A standard</br>
format is "First Last <login@@host.domain>". If you use an initial</br>
with a period, then you must quote your name as in '"First I. Last"</br>
<login@@host.domain>'. People usually list the name of the company</br>
where they work using the "Organization Field" menu item. Set any</br>
arbitrary header field and value in the "Other Field" menu item.</br>
Unless the header field is a standard one, precede the name of your</br>
field's label with "X-", as in "X-Fruit-of-the-Day:". The value of</br>
"Attribution Verb" overrides the setting of</br>
`mh-extract-from-attribution-verb'. Set your signature with the</br>
"Signature" menu item. You can specify the contents of</br>
`mh-signature-file-name', a file, or a function. Specify a different</br>
key to sign or encrypt messages with the "GPG Key ID" menu item.</br>
</br>
You can select the identities you have added via the menu called</br>
"Identity" in the MH-Letter buffer. You can also use</br>
M-x mh-insert-identity. To clear the fields and signature added by the</br>
identity, select the "None" identity.</br>
</br>
The "Identity" menu contains two other items to save you from having</br>
to set the identity on every message. The menu item "Set Default for</br>
Session" can be used to set the default identity to the current</br>
identity until you exit Emacs. The menu item "Save as Default" sets</br>
the option `mh-identity-default' to the current identity setting. You</br>
can also customize the `mh-identity-default' option in the usual</br>
fashion.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.1 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
