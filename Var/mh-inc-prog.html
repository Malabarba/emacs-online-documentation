This program generates a one-line summary for each of the new</br>
messages. Unless it is an absolute pathname, the file is assumed</br>
to be in the `mh-progs' directory. You may also link a file to</br>
"inc" that uses a different format. You'll then need to modify</br>
several scan line format variables appropriately.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
