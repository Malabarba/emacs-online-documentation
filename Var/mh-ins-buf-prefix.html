Its value is <pre>"> "</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*String to put before each line of a yanked or inserted message.</br>
</br>
The prefix "> " is the default setting of this option. I</br>
suggest that you not modify this option since it is used by many</br>
mailers and news readers: messages are far easier to read if</br>
several included messages have all been indented by the same</br>
string.</br>
</br>
This prefix is not inserted if you use one of the supercite</br>
flavors of `mh-yank-behavior' or you have added a</br>
`mail-citation-hook'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
