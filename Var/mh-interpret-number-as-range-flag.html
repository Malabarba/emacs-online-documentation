*Non-nil means interpret a number as a range.</br>
</br>
Since one of the most frequent ranges used is "last:N", MH-E</br>
will interpret input such as "200" as "last:200" if this</br>
option is on (which is the default). If you need to scan just the</br>
message 200, then use the range "200:200".</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.4 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
