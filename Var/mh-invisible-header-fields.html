*Additional header fields to hide.</br>
</br>
Header fields that you would like to hide that aren't listed in</br>
`mh-invisible-header-fields-default' can be added to this option</br>
with a couple of caveats. Regular expressions are not allowed.</br>
Unique fields should have a ":" suffix; otherwise, the element</br>
can be used to render invisible an entire class of fields that</br>
start with the same prefix.</br>
</br>
If you think a header field should be generally ignored, please</br>
update SF #1916032 (see URL</br>
`https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1916032&group_id=13357&atid=113357').</br>
</br>
See also `mh-clean-message-header-flag'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.1 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
