Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If on, spam programs are run in background.</br>
</br>
By default, the programs are run in the foreground, but this can</br>
be slow when junking large numbers of messages. If you have</br>
enough memory or don't junk that many messages at the same time,</br>
you might try turning on this option.</br>
</br>
Note that this option is used as the "display" argument in the</br>
call to `call-process'. Therefore, turning on this option means</br>
setting its value to "0". You can also set its value to t to</br>
direct the programs' output to the "*MH-E Log*" buffer; this</br>
may be useful for debugging.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
