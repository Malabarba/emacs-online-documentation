mh-junk-background is a variable defined in `mh-e.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If on, spam programs are run in background.<br/><br/>By default, the programs are run in the foreground, but this can<br/>be slow when junking large numbers of messages. If you have<br/>enough memory or don't junk that many messages at the same time,<br/>you might try turning on this option.<br/><br/>Note that this option is used as the "display" argument in the<br/>call to `call-process'. Therefore, turning on this option means<br/>setting its value to "0". You can also set its value to t to<br/>direct the programs' output to the "*MH-E Log*" buffer; this<br/>may be useful for debugging.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
