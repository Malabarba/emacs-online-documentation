Spam program that MH-E should use.</br>
</br>
The default setting of this option is "Auto-detect" which means</br>
that MH-E will automatically choose one of SpamAssassin,</br>
bogofilter, or SpamProbe in that order. If, for example, you have</br>
both SpamAssassin and bogofilter installed and you want to use</br>
bogofilter, then you can set this option to "Bogofilter".</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.3 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
