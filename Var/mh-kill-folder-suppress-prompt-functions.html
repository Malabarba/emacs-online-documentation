Abnormal hook run at the beginning of F k.</br>
</br>
The hook functions are called with no arguments and should return</br>
a non-nil value to suppress the normal prompt when you remove a</br>
folder. This is useful for folders that are easily regenerated.</br>
</br>
The default value of `mh-search-p' suppresses the prompt on</br>
folders generated by searching.</br>
</br>
WARNING: Use this hook with care. If there is a bug in your hook</br>
which returns t on "+inbox" and you hit F k by</br>
accident in the "+inbox" folder, you will not be happy.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.4 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
