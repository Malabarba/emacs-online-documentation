Abnormal hook run at the beginning of F k.<br/>
<br/>
The hook functions are called with no arguments and should return<br/>
a non-nil value to suppress the normal prompt when you remove a<br/>
folder. This is useful for folders that are easily regenerated.<br/>
<br/>
The default value of `mh-search-p' suppresses the prompt on<br/>
folders generated by searching.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: Use this hook with care. If there is a bug in your hook<br/>
which returns t on "+inbox" and you hit F k by<br/>
accident in the "+inbox" folder, you will not be happy.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
