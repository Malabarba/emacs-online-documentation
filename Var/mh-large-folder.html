</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The number of messages that indicates a large folder.</br>
</br>
If a folder is deemed to be large, that is the number of messages</br>
in it exceed this value, then confirmation is needed when it is</br>
visited. Even when `mh-show-threads-flag' is non-nil, the folder</br>
is not automatically threaded, if it is large. If set to nil all</br>
folders are treated as if they are small.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
