Hook run by `mh-letter-mode' on a new letter.<br/>
<br/>
This hook allows you to do some processing before editing a<br/>
letter. For example, you may wish to modify the header after<br/>
"repl" has done its work, or you may have a complicated<br/>
"components" file and need to tell MH-E where the cursor should<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
