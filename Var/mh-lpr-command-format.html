*Command used to print.</br>
</br>
This option contains the Unix command line which performs the</br>
actual printing for the P l command. The string can</br>
contain one escape, "%s", which is replaced by the name of the</br>
folder and the message number and is useful for print job names.</br>
I use "mpage -h'%s' -b Letter -H1of -mlrtb -P" which produces a</br>
nice header and adds a bit of margin so the text fits within my</br>
printer's margins.</br>
</br>
This options is not used by the commands P p or</br>
P f.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
