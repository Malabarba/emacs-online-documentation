This variable should not be used directly in programs. Programs<br/>
should use `mail-header-separator' instead.<br/>
`mail-header-separator' is initialized to<br/>
`mh-mail-header-separator' in `mh-letter-mode'; in other<br/>
contexts, you may have to perform this initialization yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Do not make this a regular expression as it may be the argument<br/>
to `insert' and it is passed through `regexp-quote' before being<br/>
used by functions like `re-search-forward'.
