mh-mhl-format-file is a variable defined in `mh-e.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Specifies the format file to pass to the "mhl" program.<br/><br/>Normally MH-E takes care of displaying messages itself (rather than<br/>calling an MH program to do the work). If you'd rather have "mhl"<br/>display the message (within MH-E), change this option from its default<br/>value of "Use Default mhl Format (Printing Only)".<br/><br/>You can set this option to "Use Default mhl Format" to get the same<br/>output as you would get if you ran "mhl" from the shell.<br/><br/>If you have a format file that you want MH-E to use, you can set this<br/>option to "Specify an mhl Format File" and enter the name of your<br/>format file. Your format file should specify a non-zero value for<br/>"overflowoffset" to allow MH-E to parse the header. Note that<br/>"mhl" is always used for printing and forwarding; in this case, the<br/>value of this option is consulted if you have specified a format<br/>file.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
