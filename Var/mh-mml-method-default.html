Its value is <pre>"pgpmime"</pre></br>

Default method to use in security tags.</br>
</br>
This option is used to select between a variety of mail security</br>
mechanisms. The default is "PGP (MIME)" if it is supported;</br>
otherwise, the default is "None". Other mechanisms include</br>
vanilla "PGP" and "S/MIME".</br>
</br>
The `pgg' customization group may have some settings which may</br>
interest you (see Info node `(pgg)').</br>
</br>
In particular, I turn on the option `pgg-encrypt-for-me' so that</br>
all messages I encrypt are encrypted with my public key as well.</br>
If you keep a copy of all of your outgoing mail with a "Fcc:"</br>
header field, this setting is vital so that you can read the mail</br>
you write!</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
