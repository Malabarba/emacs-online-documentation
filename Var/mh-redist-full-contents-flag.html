<strong>mh-redist-full-contents-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Non-nil means the "dist" command needs entire letter for redistribution.<br/>
<br/>
This option must be turned on if "dist" requires the whole<br/>
letter for redistribution, which is the case if "send" is<br/>
compiled with the BERK option (which many people abhor). If you<br/>
find that MH will not allow you to redistribute a message that<br/>
has been redistributed before, turn off this option.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
