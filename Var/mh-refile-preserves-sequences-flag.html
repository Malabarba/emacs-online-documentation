*Non-nil means that sequences are preserved when messages are refiled.</br>
</br>
If a message is in any sequence (except "Previous-Sequence:"</br>
and "cur") when it is refiled, then it will still be in those</br>
sequences in the destination folder. If this behavior is not</br>
desired, then turn off this option.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.4 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
