<strong>mh-scan-blacklisted-msg-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-scan.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"^\\( *[0-9]+\\)B"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
This regular expression matches blacklisted (spam) messages.</br>
</br>
It must match from the beginning of the line. Note that the</br>
default setting of `mh-folder-font-lock-keywords' expects this</br>
expression to contain at least one parenthesized expression which</br>
matches the message number as in the default of</br>
</br>
  "^\\( *[0-9]+\\)B".</br>
</br>
This expression includes the leading space within parenthesis</br>
since it looks better to highlight it as well. The highlighting</br>
is done with the face `mh-folder-blacklisted'. This regular</br>
expression should be correct as it is needed by non-fontification</br>
functions. See also `mh-note-blacklisted'.
