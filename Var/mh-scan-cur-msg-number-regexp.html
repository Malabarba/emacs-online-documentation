mh-scan-cur-msg-number-regexp is a variable defined in `mh-scan.el'.<br/>Its value is "^\\( *[0-9]+\\+\\).*"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>This regular expression matches the current message.<br/><br/>It must match from the beginning of the line.  Note that the<br/>default setting of `mh-folder-font-lock-keywords' expects this<br/>expression to contain at least one parenthesized expression which<br/>matches the message number as in the default of<br/><br/>  "^\\( *[0-9]+\\+\\).*".<br/><br/>This expression includes the leading space and current message<br/>marker "+" within the parenthesis since it looks better to<br/>highlight these items as well.  The highlighting is done with the<br/>face `mh-folder-cur-msg-number'.  This regular expression should<br/>be correct as it is needed by non-fontification functions.  See<br/>also `mh-note-cur'.
