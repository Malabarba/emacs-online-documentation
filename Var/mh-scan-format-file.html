<strong>mh-scan-format-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Specifies the format file to pass to the scan program.</br>
</br>
The default setting for this option is "Use MH-E scan Format". This</br>
means that the format string will be taken from the either</br>
`mh-scan-format-mh' or `mh-scan-format-nmh' depending on whether MH or</br>
nmh (or GNU mailutils MH) is in use. This setting also enables you to</br>
turn on the `mh-adaptive-cmd-note-flag' option.</br>
</br>
You can also set this option to "Use Default scan Format" to get the</br>
same output as you would get if you ran "scan" from the shell. If</br>
you have a format file that you want MH-E to use but not MH, you can</br>
set this option to "Specify a scan Format File" and enter the name</br>
of your format file.</br>
</br>
If you change the format of the scan lines you'll need to tell MH-E</br>
how to parse the new format. As you will see, quite a lot of variables</br>
are involved to do that. Use "M-x apropos RET mh-scan.*regexp" to</br>
obtain a list of these variables. You will also have to call</br>
`mh-set-cmd-note' if your notations are not in column 4 (columns in</br>
Emacs start with 0).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
