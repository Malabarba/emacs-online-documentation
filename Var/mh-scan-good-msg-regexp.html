This regular expression matches "good" messages.</br>
</br>
It must match from the beginning of the line.  Note that the</br>
default setting of `mh-folder-font-lock-keywords' expects this</br>
expression to contain at least one parenthesized expression which</br>
matches the message number as in the default of</br>
</br>
  "^\\( *[0-9]+\\)[^^DBW0-9]".</br>
</br>
This expression includes the leading space within the parenthesis</br>
since it looks better to highlight it as well.  The highlighting</br>
is done with the face `mh-folder-msg-number'.  This regular</br>
expression should be correct as it is needed by non-fontification</br>
functions.
