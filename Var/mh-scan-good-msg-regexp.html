mh-scan-good-msg-regexp is a variable defined in `mh-scan.el'.<br/>Its value is "^\\( *[0-9]+\\)[^D^0-9]"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>This regular expression matches "good" messages.<br/><br/>It must match from the beginning of the line.  Note that the<br/>default setting of `mh-folder-font-lock-keywords' expects this<br/>expression to contain at least one parenthesized expression which<br/>matches the message number as in the default of<br/><br/>  "^\\( *[0-9]+\\)[^D^0-9]".<br/><br/>This expression includes the leading space within the parenthesis<br/>since it looks better to highlight it as well.  The highlighting<br/>is done with the face `mh-folder-msg-number'.  This regular<br/>expression should be correct as it is needed by non-fontification<br/>functions.
