*Program used to scan messages.</br>
</br>
The name of the program that generates a listing of one line per</br>
message is held in this option. Unless this variable contains an</br>
absolute pathname, it is assumed to be in the `mh-progs'</br>
directory. You may link another program to `scan' (see</br>
"mh-profile(5)") to produce a different type of listing.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
