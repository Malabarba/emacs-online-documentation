<strong>mh-scan-rcpt-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-scan.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "\\(To:\\)\\(..............\\)"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
This regular expression specifies the recipient in messages you sent.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the default setting of `mh-folder-font-lock-keywords'<br/>
expects this expression to contain two parenthesized expressions.<br/>
The first is expected to match the "To:" that the default scan<br/>
format file generates.  The second is expected to match the<br/>
recipient's name as in the default of<br/>
"\\(To:\\)\\(..............\\)".  If this regular<br/>
expression is not correct, the "To:" string will not be<br/>
highlighted with the face `mh-folder-to' and the recipient will<br/>
not be highlighted with the face `mh-folder-address'
