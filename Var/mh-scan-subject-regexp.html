<strong>mh-scan-subject-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-scan.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre></br>
"^ *[0-9]+........[ ]*...................\\([Rr][Ee]\\(\\[[0-9]+\\]\\)?:\\s-*\\)*\\([^<\n]*\\)"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
This regular expression matches the subject.</br>
</br>
It must match from the beginning of the line.  Note that the</br>
default setting of `mh-folder-font-lock-keywords' expects this</br>
expression to contain at least three parenthesized expressions.</br>
The first is expected to match the "Re:" string, if any, and is</br>
highlighted with the face `mh-folder-followup'.  The second</br>
matches an optional bracketed number after "Re:", such as in</br>
"Re[2]:" (and is thus a sub-expression of the first expression)</br>
and the third is expected to match the subject line itself which</br>
is highlighted with the face `mh-folder-subject'.  For example,</br>
the default (broken on multiple lines for readability) is</br>
</br>
  ^ *[0-9]+........[ ]*...................</br>
  \\([Rr][Ee]\\(\\[[0-9]+\\]\\)?:\\s-*\\)*</br>
  \\([^<\n]*\\)</br>
</br>
This regular expression should be correct as it is needed by</br>
non-fontification functions.
