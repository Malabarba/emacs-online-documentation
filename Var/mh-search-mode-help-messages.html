This is an associative array which is used to show the most common<br/>
commands. The key is a prefix char. The value is one or more strings<br/>
which are concatenated together and displayed in the minibuffer if ?<br/>
is pressed after the prefix character. The special key nil is used to<br/>
display the non-prefixed commands.<br/>
<br/>
The substitutions described in `substitute-command-keys' are performed<br/>
as well.
