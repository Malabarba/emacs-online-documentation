<strong>mh-send-uses-spost-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-comp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means "send" uses "spost" to submit messages.<br/>
<br/>
If the value of "postproc:" is "spost", you may need to set<br/>
this variable to t to tell MH-E to avoid using features of<br/>
"post" that are not supported by "spost". You'll know that<br/>
you'll need to do this if sending mail fails with an error of<br/>
"spost: -msgid unknown".
