<strong>mh-show-threads-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Non-nil means new folders start in threaded mode.<br/>
<br/>
Threading large number of messages can be time consuming so this<br/>
option is turned off by default. If you turn this option on, then<br/>
threading will be done only if the number of messages being<br/>
threaded is less than `mh-large-folder'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 7.1 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
