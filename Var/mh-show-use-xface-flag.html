<strong>mh-show-use-xface-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Non-nil means display face images in MH-show buffers.</br>
</br>
MH-E can display the content of "Face:", "X-Face:", and</br>
"X-Image-URL:" header fields. If any of these fields occur in the</br>
header of your message, the sender's face will appear in the "From:"</br>
header field. If more than one of these fields appear, then the first</br>
field found in the order "Face:", "X-Face:", and "X-Image-URL:"</br>
will be used.</br>
</br>
The option `mh-show-use-xface-flag' is used to turn this feature on</br>
and off. This feature will be turned on by default if your system</br>
supports it.</br>
</br>
The first header field used, if present, is the Gnus-specific</br>
"Face:" field. The "Face:" field appeared in GNU Emacs 21 and</br>
XEmacs. For more information, see URL</br>
`http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/face/'. Next is the traditional</br>
"X-Face:" header field. The display of this field requires the</br>
"uncompface" program (see URL</br>
`ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/faces/compface/compface.tar.z'). Recent</br>
versions of XEmacs have internal support for "X-Face:" images. If</br>
your version of XEmacs does not, then you'll need both "uncompface"</br>
and the x-face package (see URL `ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/').</br>
</br>
Finally, MH-E will display images referenced by the "X-Image-URL:"</br>
header field if neither the "Face:" nor the "X-Face:" fields are</br>
present. The display of the images requires "wget" (see URL</br>
`http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html'), "fetch", or "curl"</br>
to fetch the image and the "convert" program from the ImageMagick</br>
suite (see URL `http://www.imagemagick.org/'). Of the three header</br>
fields this is the most efficient in terms of network usage since the</br>
image doesn't need to be transmitted with every single mail.</br>
</br>
The option `mh-fetch-x-image-url' controls the fetching of the</br>
"X-Image-URL:" header field image.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
