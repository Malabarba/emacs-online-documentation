mh-signature-file-name is a variable defined in `mh-e.el'.<br/>Its value is "~/.signature"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>*Source of user's signature.<br/><br/>By default, the text of your signature is taken from the file<br/>"~/.signature". You can read from other sources by changing this<br/>option. This file may contain a vCard in which case an attachment is<br/>added with the vCard.<br/><br/>This option may also be a symbol, in which case that function is<br/>called. You may not want a signature separator to be added for you;<br/>instead you may want to insert one yourself. Options that you may find<br/>useful to do this include `mh-signature-separator' (when inserting a<br/>signature separator) and `mh-signature-separator-regexp' (for finding<br/>said separator). The function `mh-signature-separator-p', which<br/>reports t if the buffer contains a separator, may be useful as well.<br/><br/>The signature is inserted into your message with the command<br/>C-c C-s or with the option<br/>`mh-identity-list'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
