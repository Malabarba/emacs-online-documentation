Its value is <pre>"~/.signature"</pre></br>

*Source of user's signature.</br>
</br>
By default, the text of your signature is taken from the file</br>
"~/.signature". You can read from other sources by changing this</br>
option. This file may contain a vCard in which case an attachment is</br>
added with the vCard.</br>
</br>
This option may also be a symbol, in which case that function is</br>
called. You may not want a signature separator to be added for you;</br>
instead you may want to insert one yourself. Options that you may find</br>
useful to do this include `mh-signature-separator' (when inserting a</br>
signature separator) and `mh-signature-separator-regexp' (for finding</br>
said separator). The function `mh-signature-separator-p', which</br>
reports t if the buffer contains a separator, may be useful as well.</br>
</br>
The signature is inserted into your message with the command</br>
C-c C-s or with the option</br>
`mh-identity-list'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 6.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
