*Non-nil means a signature separator should be inserted.</br>
</br>
It is not recommended that you change this option since various</br>
mail user agents, including MH-E, use the separator to present</br>
the signature differently, and to suppress the signature when</br>
replying or yanking a letter into a draft.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
