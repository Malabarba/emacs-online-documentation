*Non-nil means flush MH sequences to disk after message is shown.</br>
</br>
Three sequences are maintained internally by MH-E and pushed out</br>
to MH when a message is shown. They include the sequence</br>
specified by your "Unseen-Sequence:" profile entry, "cur",</br>
and the sequence listed by the option `mh-tick-seq' which is</br>
"tick" by default. If you do not like this behavior, turn off</br>
this option. You can then update the state manually with the</br>
x, q, or M-x mh-update-sequences</br>
commands.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
