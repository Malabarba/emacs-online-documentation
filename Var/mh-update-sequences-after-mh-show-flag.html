*Non-nil means flush MH sequences to disk after message is shown.<br/>
<br/>
Three sequences are maintained internally by MH-E and pushed out<br/>
to MH when a message is shown. They include the sequence<br/>
specified by your "Unseen-Sequence:" profile entry, "cur",<br/>
and the sequence listed by the option `mh-tick-seq' which is<br/>
"tick" by default. If you do not like this behavior, turn off<br/>
this option. You can then update the state manually with the<br/>
x, q, or M-x mh-update-sequences<br/>
commands.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
