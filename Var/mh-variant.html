<strong>mh-variant</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>autodetect</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*Specifies the variant used by MH-E.</br>
</br>
The default setting of this option is "Auto-detect" which means</br>
that MH-E will automatically choose the first of nmh, MH, or GNU</br>
mailutils MH that it finds in the directories listed in</br>
`mh-path' (which you can customize), `mh-sys-path', and</br>
`exec-path'. If MH-E can't find MH at all, you may have to</br>
customize `mh-path' and add the directory in which the command</br>
"mhparam" is located. If, on the other hand, you have both nmh</br>
and GNU mailutils MH installed (for example) and</br>
`mh-variant-in-use' was initialized to nmh but you want to use</br>
GNU mailutils MH, then you can set this option to "gnu-mh".</br>
</br>
When this variable is changed, MH-E resets `mh-progs', `mh-lib',</br>
`mh-lib-progs', `mh-flists-present-flag', and `mh-variant-in-use'</br>
accordingly. Prior to version 8, it was often necessary to set</br>
some of these variables in "~/.emacs"; now it is no longer</br>
necessary and can actually cause problems.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
