*Non-nil means that sequences are preserved when messages are whitelisted.</br>
</br>
If a message is in any sequence (except "Previous-Sequence:"</br>
and "cur") when it is whitelisted, then it will still be in</br>
those sequences in the destination folder. If this behavior is</br>
not desired, then turn off this option.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 8.4 of the MH-E package.
