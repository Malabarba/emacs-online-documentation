<strong>mh-x-face-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mh-e.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"~/.face"</pre></br>

*File containing face header field to insert in outgoing mail.</br>
</br>
If the file starts with either of the strings "X-Face:", "Face:"</br>
or "X-Image-URL:" then the contents are added to the message header</br>
verbatim. Otherwise it is assumed that the file contains the value of</br>
the "X-Face:" header field.</br>
</br>
The "X-Face:" header field, which is a low-resolution, black and</br>
white image, can be generated using the "compface" command (see URL</br>
`ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/faces/compface/compface.tar.Z'). The</br>
"Online X-Face Converter" is a useful resource for quick conversion</br>
of images into "X-Face:" header fields (see URL</br>
`http://www.dairiki.org/xface/').</br>
</br>
Use the "make-face" script to convert a JPEG image to the higher</br>
resolution, color, "Face:" header field (see URL</br>
`http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/face/make-face').</br>
</br>
The URL of any image can be used for the "X-Image-URL:" field and no</br>
processing of the image is required.</br>
</br>
To prevent the setting of any of these header fields, either set</br>
`mh-x-face-file' to nil, or simply ensure that the file defined by</br>
this option doesn't exist.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 7.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.
