Its value is attribution<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Controls which part of a message is yanked by C-c C-y.<br/>
<br/>
To include the entire message, including the entire header, use<br/>
"Body and Header". Use "Body" to yank just the body without<br/>
the header. To yank only the portion of the message following the<br/>
point, set this option to "Below Point".<br/>
<br/>
Choose "Invoke supercite" to pass the entire message and header<br/>
through supercite.<br/>
<br/>
If the "Body With Attribution" setting is used, then the<br/>
message minus the header is yanked and a simple attribution line<br/>
is added at the top using the value of the option<br/>
`mh-extract-from-attribution-verb'. This is the default.<br/>
<br/>
If the "Invoke supercite" or "Body With Attribution" settings<br/>
are used, the "-noformat" argument is passed to the "repl"<br/>
program to override a "-filter" or "-format" argument. These<br/>
settings also have "Automatically" variants that perform the<br/>
action automatically when you reply so that you don't need to use<br/>
C-c C-y at all. Note that this automatic action is<br/>
only performed if the show buffer matches the message being<br/>
replied to. People who use the automatic variants tend to turn on<br/>
the option `mh-delete-yanked-msg-window-flag' as well so that the<br/>
show window is never displayed.<br/>
<br/>
If the show buffer has a region, the option `mh-yank-behavior' is<br/>
ignored unless its value is one of Attribution variants in which<br/>
case the attribution is added to the yanked region.<br/>
<br/>
If this option is set to one of the supercite flavors, the hook<br/>
`mail-citation-hook' is ignored and `mh-ins-buf-prefix' is not<br/>
inserted.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 8.0 of the MH-E package that is part of Emacs 22.1.<br/>
