Obsolete hook for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail buffer.<br/>

And each hook function should leave point and mark around the<br/>
citation text as modified.<br/>

This is a normal hook, misnamed for historical reasons.<br/>
It is obsolete and is only used if `mail-citation-hook' is nil.
