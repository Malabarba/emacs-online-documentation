<strong>minibuffer-allow-text-properties</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means `read-from-minibuffer' should not discard text properties.</br>
This also affects `read-string', but it does not affect `read-minibuffer',</br>
`read-no-blanks-input', or any of the functions that do minibuffer input</br>
with completion; they always discard text properties.
