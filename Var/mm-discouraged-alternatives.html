List of MIME types that are discouraged when viewing multipart/alternative.</br>
Viewing agents are supposed to view the last possible part of a message,</br>
as that is supposed to be the richest.  However, users may prefer other</br>
types instead, and this list says what types are most unwanted.  If,</br>
for instance, text/html parts are very unwanted, and text/richtext are</br>
somewhat unwanted, then the value of this variable should be set</br>
to:</br>
</br>
 ("text/html" "text/richtext")</br>
</br>
Adding "image/.*" might also be useful.  Spammers use it as the</br>
preferred part of multipart/alternative messages.  See also</br>
`gnus-buttonized-mime-types', to which adding "multipart/alternative"</br>
enables you to choose manually one of two types those mails include.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
