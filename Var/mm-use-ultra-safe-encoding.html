If non-nil, use encodings aimed at Procrustean bed survival.</br>
</br>
This means that textual parts are encoded as quoted-printable if they</br>
contain lines longer than 76 characters or starting with "From " in</br>
the body.  Non-7bit encodings (8bit, binary) are generally disallowed.</br>
This is to reduce the probability that a broken MTA or MDA changes the</br>
message.</br>
</br>
This variable should never be set directly, but bound before a call to</br>
`mml-generate-mime' or similar functions.
