Documentation:<br/>
Alist of MIME types or regexps matching file names and default dispositions.<br/>
Each element should be one of the following three forms:<br/>
<br/>
  (REGEXP . DISPOSITION)<br/>
  (SUPERTYPE (SUBTYPE . DISPOSITION) (SUBTYPE . DISPOSITION)...)<br/>
  (TYPE . DISPOSITION)<br/>
<br/>
Where REGEXP is a string which matches the file name (if any) of an<br/>
attachment, SUPERTYPE, SUBTYPE and TYPE should be symbols which are a<br/>
MIME supertype (e.g., text), a MIME subtype (e.g., plain) and a MIME<br/>
type (e.g., text/plain) respectively, and DISPOSITION should be either<br/>
the string "attachment" or the string "inline".  The value t for<br/>
SUPERTYPE, SUBTYPE or TYPE matches any of those types.  The first<br/>
match found will be used.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
