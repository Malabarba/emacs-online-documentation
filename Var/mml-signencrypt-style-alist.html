Documentation:<br/>
Alist specifying if `signencrypt' results in two separate operations or not.<br/>
The first entry indicates the MML security type, valid entries include<br/>
the strings "smime", "pgp", and "pgpmime".  The second entry is<br/>
a symbol `separate' or `combined' where `separate' means that MML signs<br/>
and encrypt messages in a two step process, and `combined' means that MML<br/>
signs and encrypt the message in one step.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the output generated by using a `combined' mode is NOT<br/>
understood by all PGP implementations, in particular PGP version<br/>
2 does not support it!  See Info node `(message)Security' for<br/>
details.<br/>
