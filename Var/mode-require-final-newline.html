mode-require-final-newline is a variable defined in `files.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Whether to add a newline at end of file, in certain major modes.<br/>Those modes set `require-final-newline' to this value when you enable them.<br/>They do so because they are often used for files that are supposed<br/>to end in newlines, and the question is how to arrange that.<br/><br/>A value of t means do this only when the file is about to be saved.<br/>A value of `visit' means do this right after the file is visited.<br/>A value of `visit-save' means do it at both of those times.<br/>Any other non-nil value means ask user whether to add a newline, when saving.<br/><br/>A value of nil means do not add newlines.  That is a risky choice in this<br/>variable since this value is used for modes for files that ought to have<br/>final newlines.  So if you set this to nil, you must explicitly check and<br/>add a final newline, whenever you save a file that really needs one.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
