Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Whether to add a newline at end of file, in certain major modes.</br>
Those modes set `require-final-newline' to this value when you enable them.</br>
They do so because they are often used for files that are supposed</br>
to end in newlines, and the question is how to arrange that.</br>
</br>
A value of t means do this only when the file is about to be saved.</br>
A value of `visit' means do this right after the file is visited.</br>
A value of `visit-save' means do it at both of those times.</br>
Any other non-nil value means ask user whether to add a newline, when saving.</br>
</br>
A value of nil means do not add newlines.  That is a risky choice in this</br>
variable since this value is used for modes for files that ought to have</br>
final newlines.  So if you set this to nil, you must explicitly check and</br>
add a final newline, whenever you save a file that really needs one.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
