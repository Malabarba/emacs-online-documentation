mouse-1-click-follows-link is a variable defined in `mouse.el'.<br/>Its value is 450<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means that clicking Mouse-1 on a link follows the link.<br/><br/>With the default setting, an ordinary Mouse-1 click on a link<br/>performs the same action as Mouse-2 on that link, while a longer<br/>Mouse-1 click (hold down the Mouse-1 button for more than 450<br/>milliseconds) performs the original Mouse-1 binding (which<br/>typically sets point where you click the mouse).<br/><br/>If value is an integer, the time elapsed between pressing and<br/>releasing the mouse button determines whether to follow the link<br/>or perform the normal Mouse-1 action (typically set point).<br/>The absolute numeric value specifies the maximum duration of a<br/>"short click" in milliseconds.  A positive value means that a<br/>short click follows the link, and a longer click performs the<br/>normal action.  A negative value gives the opposite behavior.<br/><br/>If value is `double', a double click follows the link.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a single Mouse-1 click unconditionally follows the link.<br/><br/>Note that dragging the mouse never follows the link.<br/><br/>This feature only works in modes that specifically identify<br/>clickable text as links, so it may not work with some external<br/>packages.  See `mouse-on-link-p' for details.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
