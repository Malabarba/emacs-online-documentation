mouse-autoselect-window is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means autoselect window with mouse pointer.<br/>If nil, do not autoselect windows.<br/>A positive number means delay autoselection by that many seconds: a<br/>window is autoselected only after the mouse has remained in that<br/>window for the duration of the delay.<br/>A negative number has a similar effect, but causes windows to be<br/>autoselected only after the mouse has stopped moving.  (Because of<br/>the way Emacs compares mouse events, you will occasionally wait twice<br/>that time before the window gets selected.)<br/>Any other value means to autoselect window instantaneously when the<br/>mouse pointer enters it.<br/><br/>Autoselection selects the minibuffer only if it is active, and never<br/>unselects the minibuffer if it is active.<br/><br/>When customizing this variable make sure that the actual value of<br/>`focus-follows-mouse' matches the behavior of your window manager.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
