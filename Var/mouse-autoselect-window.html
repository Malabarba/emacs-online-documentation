Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means autoselect window with mouse pointer.</br>
If nil, do not autoselect windows.</br>
A positive number means delay autoselection by that many seconds: a</br>
window is autoselected only after the mouse has remained in that</br>
window for the duration of the delay.</br>
A negative number has a similar effect, but causes windows to be</br>
autoselected only after the mouse has stopped moving.  (Because of</br>
the way Emacs compares mouse events, you will occasionally wait twice</br>
that time before the window gets selected.)</br>
Any other value means to autoselect window instantaneously when the</br>
mouse pointer enters it.</br>
</br>
Autoselection selects the minibuffer only if it is active, and never</br>
unselects the minibuffer if it is active.</br>
</br>
When customizing this variable make sure that the actual value of</br>
`focus-follows-mouse' matches the behavior of your window manager.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
