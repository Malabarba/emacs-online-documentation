<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The pause between scroll steps caused by mouse drags, in seconds.</br>
If you drag the mouse beyond the edge of a window, Emacs scrolls the</br>
window to bring the text beyond that edge into view, with a delay of</br>
this many seconds between scroll steps.  Scrolling stops when you move</br>
the mouse back into the window, or release the button.</br>
This variable's value may be non-integral.</br>
Setting this to zero causes Emacs to scroll as fast as it can.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
