Event that should be temporarily inhibited after mouse scrolling.</br>
The mouse wheel is typically on the mouse-2 button, so it may easily</br>
happen that text is accidentally yanked into the buffer when</br>
scrolling with the mouse wheel.  To prevent that, this variable can be</br>
set to the event sent when clicking on the mouse wheel button.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
