Its value is <pre>10</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The maximum number of items from different directories.</br>
</br>
When the menu is of type `file by directory', this is the maximum</br>
number of buffers that are clumped together from different</br>
directories.</br>
</br>
Set this to 1 if you want one menu per directory instead of clumping</br>
them together.</br>
</br>
If the value is not a number, then the value 10 is used.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
