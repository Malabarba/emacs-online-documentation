<strong>mspools-vm-system-mail</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mspools.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "/var/mail/tester"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Spool file for main mailbox.  Only used by VM.<br/>
This needs to be set to your primary mail spool - mspools will not run<br/>
without it.  By default this will be set to the environment variable<br/>
$MAIL.  Otherwise it will use `rmail-spool-directory' to guess where<br/>
your primary spool is.  If this fails, set it to something like<br/>
/usr/spool/mail/login-name.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
