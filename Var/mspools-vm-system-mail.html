<strong>mspools-vm-system-mail</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>mspools.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"/var/spool/mail/artur"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Spool file for main mailbox.  Only used by VM.</br>
This needs to be set to your primary mail spool - mspools will not run</br>
without it.  By default this will be set to the environment variable</br>
$MAIL.  Otherwise it will use `rmail-spool-directory' to guess where</br>
your primary spool is.  If this fails, set it to something like</br>
/usr/spool/mail/login-name.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
