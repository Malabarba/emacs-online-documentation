mspools-vm-system-mail is a variable defined in `mspools.el'.<br/>Its value is "/var/spool/mail/artur"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Spool file for main mailbox.  Only used by VM.<br/>This needs to be set to your primary mail spool - mspools will not run<br/>without it.  By default this will be set to the environment variable<br/>$MAIL.  Otherwise it will use `rmail-spool-directory' to guess where<br/>your primary spool is.  If this fails, set it to something like<br/>/usr/spool/mail/login-name.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
