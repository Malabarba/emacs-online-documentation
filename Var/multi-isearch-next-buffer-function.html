multi-isearch-next-buffer-function is a variable defined in `misearch.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Function to call to get the next buffer to search.<br/><br/>When this variable is set to a function that returns a buffer, then<br/>after typing another C-s or C-r at a failing search, the search goes<br/>to the next buffer in the series and continues searching for the<br/>next occurrence.<br/><br/>This function should return the next buffer (it doesn't need to switch<br/>to it), or nil if it can't find the next buffer (when it reaches the<br/>end of the search space).<br/><br/>The first argument of this function is the current buffer where the<br/>search is currently searching.  It defines the base buffer relative to<br/>which this function should find the next buffer.  When the isearch<br/>direction is backward (when `isearch-forward' is nil), this function<br/>should return the previous buffer to search.<br/><br/>If the second argument of this function WRAP is non-nil, then it<br/>should return the first buffer in the series; and for the backward<br/>search, it should return the last buffer in the series.
