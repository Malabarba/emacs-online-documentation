Keymap that defines additional bindings for multi-buffer replacements.</br>
It extends its parent map `query-replace-map' with new bindings to</br>
operate on a set of buffers/files.  The difference with its parent map</br>
is the additional answers `automatic-all' to replace all remaining</br>
matches in all remaining buffers with no more questions, and</br>
`exit-current' to skip remaining matches in the current buffer</br>
and to continue with the next buffer in the sequence.</br>
