How secure the network should be.</br>
If a potential problem with the security of the network</br>
connection is found, the user is asked to give input into how the</br>
connection should be handled.</br>
</br>
The following values are possible:</br>
</br>
`low': Absolutely no checks are performed.</br>
`medium': This is the default level, should be reasonable for most usage.</br>
`high': This warns about additional things that many people would</br>
not find useful.</br>
`paranoid': On this level, the user is queried for most new connections.</br>
</br>
See the Emacs manual for a description of all things that are</br>
checked and warned against.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
