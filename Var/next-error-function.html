Function to use to find the next error in the current buffer.</br>
The function is called with 2 parameters:</br>
ARG is an integer specifying by how many errors to move.</br>
RESET is a boolean which, if non-nil, says to go back to the beginning</br>
of the errors before moving.</br>
Major modes providing compile-like functionality should set this variable</br>
to indicate to `next-error' that this is a candidate buffer and how</br>
to navigate in it.
