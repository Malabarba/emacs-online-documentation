*Variable that says where expired messages should end up.</br>
The default value is `delete' (which says to delete the messages),</br>
but it can also be a string or a function.  If it is a string, expired</br>
messages end up in that group.  If it is a function, the function is</br>
called in a buffer narrowed to the message in question.  The function</br>
receives one argument, the name of the group the message comes from.</br>
The return value should be `delete' or a group name (a string).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
