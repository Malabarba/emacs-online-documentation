*Hook that will be run after the incoming mail has been transferred.</br>
The incoming mail is moved from the specified spool file (which normally is</br>
something like "/usr/spool/mail/$user") to the user's home</br>
directory.  This hook is called after the incoming mail box has been</br>
emptied, and can be used to call any mail box programs you have</br>
running ("xwatch", etc.)</br>
</br>
E.g.:</br>
</br>
(add-hook 'nnmail-read-incoming-hook</br>
	  (lambda ()</br>
	    (call-process "/local/bin/mailsend" nil nil nil</br>
			  "read"</br>
			  ;; The incoming mail box file.</br>
			  (expand-file-name (user-login-name)</br>
					    rmail-spool-directory))))</br>
</br>
If you have xwatch running, this will alert it that mail has been</br>
read.</br>
</br>
If you use `display-time', you could use something like this:</br>
</br>
(add-hook 'nnmail-read-incoming-hook</br>
	  (lambda ()</br>
	    ;; Update the displayed time, since that will clear out</br>
	    ;; the flag that says you have mail.</br>
	    (when (eq (process-status "display-time") 'run)</br>
	      (display-time-filter display-time-process ""))))</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
