<strong>nnmail-split-methods</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>nnmail.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is (("mail.misc" ""))<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
*Incoming mail will be split according to this variable.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like, for instance, one mail group for mail from the<br/>
"4ad-l" mailing list, one group for junk mail and one for everything<br/>
else, you could do something like this:<br/>
<br/>
 (setq nnmail-split-methods<br/>
       '(("mail.4ad" "From:.*4ad")<br/>
	 ("mail.junk" "From:.*Lars\\|Subject:.*buy")<br/>
	 ("mail.misc" "")))<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, this variable is a list of lists, where the first<br/>
element in each "rule" is the name of the group (which, by the way,<br/>
does not have to be called anything beginning with "mail",<br/>
"yonka.zow" is a fine, fine name), and the second is a regexp that<br/>
nnmail will try to match on the header to find a fit.<br/>
<br/>
The second element can also be a function.  In that case, it will be<br/>
called narrowed to the headers with the first element of the rule as<br/>
the argument.  It should return a non-nil value if it thinks that the<br/>
mail belongs in that group.<br/>
<br/>
The last element should always have "" as the regexp.<br/>
<br/>
This variable can also have a function as its value, and it can<br/>
also have a fancy split method as its value.  See<br/>
`nnmail-split-fancy' for an explanation of that syntax.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
