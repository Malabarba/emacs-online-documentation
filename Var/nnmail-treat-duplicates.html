*If non-nil, nnmail keep a cache of Message-IDs to discover mail duplicates.</br>
Three values are valid: nil, which means that nnmail is not to keep a</br>
Message-ID cache; `warn', which means that nnmail should insert extra</br>
headers to warn the user about the duplication (this is the default);</br>
and `delete', which means that nnmail will delete duplicated mails.</br>
</br>
This variable can also be a function.  It will be called from a buffer</br>
narrowed to the article in question with the Message-ID as a</br>
parameter.  It should return nil, `warn' or `delete'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
