Whether the currently executing code is performing an essential task.</br>
This variable should be non-nil only when running code which should not</br>
disturb the user.  E.g. it can be used to prevent Tramp from prompting the</br>
user for a password when we are simply scanning a set of files in the</br>
background or displaying possible completions before the user even asked</br>
for it.
