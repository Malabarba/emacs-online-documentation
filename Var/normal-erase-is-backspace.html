<strong>normal-erase-is-backspace</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>maybe</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Set the default behavior of the Delete and Backspace keys.</br>
</br>
If set to t, Delete key deletes forward and Backspace key deletes</br>
backward.</br>
</br>
If set to nil, both Delete and Backspace keys delete backward.</br>
</br>
If set to 'maybe (which is the default), Emacs automatically</br>
selects a behavior.  On window systems, the behavior depends on</br>
the keyboard used.  If the keyboard has both a Backspace key and</br>
a Delete key, and both are mapped to their usual meanings, the</br>
option's default value is set to t, so that Backspace can be used</br>
to delete backward, and Delete can be used to delete forward.</br>
</br>
If not running under a window system, customizing this option</br>
accomplishes a similar effect by mapping C-h, which is usually</br>
generated by the Backspace key, to DEL, and by mapping DEL to C-d</br>
via `keyboard-translate'.  The former functionality of C-h is</br>
available on the F1 key.  You should probably not use this</br>
setting if you don't have both Backspace, Delete and F1 keys.</br>
</br>
Setting this variable with setq doesn't take effect.  Programmatically,</br>
call `normal-erase-is-backspace-mode' (which see) instead.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
