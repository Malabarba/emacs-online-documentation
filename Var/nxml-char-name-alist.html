<strong>nxml-char-name-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>nxml-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist of character names.<br/>
Each member of the list has the form (NAME CODE . NAMESET),<br/>
where NAME is a string naming a character, NAMESET is a symbol<br/>
identifying a set of names and CODE is an integer specifying the<br/>
Unicode scalar value of the named character.<br/>
The NAME will only be used for completion if NAMESET has<br/>
a non-nil `nxml-char-name-set-enabled' property.<br/>
If NAMESET does does not have `nxml-char-name-set-defined' property,<br/>
then it must have a `nxml-char-name-set-file' property and `load'<br/>
will be applied to the value of this property if the nameset<br/>
is enabled.
