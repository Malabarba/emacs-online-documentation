Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Used by `nxml-glyph-set-functions' to return set of glyphs in a FACE.<br/>
This should dynamically bound by any function that runs<br/>
`nxml-glyph-set-functions'.  The value must be either nil representing an<br/>
empty set or a vector. Each member of the vector is either a single<br/>
integer or a cons (FIRST . LAST) representing the range of integers<br/>
from FIRST to LAST.  An integer represents a glyph with that Unicode<br/>
code-point.  The vector must be ordered.
