restored without copying.</br>

N + 1 where N is the number of open elements.  Each member of the</br>
list represents the bindings in effect for a particular element.</br>
Each member is itself a list whose car is the default namespace</br>
(a symbol or nil) and whose cdr is an alist of (PREFIX . NS) pairs</br>
where PREFIX is a string (never nil) and NS is the namespace URI</br>
symbol.
