Documentation:<br/>
Marker giving position up to which we have scanned.<br/>
nxml-scan-end must be >= nxml-prolog-end.  Furthermore, nxml-scan-end<br/>
must not be an inside position in the following sense.  A position is<br/>
inside if the following character is a part of, but not the first<br/>
character of, a CDATA section, comment or processing instruction.<br/>
Furthermore all positions >= nxml-prolog-end and < nxml-scan-end that<br/>
are inside positions must have a non-nil `nxml-inside' property whose<br/>
value is a symbol specifying what it is inside.  Any characters with a<br/>
non-nil `fontified' property must have position < nxml-scan-end and<br/>
the correct face.  Dependent regions must also be established for any<br/>
unclosed constructs starting before nxml-scan-end.<br/>
There must be no `nxml-inside' properties after nxml-scan-end.
