<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Either nil or a function called by `nxml-parse-file' to perform validation.<br/>
The function will be called once for each start-tag or end-tag.  The<br/>
function is passed two arguments TEXT and START-TAG.  For a start-tag,<br/>
START-TAG is a list (NAME ATTRIBUTES) where NAME and ATTRIBUTES are in<br/>
the same form as returned by `nxml-parse-file'.  For an end-tag,<br/>
START-TAG is nil.  TEXT is a string containing the text immediately<br/>
preceding the tag, or nil if there was no such text.  An empty element<br/>
is treated as a start-tag followed by an end-tag.<br/>
<br/>
For a start-tag, the namespace state will be the state after<br/>
processing the namespace declarations in the start-tag.  For an<br/>
end-tag, the namespace state will be the state before popping the<br/>
namespace declarations for the corresponding start-tag.<br/>
<br/>
The function must return nil if no error is detected or a<br/>
cons (MESSAGE . LOCATION) where MESSAGE is a string containing<br/>
an error message and LOCATION indicates what caused the error<br/>
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
- nil indicates the tag as whole caused it; this is always allowed;<br/>
<br/>
- text indicates the text caused it; this is allowed only if<br/>
TEXT is non-nil;<br/>
<br/>
- tag-close indicates the close of the tag caused it; this is<br/>
allowed only if START-TAG is non-nil;<br/>
<br/>
- (attribute-name . N) indicates that the name of the Nth attribute<br/>
caused it; N counts from 0; this is allowed only if START-TAG is non-nil<br/>
and N must be less than the number of attributes;<br/>
<br/>
- (attribute-value . N) indicates that the value of the Nth attribute<br/>
caused it; N counts from 0; this is allowed only if START-TAG is non-nil<br/>
and N must be less than the number of attributes.
