Its value is <pre>("[[:upper:]]\\sw*[[:lower:]]\\sw*")</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
*List of extra types (aside from the type keywords) to recognize in ObjC mode.</br>
Each list item should be a regexp matching a single identifier.</br>
For example, a value of ("[[:upper:]]\\sw*[[:lower:]]\\sw*") means</br>
capitalized words are treated as type names (the requirement for a</br>
lower case char is to avoid recognizing all-caps macro and constant</br>
names).</br>
</br>
Note that items on this list that don't include any regexp special</br>
characters are automatically optimized using `regexp-opt', so you</br>
should not use `regexp-opt' explicitly to build regexps here.</br>
</br>
On decoration level 3 (and higher, where applicable), a method is used</br>
that finds most types and declarations by syntax alone.  This variable</br>
is still used as a first step, but other types are recognized</br>
correctly anyway in most cases.  Therefore this variable should be</br>
fairly restrictive and not contain patterns that are uncertain.</br>
</br>
Note that this variable is only consulted when the major mode is</br>
initialized.  If you change it later you have to reinitialize CC Mode</br>
by doing M-x objc-mode.</br>
</br>
Despite the name, this variable is not only used for font locking but</br>
also elsewhere in CC Mode to tell types from other identifiers.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
