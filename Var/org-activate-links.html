Types of links that should be activated in Org-mode files.</br>
This is a list of symbols, each leading to the activation of a certain link</br>
type.  In principle, it does not hurt to turn on most link types - there may</br>
be a small gain when turning off unused link types.  The types are:</br>
</br>
bracket   The recommended [[link][description]] or [[link]] links with hiding.</br>
angle     Links in angular brackets that may contain whitespace like</br>
          <bbdb:Carsten Dominik>.</br>
plain     Plain links in normal text, no whitespace, like http://google.com.</br>
radio     Text that is matched by a radio target, see manual for details.</br>
tag       Tag settings in a headline (link to tag search).</br>
date      Time stamps (link to calendar).</br>
footnote  Footnote labels.</br>
