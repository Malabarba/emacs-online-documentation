<strong>org-adapt-indentation</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means adapt indentation to outline node level.</br>
</br>
When this variable is set, Org assumes that you write outlines by</br>
indenting text in each node to align with the headline (after the stars).</br>
The following issues are influenced by this variable:</br>
</br>
- When this is set and the *entire* text in an entry is indented, the</br>
  indentation is increased by one space in a demotion command, and</br>
  decreased by one in a promotion command.  If any line in the entry</br>
  body starts with text at column 0, indentation is not changed at all.</br>
</br>
- Property drawers and planning information is inserted indented when</br>
  this variable s set.  When nil, they will not be indented.</br>
</br>
- TAB indents a line relative to context.  The lines below a headline</br>
  will be indented when this variable is set.</br>
</br>
Note that this is all about true indentation, by adding and removing</br>
space characters.  See also `org-indent.el' which does level-dependent</br>
indentation in a virtual way, i.e. at display time in Emacs.</br>

You can customize this variable.
