Hook that is called after a TODO statistics cookie has been updated.</br>
Each function is called with two arguments: the number of not-done entries</br>
and the number of done entries.</br>
</br>
For example, the following function, when added to this hook, will switch</br>
an entry to DONE when all children are done, and back to TODO when new</br>
entries are set to a TODO status.  Note that this hook is only called</br>
when there is a statistics cookie in the headline!</br>
</br>
 (defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)</br>

   (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging</br>
     (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))</br>
