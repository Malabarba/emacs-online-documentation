This is only relevant when `org-agenda-add-entry-text' is part of</br>
`org-agenda-before-write-hook', which is the default.</br>
When this is 0, nothing will happen.  When it is greater than 0, it</br>
specifies the maximum number of lines that will be added for each entry</br>
that is listed in the agenda view.</br>

Note that this variable is not used during display, only when exporting</br>
the agenda.  For agenda display, see the variables `org-agenda-entry-text-mode'</br>
