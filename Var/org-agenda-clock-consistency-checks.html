This is a property list, with the following keys:<br/>
<br/>
:max-duration    Mark clocking chunks that are longer than this time.<br/>
                 This is a time string like "HH:MM", or the number<br/>
                 of minutes as an integer.<br/>
<br/>
:min-duration    Mark clocking chunks that are shorter that this.<br/>
                 This is a time string like "HH:MM", or the number<br/>
                 of minutes as an integer.<br/>
<br/>
:max-gap         Mark gaps between clocking chunks that are longer than<br/>
                 this duration.  A number of minutes, or a string<br/>
                 like "HH:MM".<br/>
<br/>
:gap-ok-around   List of times during the day which are usually not working<br/>
                 times.  When a gap is detected, but the gap contains any<br/>
                 of these times, the gap is *not* reported.  For example,<br/>
                 if this is ("4:00" "13:00") then gaps that contain<br/>
                 4:00 in the morning (i.e. the night) and 13:00<br/>
                 (i.e. a typical lunch time) do not cause a warning.<br/>
                 You should have at least one time during the night in this<br/>
                 list, or otherwise the first task each morning will trigger<br/>
                 a warning because it follows a long gap.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the following properties can be used to define faces for<br/>
issue display.<br/>
<br/>
:default-face         the default face, if the specific face is undefined<br/>
:overlap-face         face for overlapping clocks<br/>
:gap-face             face for gaps between clocks<br/>
:no-end-time-face     face for incomplete clocks<br/>
:long-face            face for clock intervals that are too long<br/>
:short-face           face for clock intervals that are too short<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
