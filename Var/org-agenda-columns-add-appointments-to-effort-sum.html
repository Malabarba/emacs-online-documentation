Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means the duration of an appointment will add to day effort.<br/>
The property to which appointment durations will be added is the one given<br/>
in the option `org-effort-property'.  If an appointment does not have<br/>
an end time, `org-agenda-default-appointment-duration' will be used.  If that<br/>

estimate.<br/>
