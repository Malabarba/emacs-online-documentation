Non-nil means recompute all summary properties before column view.</br>
When column view in the agenda is listing properties that have a summary</br>
operator, it can go to all relevant buffers and recompute the summaries</br>
there.  This can mean overhead for the agenda column view, but is necessary</br>
to have thing up to date.</br>
As a special case, a CLOCKSUM property also makes sure that the clock</br>
computations are current.</br>

You can customize this variable.
