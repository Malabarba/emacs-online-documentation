<strong>org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist of custom agenda keys and contextual rules.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you have a custom agenda command "p" and you<br/>
want this command to be accessible only from plain text files,<br/>
use this:<br/>
<br/>
   '(("p" ((in-file . "\.txt"))))<br/>
<br/>
Here are the available contexts definitions:<br/>
<br/>
      in-file: command displayed only in matching files<br/>
      in-mode: command displayed only in matching modes<br/>
  not-in-file: command not displayed in matching files<br/>
  not-in-mode: command not displayed in matching modes<br/>
   [function]: a custom function taking no argument<br/>
<br/>
If you define several checks, the agenda command will be<br/>
accessible if there is at least one valid check.<br/>
<br/>
You can also bind a key to another agenda custom command<br/>
depending on contextual rules.<br/>
<br/>
    '(("p" "q" ((in-file . "\.txt"))))<br/>
<br/>
Here it means: in .txt files, use "p" as the key for the<br/>
agenda command otherwise associated with "q".  (The command<br/>
originally associated with "q" is not displayed to avoid<br/>
duplicates.)<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.3 of Emacs.<br/>
