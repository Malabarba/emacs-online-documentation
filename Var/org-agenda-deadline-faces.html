Faces for showing deadlines in the agenda.</br>
This is a list of cons cells.  The cdr of each cell is a face to be used,</br>
and it can also just be like '(:foreground "yellow").</br>
Each car is a fraction of the head-warning time that must have passed for</br>
this the face in the cdr to be used for display.  The numbers must be</br>
given in descending order.  The head-warning time is normally taken</br>
from `org-deadline-warning-days', but can also be specified in the deadline</br>
timestamp itself, like this:</br>
</br>
   DEADLINE: <2007-08-13 Mon -8d></br>
</br>
You may use d for days, w for weeks, m for months and y for years.  Months</br>
and years will only be treated in an approximate fashion (30.4 days for a</br>
month and 365.24 days for a year).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
