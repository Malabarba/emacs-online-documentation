Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means dim blocked tasks in the agenda display.</br>
This causes some overhead during agenda construction, but if you</br>
have turned on `org-enforce-todo-dependencies',</br>
`org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies', or any other blocking</br>
mechanism, this will create useful feedback in the agenda.</br>
</br>
Instead of t, this variable can also have the value `invisible'.</br>
Then blocked tasks will be invisible and only become visible when</br>
they become unblocked.  An exemption to this behavior is when a task is</br>
blocked because of unchecked checkboxes below it.  Since checkboxes do</br>
not show up in the agenda views, making this task invisible you remove any</br>
trace from agenda views that there is something to do.  Therefore, a task</br>
that is blocked because of checkboxes will never be made invisible, it</br>
will only be dimmed.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
