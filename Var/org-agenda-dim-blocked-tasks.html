org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks is a variable defined in `org-agenda.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means dim blocked tasks in the agenda display.<br/>This causes some overhead during agenda construction, but if you<br/>have turned on `org-enforce-todo-dependencies',<br/>`org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies', or any other blocking<br/>mechanism, this will create useful feedback in the agenda.<br/><br/>Instead of t, this variable can also have the value `invisible'.<br/>Then blocked tasks will be invisible and only become visible when<br/>they become unblocked.  An exemption to this behavior is when a task is<br/>blocked because of unchecked checkboxes below it.  Since checkboxes do<br/>not show up in the agenda views, making this task invisible you remove any<br/>trace from agenda views that there is something to do.  Therefore, a task<br/>that is blocked because of checkboxes will never be made invisible, it<br/>will only be dimmed.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 24.3 of Emacs.<br/>
