List of types searched for when creating the daily/weekly agenda.</br>
This variable is a list of symbols that controls the types of</br>
items that appear in the daily/weekly agenda.  Allowed symbols in this</br>
list are are</br>
</br>
  :timestamp   List items containing a date stamp or date range matching</br>
               the selected date.  This includes sexp entries in angular</br>
               brackets.</br>
</br>
  :sexp        List entries resulting from plain diary-like sexps.</br>
</br>
  :deadline    List deadline due on that date.  When the date is today,</br>
               also list any deadlines past due, or due within</br>
	       `org-deadline-warning-days'.  `:deadline' must appear before</br>
               `:scheduled' if the setting of</br>
               `org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown' is to have</br>
               any effect.</br>
</br>
  :deadline*   Same as above, but only include the deadline if it has an</br>
               hour specification as [h]h:mm.</br>
</br>
  :scheduled   List all items which are scheduled for the given date.</br>
	       The diary for *today* also contains items which were</br>
	       scheduled earlier and are not yet marked DONE.</br>
</br>
  :scheduled*  Same as above, but only include the scheduled item if it</br>
               has an hour specification as [h]h:mm.</br>
</br>
By default, all four non-starred types are turned on.</br>
</br>
When :scheduled* or :deadline* are included, :schedule or :deadline</br>
will be ignored.</br>
</br>
Never set this variable globally using `setq', because then it</br>
will apply to all future agenda commands.  Instead, bind it with</br>
`let' to scope it dynamically into the agenda-constructing</br>
command.  A good way to set it is through options in</br>
`org-agenda-custom-commands'.  For a more flexible (though</br>
somewhat less efficient) way of determining what is included in</br>
the daily/weekly agenda, see `org-agenda-skip-function'.
