<strong>org-agenda-filter-preset</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable is an alias for `org-agenda-tag-filter-preset'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
A preset of the tags filter used for secondary agenda filtering.<br/>
This must be a list of strings, each string must be a single tag preceded<br/>
by "+" or "-".<br/>
This variable should not be set directly, but agenda custom commands can<br/>
bind it in the options section.  The preset filter is a global property of<br/>
the entire agenda view.  In a block agenda, it will not work reliably to<br/>
define a filter for one of the individual blocks.  You need to set it in<br/>
the global options and expect it to be applied to the entire view.
