</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means show the match string in the agenda dispatcher menu.</br>
When nil, the matcher string is not shown, but is put into the help-echo</br>
property so than moving the mouse over the command shows it.</br>
Setting it to nil is good if matcher strings are very long and/or if</br>
you want to use two-columns display (see `org-agenda-menu-two-columns').</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
