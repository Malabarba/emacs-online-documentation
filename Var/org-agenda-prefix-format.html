Format specifications for the prefix of items in the agenda views.</br>
An alist with five entries, each for the different agenda types.  The</br>
keys of the sublists are `agenda', `timeline', `todo', `search' and `tags'.</br>
The values are format strings.</br>
</br>
This format works similar to a printf format, with the following meaning:</br>
</br>
  %c   the category of the item, "Diary" for entries from the diary,</br>
       or as given by the CATEGORY keyword or derived from the file name</br>
  %e   the effort required by the item</br>
  %l   the level of the item (insert X space(s) if item is of level X)</br>
  %i   the icon category of the item, see `org-agenda-category-icon-alist'</br>
  %T   the last tag of the item (ignore inherited tags, which come first)</br>
  %t   the HH:MM time-of-day specification if one applies to the entry</br>
  %s   Scheduling/Deadline information, a short string</br>
  %b   show breadcrumbs, i.e., the names of the higher levels</br>
  %(expression) Eval EXPRESSION and replace the control string</br>
                by the result</br>
</br>
All specifiers work basically like the standard `%s' of printf, but may</br>
contain two additional characters: a question mark just after the `%'</br>
and a whitespace/punctuation character just before the final letter.</br>
</br>
If the first character after `%' is a question mark, the entire field</br>
will only be included if the corresponding value applies to the current</br>
entry.  This is useful for fields which should have fixed width when</br>
present, but zero width when absent.  For example, "%?-12t" will</br>
result in a 12 character time field if a time of the day is specified,</br>
but will completely disappear in entries which do not contain a time.</br>
</br>
If there is punctuation or whitespace character just before the</br>
final format letter, this character will be appended to the field</br>
value if the value is not empty.  For example, the format</br>
"%-12:c" leads to "Diary: " if the category is "Diary".  If</br>
the category is empty, no additional colon is inserted.</br>
</br>
The default value for the agenda sublist is "  %-12:c%?-12t% s",</br>
which means:</br>
</br>
- Indent the line with two space characters</br>
- Give the category a 12 chars wide field, padded with whitespace on</br>
  the right (because of `-').  Append a colon if there is a category</br>
  (because of `:').</br>
- If there is a time-of-day, put it into a 12 chars wide field.  If no</br>
  time, don't put in an empty field, just skip it (because of '?').</br>
- Finally, put the scheduling information.</br>
