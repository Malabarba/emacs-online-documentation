org-agenda-prefix-format is a variable defined in `org-agenda.el'.<br/>Its value is ((agenda . " %i %-12:c%?-12t% s")<br/> (timeline . "  % s")<br/> (todo . " %i %-12:c")<br/> (tags . " %i %-12:c")<br/> (search . " %i %-12:c"))<br/><br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Format specifications for the prefix of items in the agenda views.<br/>An alist with five entries, each for the different agenda types.  The<br/>keys of the sublists are `agenda', `timeline', `todo', `search' and `tags'.<br/>The values are format strings.<br/><br/>This format works similar to a printf format, with the following meaning:<br/><br/>  %c   the category of the item, "Diary" for entries from the diary,<br/>       or as given by the CATEGORY keyword or derived from the file name<br/>  %e   the effort required by the item<br/>  %i   the icon category of the item, see `org-agenda-category-icon-alist'<br/>  %T   the last tag of the item (ignore inherited tags, which come first)<br/>  %t   the HH:MM time-of-day specification if one applies to the entry<br/>  %s   Scheduling/Deadline information, a short string<br/>  %(expression) Eval EXPRESSION and replace the control string<br/>                by the result<br/><br/>All specifiers work basically like the standard `%s' of printf, but may<br/>contain two additional characters:  a question mark just after the `%'<br/>and a whitespace/punctuation character just before the final letter.<br/><br/>If the first character after `%' is a question mark, the entire field<br/>will only be included if the corresponding value applies to the current<br/>entry.  This is useful for fields which should have fixed width when<br/>present, but zero width when absent.  For example, "%?-12t" will<br/>result in a 12 character time field if a time of the day is specified,<br/>but will completely disappear in entries which do not contain a time.<br/><br/>If there is punctuation or whitespace character just before the final<br/>format letter, this character will be appended to the field value if<br/>the value is not empty.  For example, the format "%-12:c" leads to<br/>"Diary: " if the category is "Diary".  If the category were be<br/>empty, no additional colon would be inserted.<br/><br/>The default value for the agenda sublist is "  %-12:c%?-12t% s",<br/>which means:<br/><br/>- Indent the line with two space characters<br/>- Give the category a 12 chars wide field, padded with whitespace on<br/>  the right (because of `-').  Append a colon if there is a category<br/>  (because of `:').<br/>- If there is a time-of-day, put it into a 12 chars wide field.  If no<br/>  time, don't put in an empty field, just skip it (because of '?').<br/>- Finally, put the scheduling information.<br/><br/>See also the variables `org-agenda-remove-times-when-in-prefix' and<br/>`org-agenda-remove-tags'.<br/><br/>Custom commands can set this variable in the options section.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
