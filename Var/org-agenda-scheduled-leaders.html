Text preceding scheduled items in the agenda view.</br>
This is a list with two strings.  The first applies when the item is</br>
scheduled on the current day.  The second applies when it has been scheduled</br>
previously, it may contain a %d indicating that this is the nth time that</br>
this item is scheduled, due to automatic rescheduling of unfinished items</br>
for the following day.  So this number is one larger than the number of days</br>
that passed since this item was scheduled first.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
