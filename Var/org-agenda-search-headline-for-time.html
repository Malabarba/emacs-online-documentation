Non-nil means search headline for a time-of-day.</br>
If the headline contains a time-of-day in one format or another, it will</br>
be used to sort the entry into the time sequence of items for a day.</br>
Some people have time stamps in the headline that refer to the creation</br>
time or so, and then this produces an unwanted side effect.  If this is</br>
the case for your, use this variable to turn off searching the headline</br>
for a time.</br>
