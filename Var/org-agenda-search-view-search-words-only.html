Non-nil means the search string is interpreted as individual parts.</br>
</br>
The search string for search view can either be interpreted as a phrase,</br>
or as a list of snippets that define a boolean search for a number of</br>
strings.</br>
</br>
When this is non-nil, the string will be split on whitespace, and each</br>
snippet will be searched individually, and all must match in order to</br>
select an entry.  A snippet is then a single string of non-white</br>
characters, or a string in double quotes, or a regexp in {} braces.</br>
If a snippet is preceded by "-", the snippet must *not* match.</br>
"+" is syntactic sugar for positive selection.  Each snippet may</br>
be found as a full word or a partial word, but see the variable</br>
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words'.</br>
</br>
When this is nil, search will look for the entire search phrase as one,</br>
with each space character matching any amount of whitespace, including</br>
line breaks.</br>
</br>
Even when this is nil, you can still switch to Boolean search dynamically</br>
by preceding the first snippet with "+" or "-".  If the first snippet</br>
is a regexp marked with braces like "{abc}", this will also switch to</br>
boolean search.</br>
