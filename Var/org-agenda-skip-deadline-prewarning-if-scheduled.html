org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled is a variable defined in `org-agenda.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means skip deadline prewarning when entry is also scheduled.<br/>This will apply on all days where a prewarning for the deadline would<br/>be shown, but not at the day when the entry is actually due.  On that day,<br/>the deadline will be shown anyway.<br/>This variable may be set to nil, t, or a number which will then give<br/>the number of days before the actual deadline when the prewarnings<br/>should resume.<br/>This can be used in a workflow where the first showing of the deadline will<br/>trigger you to schedule it, and then you don't want to be reminded of it<br/>because you will take care of it on the day when scheduled.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
