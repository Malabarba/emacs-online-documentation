<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means skip deadline prewarning when entry is also scheduled.</br>
This will apply on all days where a prewarning for the deadline would</br>
be shown, but not at the day when the entry is actually due.  On that day,</br>
the deadline will be shown anyway.</br>
This variable may be set to nil, t, the symbol `pre-scheduled',</br>
or a number which will then give the number of days before the actual</br>
deadline when the prewarnings should resume.  The symbol `pre-scheduled'</br>
eliminates the deadline prewarning only prior to the scheduled date.</br>
This can be used in a workflow where the first showing of the deadline will</br>
trigger you to schedule it, and then you don't want to be reminded of it</br>
because you will take care of it on the day when scheduled.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
