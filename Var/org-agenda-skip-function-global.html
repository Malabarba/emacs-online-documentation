<strong>org-agenda-skip-function-global</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Function to be called at each match during agenda construction.<br/>
If this function returns nil, the current match should not be skipped.<br/>
If the function decided to skip an agenda match, is must return the<br/>
buffer position from which the search should be continued.<br/>
This may also be a Lisp form, which will be evaluated.<br/>
<br/>
This variable will be applied to every agenda match, including<br/>
tags/property searches and TODO lists.  So try to make the test function<br/>
do its checking as efficiently as possible.  To implement a skipping<br/>
condition just for specific agenda commands, use the variable<br/>
`org-agenda-skip-function' which can be set in the options section<br/>
of custom agenda commands.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
