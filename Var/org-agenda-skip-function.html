<strong>org-agenda-skip-function</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Function to be called at each match during agenda construction.<br/>
If this function returns nil, the current match should not be skipped.<br/>
Otherwise, the function must return a position from where the search<br/>
should be continued.<br/>
This may also be a Lisp form, it will be evaluated.<br/>
Never set this variable using `setq' or so, because then it will apply<br/>
to all future agenda commands.  If you do want a global skipping condition,<br/>
use the option `org-agenda-skip-function-global' instead.<br/>
The correct usage for `org-agenda-skip-function' is to bind it with<br/>
`let' to scope it dynamically into the agenda-constructing command.<br/>
A good way to set it is through options in `org-agenda-custom-commands'.
