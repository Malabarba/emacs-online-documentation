<strong>org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means skip scheduling line if same entry shows because of deadline.<br/>
In the agenda of today, an entry can show up multiple times because<br/>
it is both scheduled and has a nearby deadline, and maybe a plain time<br/>
stamp as well.<br/>
When this variable is t, then only the deadline is shown and the fact that<br/>
the entry is scheduled today or was scheduled previously is not shown.<br/>
When this variable is nil, the entry will be shown several times.  When<br/>
the variable is the symbol `not-today', then skip scheduled previously,<br/>
but not scheduled today.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
