Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means skip scheduling line if same entry shows because of deadline.</br>
</br>
In the agenda of today, an entry can show up multiple times</br>
because it is both scheduled and has a nearby deadline, and maybe</br>
a plain time stamp as well.</br>
</br>
When this variable is nil, the entry will be shown several times.</br>
</br>
When set to t, then only the deadline is shown and the fact that</br>
the entry is scheduled today or was scheduled previously is not</br>
shown.</br>
</br>
When set to the symbol `not-today', skip scheduled previously,</br>
but not scheduled today.</br>
</br>
When set to the symbol `repeated-after-deadline', skip scheduled</br>
items if they are repeated beyond the current deadline.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
