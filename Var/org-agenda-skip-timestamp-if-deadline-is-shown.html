Non-nil means skip timestamp line if same entry shows because of deadline.</br>
In the agenda of today, an entry can show up multiple times</br>
because it has both a plain timestamp and has a nearby deadline.</br>
When this variable is t, then only the deadline is shown and the</br>
fact that the entry has a timestamp for or including today is not</br>
shown.  When this variable is nil, the entry will be shown</br>
several times.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
