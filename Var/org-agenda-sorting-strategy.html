Sorting structure for the agenda items of a single day.</br>
This is a list of symbols which will be used in sequence to determine</br>
if an entry should be listed before another entry.  The following</br>
symbols are recognized:</br>
</br>
time-up            Put entries with time-of-day indications first, early first</br>
time-down          Put entries with time-of-day indications first, late first</br>
timestamp-up       Sort by any timestamp, early first</br>
timestamp-down     Sort by any timestamp, late first</br>
scheduled-up       Sort by scheduled timestamp, early first</br>
scheduled-down     Sort by scheduled timestamp, late first</br>
deadline-up        Sort by deadline timestamp, early first</br>
deadline-down      Sort by deadline timestamp, late first</br>
ts-up              Sort by active timestamp, early first</br>
ts-down            Sort by active timestamp, late first</br>
tsia-up            Sort by inactive timestamp, early first</br>
tsia-down          Sort by inactive timestamp, late first</br>
category-keep      Keep the default order of categories, corresponding to the</br>
		   sequence in `org-agenda-files'.</br>
category-up        Sort alphabetically by category, A-Z.</br>
category-down      Sort alphabetically by category, Z-A.</br>
tag-up             Sort alphabetically by last tag, A-Z.</br>
tag-down           Sort alphabetically by last tag, Z-A.</br>
priority-up        Sort numerically by priority, high priority last.</br>
priority-down      Sort numerically by priority, high priority first.</br>
todo-state-up      Sort by todo state, tasks that are done last.</br>
todo-state-down    Sort by todo state, tasks that are done first.</br>
effort-up          Sort numerically by estimated effort, high effort last.</br>
effort-down        Sort numerically by estimated effort, high effort first.</br>
user-defined-up    Sort according to `org-agenda-cmp-user-defined', high last.</br>
user-defined-down  Sort according to `org-agenda-cmp-user-defined', high first.</br>
habit-up           Put entries that are habits first</br>
habit-down         Put entries that are habits last</br>
alpha-up           Sort headlines alphabetically</br>
alpha-down         Sort headlines alphabetically, reversed</br>
</br>
The different possibilities will be tried in sequence, and testing stops</br>
if one comparison returns a "not-equal".  For example, the default</br>
    '(time-up category-keep priority-down)</br>
means: Pull out all entries having a specified time of day and sort them,</br>
in order to make a time schedule for the current day the first thing in the</br>
agenda listing for the day.  Of the entries without a time indication, keep</br>
the grouped in categories, don't sort the categories, but keep them in</br>
the sequence given in `org-agenda-files'.  Within each category sort by</br>
priority.</br>
</br>
Leaving out `category-keep' would mean that items will be sorted across</br>
categories by priority.</br>
</br>
Instead of a single list, this can also be a set of list for specific</br>
contents, with a context symbol in the car of the list, any of</br>
`agenda', `todo', `tags', `search' for the corresponding agenda views.</br>
