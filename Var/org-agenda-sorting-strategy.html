Documentation:<br/>
Sorting structure for the agenda items of a single day.<br/>
This is a list of symbols which will be used in sequence to determine<br/>
if an entry should be listed before another entry.  The following<br/>
symbols are recognized:<br/>
<br/>
time-up            Put entries with time-of-day indications first, early first<br/>
time-down          Put entries with time-of-day indications first, late first<br/>
category-keep      Keep the default order of categories, corresponding to the<br/>
		   sequence in `org-agenda-files'.<br/>
category-up        Sort alphabetically by category, A-Z.<br/>
category-down      Sort alphabetically by category, Z-A.<br/>
tag-up             Sort alphabetically by last tag, A-Z.<br/>
tag-down           Sort alphabetically by last tag, Z-A.<br/>
priority-up        Sort numerically by priority, high priority last.<br/>
priority-down      Sort numerically by priority, high priority first.<br/>
todo-state-up      Sort by todo state, tasks that are done last.<br/>
todo-state-down    Sort by todo state, tasks that are done first.<br/>
effort-up          Sort numerically by estimated effort, high effort last.<br/>
effort-down        Sort numerically by estimated effort, high effort first.<br/>
user-defined-up    Sort according to `org-agenda-cmp-user-defined', high last.<br/>
user-defined-down  Sort according to `org-agenda-cmp-user-defined', high first.<br/>
habit-up           Put entries that are habits first<br/>
habit-down         Put entries that are habits last<br/>
alpha-up           Sort headlines alphabetically<br/>
alpha-down         Sort headlines alphabetically, reversed<br/>
<br/>
The different possibilities will be tried in sequence, and testing stops<br/>
if one comparison returns a "not-equal".  For example, the default<br/>
    '(time-up category-keep priority-down)<br/>
means: Pull out all entries having a specified time of day and sort them,<br/>
in order to make a time schedule for the current day the first thing in the<br/>
agenda listing for the day.  Of the entries without a time indication, keep<br/>
the grouped in categories, don't sort the categories, but keep them in<br/>
the sequence given in `org-agenda-files'.  Within each category sort by<br/>
priority.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving out `category-keep' would mean that items will be sorted across<br/>
categories by priority.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of a single list, this can also be a set of list for specific<br/>
contents, with a context symbol in the car of the list, any of<br/>
`agenda', `todo', `tags', `search' for the corresponding agenda views.<br/>
