Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means ignore some deadline TODO items when making TODO list.</br>
There are different motivations for using different values, please think</br>
carefully when configuring this variable.</br>
</br>
This applies when creating the global todo list.</br>
Valid values are:</br>
</br>
near    Don't show near deadline entries.  A deadline is near when it is</br>
        closer than `org-deadline-warning-days' days.  The idea behind this</br>
        is that such items will appear in the agenda anyway.</br>
</br>
far     Don't show TODO entries where a deadline has been defined, but</br>
        the deadline is not near.  This is useful if you don't want to</br>
        use the todo list to figure out what to do now.</br>
</br>
past    Don't show entries with a deadline timestamp for today or in the past.</br>
</br>
future  Don't show entries with a deadline timestamp in the future, not even</br>
        when they become `near' ones.  Use it with caution.</br>
</br>
all     Ignore all TODO entries that do have a deadline.</br>
</br>
t       Same as `near', for backward compatibility.</br>
</br>
This variable can also have an integer as a value.  See</br>
`org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp' for more details.</br>
</br>
See also `org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date'.</br>
See also the variable `org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options' if you want</br>
to make his option also apply to the tags-todo list.</br>
