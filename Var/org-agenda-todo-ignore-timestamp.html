<strong>org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means don't show entries with a timestamp.</br>
This applies when creating the global todo list.</br>
Valid values are:</br>
</br>
past     Don't show entries for today or in the past.</br>
</br>
future   Don't show entries with a timestamp in the future.</br>
         The idea behind this is that if it has a future</br>
         timestamp, you don't want to think about it until the</br>
         date.</br>
</br>
all      Don't show any entries with a timestamp in the global todo list.</br>
         The idea behind this is that by setting a timestamp, you</br>
         have already "taken care" of this item.</br>
</br>
This variable can also have an integer as a value.  If positive (N),</br>
todos with a timestamp N or more days in the future will be ignored.  If</br>
negative (-N), todos with a timestamp N or more days in the past will be</br>
ignored.  If 0, todos with a timestamp either today or in the future will</br>
be ignored.  For example, a value of -1 will exclude todos with a</br>
timestamp in the past (yesterday or earlier), while a value of 7 will</br>
exclude todos with a timestamp a week or more in the future.</br>

See also the variable `org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options' if you want</br>
to make his option also apply to the tags-todo list.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>
