<strong>org-archive-location</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"%s_archive::"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The location where subtrees should be archived.</br>
</br>
The value of this variable is a string, consisting of two parts,</br>
separated by a double-colon.  The first part is a filename and</br>
the second part is a headline.</br>
</br>
When the filename is omitted, archiving happens in the same file.</br>
%s in the filename will be replaced by the current file</br>
name (without the directory part).  Archiving to a different file</br>
is useful to keep archived entries from contributing to the</br>
Org-mode Agenda.</br>
</br>
The archived entries will be filed as subtrees of the specified</br>
headline.  When the headline is omitted, the subtrees are simply</br>
filed away at the end of the file, as top-level entries.  Also in</br>
the heading you can use %s to represent the file name, this can be</br>
useful when using the same archive for a number of different files.</br>
</br>
Here are a few examples:</br>
"%s_archive::"</br>
	If the current file is Projects.org, archive in file</br>
	Projects.org_archive, as top-level trees.  This is the default.</br>
</br>
"::* Archived Tasks"</br>
	Archive in the current file, under the top-level headline</br>
	"* Archived Tasks".</br>
</br>
"~/org/archive.org::"</br>
	Archive in file ~/org/archive.org (absolute path), as top-level trees.</br>
</br>
"~/org/archive.org::* From %s"</br>
	Archive in file ~/org/archive.org (absolute path), under headlines</br>
        "From FILENAME" where file name is the current file name.</br>
</br>
"~/org/datetree.org::datetree/* Finished Tasks"</br>
        The "datetree/" string is special, signifying to archive</br>
        items to the datetree.  Items are placed in either the CLOSED</br>
        date of the item, or the current date if there is no CLOSED date.</br>
        The heading will be a subentry to the current date.  There doesn't</br>
        need to be a heading, but there always needs to be a slash after</br>
        datetree.  For example, to store archived items directly in the</br>
        datetree, use "~/org/datetree.org::datetree/".</br>
</br>
"basement::** Finished Tasks"</br>
	Archive in file ./basement (relative path), as level 3 trees</br>
	below the level 2 heading "** Finished Tasks".</br>
</br>
You may set this option on a per-file basis by adding to the buffer a</br>
line like</br>
</br>
#+ARCHIVE: basement::** Finished Tasks</br>
</br>
You may also define it locally for a subtree by setting an ARCHIVE property</br>
in the entry.  If such a property is found in an entry, or anywhere up</br>
the hierarchy, it will be used.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
