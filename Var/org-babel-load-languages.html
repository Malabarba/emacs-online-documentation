Languages which can be evaluated in Org-mode buffers.</br>
This list can be used to load support for any of the languages</br>
below, note that each language will depend on a different set of</br>
system executables and/or Emacs modes.  When a language is</br>
"loaded", then code blocks in that language can be evaluated</br>
with `org-babel-execute-src-block' bound by default to C-c</br>
C-c (note the `org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c' variable can</br>
be set to remove code block evaluation from the C-c C-c</br>
keybinding.  By default only Emacs Lisp (which has no</br>
requirements) is loaded.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
