org-blank-before-new-entry is a variable defined in `org.el'.<br/>Its value is ((heading . auto) (plain-list-item . auto))<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Should `org-insert-heading' leave a blank line before new heading/item?<br/>The value is an alist, with `heading' and `plain-list-item' as CAR,<br/>and a boolean flag as CDR.  The cdr may also be the symbol `auto', in<br/>which case Org will look at the surrounding headings/items and try to<br/>make an intelligent decision whether to insert a blank line or not.<br/><br/>For plain lists, if the variable `org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists' is<br/>set, the setting here is ignored and no empty line is inserted, to avoid<br/>breaking the list structure.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
