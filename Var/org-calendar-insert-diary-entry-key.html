<strong>org-calendar-insert-diary-entry-key</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>[105]</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The key to be installed in `calendar-mode-map' for adding diary entries.</br>
This option is irrelevant until `org-agenda-diary-file' has been configured</br>
to point to an Org-mode file.  When that is the case, the command</br>
`org-agenda-diary-entry' will be bound to the key given here, by default</br>
`i'.  In the calendar, `i' normally adds entries to `diary-file'.  So</br>
if you want to continue doing this, you need to change this to a different</br>
key.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
