<strong>org-capture-current-plist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-capture.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Local variable holding the plist in a capture buffer.<br/>
This is used to store the plist for use when finishing a capture process<br/>
because another such process might have changed the global variable by then.<br/>
<br/>
Each time a new capture buffer has been set up, the global `org-capture-plist'<br/>
is copied to this variable, which is local in the indirect buffer.
