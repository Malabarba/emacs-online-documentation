Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Check if in invisible region before inserting or deleting a character.</br>
Valid values are:</br>
</br>
nil              Do not check, so just do invisible edits.</br>
error            Throw an error and do nothing.</br>
show             Make point visible, and do the requested edit.</br>
show-and-error   Make point visible, then throw an error and abort the edit.</br>
smart            Make point visible, and do insertion/deletion if it is</br>
                 adjacent to visible text and the change feels predictable.</br>
                 Never delete a previously invisible character or add in the</br>
                 middle or right after an invisible region.  Basically, this</br>
                 allows insertion and backward-delete right before ellipses.</br>
                 FIXME: maybe in this case we should not even show?</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
