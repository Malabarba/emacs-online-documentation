<strong>org-clock-out-when-done</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-clock.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, clock will be stopped when the clocked entry is marked DONE.</br>
DONE here means any DONE-like state.</br>
A nil value means clock will keep running until stopped explicitly with</br>
`C-c C-x C-o', or until the clock is started in a different item.</br>
Instead of t, this can also be a list of TODO states that should trigger</br>
clocking out.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
