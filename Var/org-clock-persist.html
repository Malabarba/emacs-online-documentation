<strong>org-clock-persist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-clock.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
When non-nil, save the running clock when Emacs is closed.<br/>
The clock is resumed when Emacs restarts.<br/>
When this is t, both the running clock, and the entire clock<br/>
history are saved.  When this is the symbol `clock', only the<br/>
running clock is saved.  When this is the symbol `history', only<br/>
the clock history is saved.<br/>
<br/>
When Emacs restarts with saved clock information, the file containing<br/>
the running clock as well as all files mentioned in the clock history<br/>
will be visited.<br/>
<br/>
All this depends on running `org-clock-persistence-insinuate' in your<br/>
Emacs initialization file.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
