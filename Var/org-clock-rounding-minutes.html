When set to a non-integer value, use the car of</br>
`org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes', like for setting a time-stamp.</br>

and you clock in: then the clock starts at 14:45.  If you clock</br>
out within the next 5 minutes, the clock line will be removed;</br>
if you clock out 8 minutes after your clocked in, the clock</br>
out time will be 14:50.</br>
