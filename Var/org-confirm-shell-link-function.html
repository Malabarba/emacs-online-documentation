Non-nil means ask for confirmation before executing shell links.</br>
Shell links can be dangerous: just think about a link</br>
</br>
     [[shell:rm -rf ~/*][Google Search]]</br>
</br>
This link would show up in your Org-mode document as "Google Search",</br>
but really it would remove your entire home directory.</br>
Therefore we advise against setting this variable to nil.</br>
Just change it to `y-or-n-p' if you want to confirm with a</br>
single keystroke rather than having to type "yes".</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
