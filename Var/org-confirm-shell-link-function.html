Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means ask for confirmation before executing shell links.<br/>
Shell links can be dangerous: just think about a link<br/>
<br/>
     [[shell:rm -rf ~/*][Google Search]]<br/>
<br/>
This link would show up in your Org-mode document as "Google Search",<br/>
but really it would remove your entire home directory.<br/>
Therefore we advise against setting this variable to nil.<br/>
Just change it to `y-or-n-p' if you want to confirm with a<br/>
single keystroke rather than having to type "yes".<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
