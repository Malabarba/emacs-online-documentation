Documentation:<br/>
List of functions to construct the right search string for a file link.<br/>
These functions are called in turn with point at the location to<br/>
which the link should point.<br/>
<br/>
A function in the hook should first test if it would like to<br/>
handle this file type, for example by checking the `major-mode'<br/>
or the file extension.  If it decides not to handle this file, it<br/>
should just return nil to give other functions a chance.  If it<br/>
does handle the file, it must return the search string to be used<br/>
when following the link.  The search string will be part of the<br/>
file link, given after a double colon, and `org-open-at-point'<br/>
will automatically search for it.  If special measures must be<br/>
taken to make the search successful, another function should be<br/>
added to the companion hook `org-execute-file-search-functions',<br/>
which see.<br/>
<br/>
A function in this hook may also use `setq' to set the variable<br/>
`description' to provide a suggestion for the descriptive text to<br/>
be used for this link when it gets inserted into an Org-mode<br/>
buffer with M-x org-insert-link.
