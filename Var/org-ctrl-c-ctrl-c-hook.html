Hook for functions attaching themselves to `C-c C-c'.</br>
</br>
This can be used to add additional functionality to the C-c C-c</br>
key which executes context-dependent commands.  This hook is run</br>
before any other test, while `org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-final-hook' is</br>
run after the last test.</br>
</br>
Each function will be called with no arguments.  The function</br>
must check if the context is appropriate for it to act.  If yes,</br>
it should do its thing and then return a non-nil value.  If the</br>
context is wrong, just do nothing and return nil.
