<strong>org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, do not delete a hidden subtree with C-k.</br>
When set to the symbol `error', simply throw an error when C-k is</br>
used to kill (part-of) a headline that has hidden text behind it.</br>
Any other non-nil value will result in a query to the user, if it is</br>
OK to kill that hidden subtree.  When nil, kill without remorse.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
