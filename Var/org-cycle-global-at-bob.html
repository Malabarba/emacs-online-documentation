<strong>org-cycle-global-at-bob</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Cycle globally if cursor is at beginning of buffer and not at a headline.</br>
This makes it possible to do global cycling without having to use S-TAB or</br>
C-u TAB.  For this special case to work, the first line</br>
of the buffer must not be a headline -- it may be empty or some other text.</br>
When used in this way, `org-cycle-hook' is disabled temporarily to make</br>
sure the cursor stays at the beginning of the buffer.  When this option is</br>
nil, don't do anything special at the beginning of the buffer.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
