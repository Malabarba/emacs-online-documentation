org-cycle-global-at-bob is a variable defined in `org.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Cycle globally if cursor is at beginning of buffer and not at a headline.<br/>This makes it possible to do global cycling without having to use S-TAB or<br/>C-u TAB.  For this special case to work, the first line<br/>of the buffer must not be a headline -- it may be empty or some other text.<br/>When used in this way, `org-cycle-hook' is disabled temporarily to make<br/>sure the cursor stays at the beginning of the buffer.  When this option is<br/>nil, don't do anything special at the beginning of the buffer.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
