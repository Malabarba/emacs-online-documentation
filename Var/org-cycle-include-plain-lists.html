<strong>org-cycle-include-plain-lists</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-list.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>

When t, make TAB cycle visibility on plain list items.</br>
Cycling plain lists works only when the cursor is on a plain list</br>
item.  When the cursor is on an outline heading, plain lists are</br>
treated as text.  This is the most stable way of handling this,</br>
which is why it is the default.</br>
</br>
When this is the symbol `integrate', then integrate plain list</br>
items when cycling, as if they were children of outline headings.</br>
</br>
This setting can lead to strange effects when switching visibility</br>
to `children', because the first "child" in a subtree decides</br>
what children should be listed.  If that first "child" is a</br>
plain list item with an implied large level number, all true</br>
children and grand children of the outline heading will be</br>
exposed in a children' view.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
