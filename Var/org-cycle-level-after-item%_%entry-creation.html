<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means cycle entry level or item indentation in new empty entries.</br>
</br>
When the cursor is at the end of an empty headline, i.e., with only stars</br>
and maybe a TODO keyword, TAB will then switch the entry to become a child,</br>
and then all possible ancestor states, before returning to the original state.</br>
This makes data entry extremely fast:  M-RET to create a new headline,</br>
on TAB to make it a child, two or more tabs to make it a (grand-)uncle.</br>
</br>
When the cursor is at the end of an empty plain list item, one TAB will</br>
make it a subitem, two or more tabs will back up to make this an item</br>
higher up in the item hierarchy.</br>

You can customize this variable.
