<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Number of empty lines needed to keep an empty line between collapsed trees.</br>
If you leave an empty line between the end of a subtree and the following</br>
headline, this empty line is hidden when the subtree is folded.</br>
Org-mode will leave (exactly) one empty line visible if the number of</br>
empty lines is equal or larger to the number given in this variable.</br>
So the default 2 means at least 2 empty lines after the end of a subtree</br>
are needed to produce free space between a collapsed subtree and the</br>
following headline.</br>
</br>
If the number is negative, and the number of empty lines is at least -N,</br>
all empty lines are shown.</br>
</br>
Special case: when 0, never leave empty lines in collapsed view.</br>

You can customize this variable.
