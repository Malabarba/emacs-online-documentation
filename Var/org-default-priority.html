<strong>org-default-priority</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>66</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The default priority of TODO items.</br>
This is the priority an item gets if no explicit priority is given.</br>
When starting to cycle on an empty priority the first step in the cycle</br>
depends on `org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'.  The resulting first</br>
step priority must not exceed the range from `org-highest-priority' to</br>
`org-lowest-priority' which means that `org-default-priority' has to be</br>
in this range exclusive or inclusive the range boundaries.  Else the</br>
first step refuses to set the default and the second will fall back</br>
to (depending on the command used) the highest or lowest priority.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
