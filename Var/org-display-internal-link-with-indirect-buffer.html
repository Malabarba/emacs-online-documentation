Non-nil means use indirect buffer to display infile links.</br>
Activating internal links (from one location in a file to another location</br>
in the same file) normally just jumps to the location.  When the link is</br>
activated with a C-u prefix (or with mouse-3), the link is displayed in</br>
another window.  When this option is set, the other window actually displays</br>
an indirect buffer clone of the current buffer, to avoid any visibility</br>
changes to the current buffer.</br>

You can customize this variable.
