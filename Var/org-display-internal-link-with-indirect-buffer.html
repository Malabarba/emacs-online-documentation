org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer is a variable defined in `org.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means use indirect buffer to display infile links.<br/>Activating internal links (from one location in a file to another location<br/>in the same file) normally just jumps to the location.  When the link is<br/>activated with a C-u prefix (or with mouse-3), the link is displayed in<br/>another window.  When this option is set, the other window actually displays<br/>an indirect buffer clone of the current buffer, to avoid any visibility<br/>changes to the current buffer.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
