<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means turn `auto-save-mode' on when editing a source block.</br>
This will save the content of the source code editing buffer into</br>
a newly created file, not the base buffer for this source block.</br>
</br>
If you want to regularly save the base buffer instead of the source</br>
code editing buffer, see `org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay' instead.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
