<strong>org-enable-table-editor</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>optimized</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means lines starting with "|" are handled by the table editor.</br>
When nil, such lines will be treated like ordinary lines.</br>
</br>
When equal to the symbol `optimized', the table editor will be optimized to</br>
do the following:</br>
- Automatic overwrite mode in front of whitespace in table fields.</br>
  This makes the structure of the table stay in tact as long as the edited</br>
  field does not exceed the column width.</br>
- Minimize the number of realigns.  Normally, the table is aligned each time</br>
  TAB or RET are pressed to move to another field.  With optimization this</br>
  happens only if changes to a field might have changed the column width.</br>
Optimization requires replacing the functions `self-insert-command',</br>
`delete-char', and `backward-delete-char' in Org-mode buffers, with a</br>
slight (in fact: unnoticeable) speed impact for normal typing.  Org-mode is</br>
very good at guessing when a re-align will be necessary, but you can always</br>
force one with M-x org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c.</br>
</br>
If you would like to use the optimized version in Org-mode, but the</br>
un-optimized version in OrgTbl-mode, see the variable `orgtbl-optimized'.</br>
</br>
This variable can be used to turn on and off the table editor during a session,</br>
but in order to toggle optimization, a restart is required.</br>
</br>
See also the variable `org-table-auto-blank-field'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
