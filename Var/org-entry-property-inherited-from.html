<strong>org-entry-property-inherited-from</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is #<marker in no buffer><br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Marker pointing to the entry from where a property was inherited.<br/>
Each call to `org-entry-get-with-inheritance' will set this marker to the<br/>
location of the entry where the inheritance search matched.  If there was<br/>
no match, the marker will point nowhere.<br/>
Note that also `org-entry-get' calls this function, if the INHERIT flag<br/>
is set.
