List of functions to execute a file search triggered by a link.</br>
</br>
Functions added to this hook must accept a single argument, the</br>
search string that was part of the file link, the part after the</br>
double colon.  The function must first check if it would like to</br>
handle this search, for example by checking the `major-mode' or</br>
the file extension.  If it decides not to handle this search, it</br>
should just return nil to give other functions a chance.  If it</br>
does handle the search, it must return a non-nil value to keep</br>
other functions from trying.</br>
</br>
Each function can access the current prefix argument through the</br>
variable `current-prefix-arg'.  Note that a single prefix is used</br>
to force opening a link in Emacs, so it may be good to only use a</br>
numeric or double prefix to guide the search function.</br>
</br>
In case this is needed, a function in this hook can also restore</br>
the window configuration before `org-open-at-point' was called using:</br>
