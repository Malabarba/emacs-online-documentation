Hook run before parsing an export buffer.</br>
</br>
This is run after include keywords and macros have been expanded</br>
and Babel code blocks executed, on a copy of the original buffer</br>
being exported.  Visibility and narrowing are preserved.  Point</br>
is at the beginning of the buffer.</br>
</br>
Every function in this hook will be called with one argument: the</br>
back-end currently used, as a symbol.
