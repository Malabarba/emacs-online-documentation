<strong>org-export-current-backend</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-exp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
During export, this will be bound to a symbol such as 'html,<br/>
  'latex, 'docbook, 'ascii, etc, indicating which of the export<br/>
  backends is in use.  Otherwise it has the value nil.  Users<br/>
  should not attempt to change the value of this variable<br/>
  directly, but it can be used in code to test whether export is<br/>
  in progress, and if so, what the backend is.
