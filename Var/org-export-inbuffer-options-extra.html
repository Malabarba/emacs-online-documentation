<strong>org-export-inbuffer-options-extra</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-exp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of additional in-buffer options that should be detected.<br/>
Just before export, the buffer is scanned for options like #+TITLE, #+EMAIL,<br/>
etc.  Extensions can add to this list to get their options detected, and they<br/>
can then add a function to `org-export-options-filters' to process these<br/>
options.<br/>
Each element in this list must be a list, with the in-buffer keyword as car,<br/>
and a property (a symbol) as the next element.  All occurrences of the<br/>
keyword will be found, the values concatenated with a space character<br/>
in between, and the result stored in the export options property list.
