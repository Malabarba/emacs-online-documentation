<strong>This variable no longer exists in emacs 24.4</strong></br></br>
<strong>org-export-latex-default-packages-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is shown below.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist of default packages to be inserted in the header.<br/>
Change this only if one of the packages here causes an incompatibility<br/>
with another package you are using.<br/>
The packages in this list are needed by one part or another of Org-mode<br/>
to function properly.<br/>
<br/>
- inputenc, fontenc:  for basic font and character selection<br/>
- textcomp, marvosymb, wasysym, latexsym, amssym: for various symbols used<br/>
  for interpreting the entities in `org-entities'.  You can skip some of these<br/>
  packages if you don't use any of the symbols in it.<br/>
- graphicx: for including images<br/>
- float, wrapfig: for figure placement<br/>
- longtable: for long tables<br/>
- hyperref: for cross references<br/>
<br/>
Therefore you should not modify this variable unless you know what you<br/>
are doing.  The one reason to change it anyway is that you might be loading<br/>
some other package that conflicts with one of the default packages.<br/>
Each cell is of the format ( "options" "package" snippet-flag).<br/>
If SNIPPET-FLAG is t, the package also needs to be included when<br/>
compiling LaTeX snippets into images for inclusion into HTML.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
