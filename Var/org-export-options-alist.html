Alist between export properties and ways to set them.</br>
</br>
The CAR of the alist is the property name, and the CDR is a list</br>
like (KEYWORD OPTION DEFAULT BEHAVIOR) where:</br>
</br>
KEYWORD is a string representing a buffer keyword, or nil.  Each</br>
  property defined this way can also be set, during subtree</br>
  export, through a headline property named after the keyword</br>
  with the "EXPORT_" prefix (i.e. DATE keyword and EXPORT_DATE</br>
  property).</br>
OPTION is a string that could be found in an #+OPTIONS: line.</br>
DEFAULT is the default value for the property.</br>
BEHAVIOR determines how Org should handle multiple keywords for</br>
  the same property.  It is a symbol among:</br>
  nil       Keep old value and discard the new one.</br>
  t         Replace old value with the new one.</br>
  `space'   Concatenate the values, separating them with a space.</br>
  `newline' Concatenate the values, separating them with</br>
	    a newline.</br>
  `split'   Split values at white spaces, and cons them to the</br>
	    previous list.</br>
</br>
Values set through KEYWORD and OPTION have precedence over</br>
DEFAULT.</br>
</br>
All these properties should be back-end agnostic.  Back-end</br>
specific properties are set through `org-export-define-backend'.</br>
Properties redefined there have precedence over these.</br>
