<strong>org-export-run-in-background</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-exp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means export and publishing commands will run in background.<br/>
This works by starting up a separate Emacs process visiting the same file<br/>
and doing the export from there.<br/>
Not all export commands are affected by this - only the ones which<br/>
actually write to a file, and that do not depend on the buffer state.<br/>
<br/>
If this option is nil, you can still get background export by calling<br/>
`org-export' with a double prefix arg: C-u C-u C-c C-e.<br/>
<br/>
If this option is t, the double prefix can be used to exceptionally<br/>
force an export command into the current process.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
