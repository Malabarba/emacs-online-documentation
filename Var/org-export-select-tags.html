Tags that select a tree for export.</br>
</br>
If any such tag is found in a buffer, all trees that do not carry</br>
one of these tags will be ignored during export.  Inside trees</br>
that are selected like this, you can still deselect a subtree by</br>
tagging it with one of the `org-export-exclude-tags'.</br>
</br>
This option can also be set with the SELECT_TAGS keyword.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
