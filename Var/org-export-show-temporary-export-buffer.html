Non-nil means show buffer after exporting to temp buffer.</br>
When Org exports to a file, the buffer visiting that file is ever</br>
shown, but remains buried.  However, when exporting to</br>
a temporary buffer, that buffer is popped up in a second window.</br>
When this variable is nil, the buffer remains buried also in</br>
these cases.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
