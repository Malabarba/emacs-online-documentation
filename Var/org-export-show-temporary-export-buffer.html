Non-nil means show buffer after exporting to temp buffer.<br/>
When Org exports to a file, the buffer visiting that file is ever<br/>
shown, but remains buried.  However, when exporting to a temporary<br/>
buffer, that buffer is popped up in a second window.  When this variable<br/>
is nil, the buffer remains buried also in these cases.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
