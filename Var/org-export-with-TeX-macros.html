Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means interpret simple TeX-like macros when exporting.<br/>
For example, HTML export converts \alpha to &alpha; and \AA to &Aring;.<br/>
Not only real TeX macros will work here, but the standard HTML entities<br/>
for math can be used as macro names as well.  For a list of supported<br/>
names in HTML export, see the constant `org-entities' and the user option<br/>
`org-entities-user'.<br/>
Not all export backends support this.<br/>
<br/>
This option can also be set with the +OPTIONS line, e.g. "TeX:nil".<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
