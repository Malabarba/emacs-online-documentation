<strong>org-export-with-smart-quotes</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ox.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means activate smart quotes during export.</br>
This option can also be set with the OPTIONS keyword,</br>
e.g., "':t".</br>
</br>
When setting this to non-nil, you need to take care of</br>
using the correct Babel package when exporting to LaTeX.</br>
E.g., you can load Babel for french like this:</br>
</br>
#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[french]{babel}</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
