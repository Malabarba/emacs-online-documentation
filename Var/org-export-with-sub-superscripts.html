<strong>org-export-with-sub-superscripts</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
  This variable is an alias for `org-use-sub-superscripts'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means interpret "_" and "^" for export.<br/>
When this option is turned on, you can use TeX-like syntax for sub- and<br/>
superscripts.  Several characters after "_" or "^" will be<br/>
considered as a single item - so grouping with {} is normally not<br/>
needed.  For example, the following things will be parsed as single<br/>
sub- or superscripts.<br/>
<br/>
 10^24   or   10^tau     several digits will be considered 1 item.<br/>
 10^-12  or   10^-tau    a leading sign with digits or a word<br/>
 x^2-y^3                 will be read as x^2 - y^3, because items are<br/>
			 terminated by almost any nonword/nondigit char.<br/>
 x_{i^2} or   x^(2-i)    braces or parenthesis do grouping.<br/>
<br/>
Still, ambiguity is possible - so when in doubt use {} to enclose the<br/>
sub/superscript.  If you set this variable to the symbol `{}',<br/>
the braces are *required* in order to trigger interpretations as<br/>
sub/superscript.  This can be helpful in documents that need "_"<br/>
frequently in plain text.<br/>
<br/>
Not all export backends support this, but HTML does.<br/>
<br/>
This option can also be set with the #+OPTIONS line, e.g. "^:nil".<br/>

You can customize this variable.
