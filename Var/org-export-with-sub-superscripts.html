<strong>org-export-with-sub-superscripts</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ox.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means interpret "_" and "^" for export.</br>
</br>
If you want to control how Org displays those characters, see</br>
`org-use-sub-superscripts'.  `org-export-with-sub-superscripts'</br>
used to be an alias for `org-use-sub-superscripts' in Org <8.0,</br>
it is not anymore.</br>
</br>
When this option is turned on, you can use TeX-like syntax for</br>
sub- and superscripts and see them exported correctly.</br>
</br>
You can also set the option with #+OPTIONS: ^:t</br>
</br>
Several characters after "_" or "^" will be considered as a</br>
single item - so grouping with {} is normally not needed.  For</br>
example, the following things will be parsed as single sub- or</br>
superscripts:</br>
</br>
 10^24   or   10^tau     several digits will be considered 1 item.</br>
 10^-12  or   10^-tau    a leading sign with digits or a word</br>
 x^2-y^3                 will be read as x^2 - y^3, because items are</br>
			 terminated by almost any nonword/nondigit char.</br>
 x_{i^2} or   x^(2-i)    braces or parenthesis do grouping.</br>
</br>
Still, ambiguity is possible.  So when in doubt, use {} to enclose</br>
the sub/superscript.  If you set this variable to the symbol `{}',</br>
the braces are *required* in order to trigger interpretations as</br>
sub/superscript.  This can be helpful in documents that need "_"</br>
frequently in plain text.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
