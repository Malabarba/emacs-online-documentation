Its value is <pre>0</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The hour when your day really ends.  Must be an integer.</br>
This has influence for the following applications:</br>
- When switching the agenda to "today".  It it is still earlier than</br>
  the time given here, the day recognized as TODAY is actually yesterday.</br>
- When a date is read from the user and it is still before the time given</br>
  here, the current date and time will be assumed to be yesterday, 23:59.</br>
  Also, timestamps inserted in capture templates follow this rule.</br>
</br>
IMPORTANT:  This is a feature whose implementation is and likely will</br>
remain incomplete.  Really, it is only here because past midnight seems to</br>
be the favorite working time of John Wiegley :-)</br>
