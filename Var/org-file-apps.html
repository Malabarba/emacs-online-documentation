External applications for opening `file:path' items in a document.</br>
Org-mode uses system defaults for different file types, but</br>
you can use this variable to set the application for a given file</br>
extension.  The entries in this list are cons cells where the car identifies</br>
files and the cdr the corresponding command.  Possible values for the</br>
file identifier are</br>
 "string"    A string as a file identifier can be interpreted in different</br>
               ways, depending on its contents:</br>
</br>
               - Alphanumeric characters only:</br>
                 Match links with this file extension.</br>
                 Example: ("pdf" . "evince %s")</br>
                          to open PDFs with evince.</br>
</br>
               - Regular expression: Match links where the</br>
                 filename matches the regexp.  If you want to</br>
                 use groups here, use shy groups.</br>
</br>
                 Example: ("\.x?html\'" . "firefox %s")</br>
                          ("\(?:xhtml\|html\)" . "firefox %s")</br>
                          to open *.html and *.xhtml with firefox.</br>
</br>
               - Regular expression which contains (non-shy) groups:</br>
                 Match links where the whole link, including "::", and</br>
                 anything after that, matches the regexp.</br>
                 In a custom command string, %1, %2, etc. are replaced with</br>
                 the parts of the link that were matched by the groups.</br>
                 For backwards compatibility, if a command string is given</br>
                 that does not use any of the group matches, this case is</br>
                 handled identically to the second one (i.e. match against</br>
                 file name only).</br>
                 In a custom lisp form, you can access the group matches with</br>
                 (match-string n link).</br>
</br>
                 Example: ("\.pdf::\(\d+\)\'" . "evince -p %1 %s")</br>
                     to open [[file:document.pdf::5]] with evince at page 5.</br>
</br>
 `directory'   Matches a directory</br>
 `remote'      Matches a remote file, accessible through tramp or efs.</br>
               Remote files most likely should be visited through Emacs</br>
               because external applications cannot handle such paths.</br>
`auto-mode'    Matches files that are matched by any entry in `auto-mode-alist',</br>
               so all files Emacs knows how to handle.  Using this with</br>
               command `emacs' will open most files in Emacs.  Beware that this</br>
               will also open html files inside Emacs, unless you add</br>
               ("html" . default) to the list as well.</br>
 t             Default for files not matched by any of the other options.</br>
 `system'      The system command to open files, like `open' on Windows</br>
               and Mac OS X, and mailcap under GNU/Linux.  This is the command</br>
               that will be selected if you call `C-c C-o' with a double</br>
               C-u C-u prefix.</br>
</br>
Possible values for the command are:</br>
 `emacs'       The file will be visited by the current Emacs process.</br>
 `default'     Use the default application for this file type, which is the</br>
               association for t in the list, most likely in the system-specific</br>
               part.</br>
               This can be used to overrule an unwanted setting in the</br>
               system-specific variable.</br>
 `system'      Use the system command for opening files, like "open".</br>
               This command is specified by the entry whose car is `system'.</br>
               Most likely, the system-specific version of this variable</br>
               does define this command, but you can overrule/replace it</br>
               here.</br>
 string        A command to be executed by a shell; %s will be replaced</br>
               by the path to the file.</br>
 sexp          A Lisp form which will be evaluated.  The file path will</br>
               be available in the Lisp variable `file'.</br>

`org-file-apps-defaults-macosx'</br>

You can customize this variable.
