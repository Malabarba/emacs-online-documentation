Its value is "Footnotes"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Outline heading containing footnote definitions before export.<br/>
This can be nil, to place footnotes locally at the end of the current<br/>
outline node.  If can also be the name of a special outline heading<br/>
under which footnotes should be put.<br/>
This variable defines the place where Org puts the definition<br/>
automatically, i.e. when creating the footnote, and when sorting the notes.<br/>
However, by hand you may place definitions *anywhere*.<br/>
If this is a string, during export, all subtrees starting with this<br/>
heading will be removed after extracting footnote definitions.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
