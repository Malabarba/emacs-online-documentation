<strong>org-footnote-tag-for-non-org-mode-files</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-footnote.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"Footnotes:"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Tag marking the beginning of footnote section.</br>
The Org footnote engine can be used in arbitrary text files as well</br>
as in Org-mode.  Outside Org mode, new footnotes are always placed at</br>
the end of the file.  When you normalize the notes, any line containing</br>
only this tag will be removed, a new one will be inserted at the end</br>
of the file, followed by the collected and normalized footnotes.</br>
</br>
If you don't want any tag in such buffers, set this variable to nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
