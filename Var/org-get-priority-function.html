Function to extract the priority from a string.</br>
The string is normally the headline.  If this is nil Org computes the</br>
priority from the priority cookie like [#A] in the headline.  It returns</br>
an integer, increasing by 1000 for each priority level.</br>
The user can set a different function here, which should take a string</br>
as an argument and return the numeric priority.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
