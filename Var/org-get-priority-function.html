Documentation:<br/>
Function to extract the priority from a string.<br/>
The string is normally the headline.  If this is nil Org computes the<br/>
priority from the priority cookie like [#A] in the headline.  It returns<br/>
an integer, increasing by 1000 for each priority level.<br/>
The user can set a different function here, which should take a string<br/>
as an argument and return the numeric priority.<br/>

You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
