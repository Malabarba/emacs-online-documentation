Non-nil means TODO statistics covers just direct children.</br>
When nil, all entries in the subtree are considered.</br>
This has only an effect if `org-provide-todo-statistics' is set.</br>
To set this to nil for only a single subtree, use a COOKIE_DATA</br>
property and include the word "recursive" into the value.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
