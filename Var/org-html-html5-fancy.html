</br>
For compatibility with Internet Explorer, it's probably a good</br>
idea to download some form of the html5shiv (for instance</br>
https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) and add it to your</br>
HTML_HEAD_EXTRA, so that your pages don't break for users of IE</br>
versions 8 and below.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
