<strong>org-html-link-org-files-as-html</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ox-html.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means make file links to `file.org' point to `file.html'.</br>
When `org-mode' is exporting an `org-mode' file to HTML, links to</br>
non-html files are directly put into a href tag in HTML.</br>
However, links to other Org-mode files (recognized by the</br>
extension `.org.) should become links to the corresponding html</br>
file, assuming that the linked `org-mode' file will also be</br>
converted to HTML.</br>
When nil, the links still point to the plain `.org' file.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
