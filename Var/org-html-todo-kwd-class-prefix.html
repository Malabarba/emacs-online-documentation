Prefix to class names for TODO keywords.</br>
Each TODO keyword gets a class given by the keyword itself, with this prefix.</br>
The default prefix is empty because it is nice to just use the keyword</br>
as a class name.  But if you get into conflicts with other, existing</br>
CSS classes, then this prefix can be very useful.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
