<strong>org-html-toplevel-hlevel</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ox-html.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>2</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The <H> level for level 1 headings in HTML export.</br>
This is also important for the classes that will be wrapped around headlines</br>
and outline structure.  If this variable is 1, the top-level headlines will</br>
be <h1>, and the corresponding classes will be outline-1, section-number-1,</br>
and outline-text-1.  If this is 2, all of these will get a 2 instead.</br>
The default for this variable is 2, because we use <h1> for formatting the</br>
document title.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
