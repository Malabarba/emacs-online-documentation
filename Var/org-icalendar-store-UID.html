<strong>org-icalendar-store-UID</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ox-icalendar.el</code>'.</br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means store any created UIDs in properties.</br>
</br>
The iCalendar standard requires that all entries have a unique identifier.</br>
Org will create these identifiers as needed.  When this variable is non-nil,</br>
the created UIDs will be stored in the ID property of the entry.  Then the</br>
next time this entry is exported, it will be exported with the same UID,</br>
superseding the previous form of it.  This is essential for</br>
synchronization services.</br>
</br>
This variable is not turned on by default because we want to avoid creating</br>
a property drawer in every entry if people are only playing with this feature,</br>
or if they are only using it locally.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
