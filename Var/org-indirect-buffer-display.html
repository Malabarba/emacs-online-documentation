How should indirect tree buffers be displayed?<br/>
This applies to indirect buffers created with the commands<br/>
M-x org-tree-to-indirect-buffer and M-x org-agenda-tree-to-indirect-buffer.<br/>
Valid values are:<br/>
current-window   Display in the current window<br/>
other-window     Just display in another window.<br/>
