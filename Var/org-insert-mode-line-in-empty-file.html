<strong>org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means insert the first line setting Org-mode in empty files.</br>
When the function `org-mode' is called interactively in an empty file, this</br>
normally means that the file name does not automatically trigger Org-mode.</br>
To ensure that the file will always be in Org-mode in the future, a</br>
line enforcing Org-mode will be inserted into the buffer, if this option</br>
has been set.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
