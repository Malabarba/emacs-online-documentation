<strong>org-latex-default-packages-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is shown <a href="#value">below</a>.</br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Alist of default packages to be inserted in the header.</br>
</br>
Change this only if one of the packages here causes an</br>
incompatibility with another package you are using.</br>
</br>
The packages in this list are needed by one part or another of</br>
Org mode to function properly:</br>
</br>
- inputenc, fontenc:  for basic font and character selection</br>
- fixltx2e: Important patches of LaTeX itself</br>
- graphicx: for including images</br>
- longtable: For multipage tables</br>
- float, wrapfig: for figure placement</br>
- rotating: for sideways figures and tables</br>
- ulem: for underline and strike-through</br>
- amsmath: for subscript and superscript and math environments</br>
- textcomp, marvosymb, wasysym, amssymb: for various symbols used</br>
  for interpreting the entities in `org-entities'.  You can skip</br>
  some of these packages if you don't use any of their symbols.</br>
- hyperref: for cross references</br>
</br>
Therefore you should not modify this variable unless you know</br>
what you are doing.  The one reason to change it anyway is that</br>
you might be loading some other package that conflicts with one</br>
of the default packages.  Each cell is of the format</br>
( "options" "package" snippet-flag).  If SNIPPET-FLAG is t,</br>
the package also needs to be included when compiling LaTeX</br>
snippets into images for inclusion into non-LaTeX output.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
