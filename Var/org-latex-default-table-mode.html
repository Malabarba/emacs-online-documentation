</br>
  `table' Regular LaTeX table.</br>
</br>
  `math' In this mode, every cell is considered as being in math</br>
     mode and the complete table will be wrapped within a math</br>
     environment.  It is particularly useful to write matrices.</br>
</br>
  `inline-math' This mode is almost the same as `math', but the</br>
     math environment will be inlined.</br>
</br>
  `verbatim' The table is exported as it appears in the Org</br>
     buffer, within a verbatim environment.</br>
</br>
This value can be overridden locally with, i.e. ":mode math" in</br>
LaTeX attributes.</br>
