Rules characterizing image files that can be inlined into LaTeX.</br>
</br>
A rule consists in an association whose key is the type of link</br>
to consider, and value is a regexp that will be matched against</br>
link's path.</br>
</br>
Note that, by default, the image extension *actually* allowed</br>
depend on the way the LaTeX file is processed.  When used with</br>
pdflatex, pdf, jpg and png images are OK.  When processing</br>
through dvi to Postscript, only ps and eps are allowed.  The</br>
default we use here encompasses both.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
