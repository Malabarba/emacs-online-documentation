Alist mapping languages to their minted language counterpart.</br>
The key is a symbol, the major mode symbol without the "-mode".</br>
The value is the string that should be inserted as the language</br>
parameter for the minted package.  If the mode name and the</br>
listings name are the same, the language does not need an entry</br>
in this list - but it does not hurt if it is present.</br>
</br>
Note that minted uses all lower case for language identifiers,</br>
and that the full list of language identifiers can be obtained</br>
with:</br>
</br>
  pygmentize -L lexers</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
