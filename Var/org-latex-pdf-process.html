Commands to process a LaTeX file to a PDF file.</br>
This is a list of strings, each of them will be given to the</br>
shell as a command.  %f in the command will be replaced by the</br>
full file name, %b by the file base name (i.e. without directory</br>
and extension parts) and %o by the base directory of the file.</br>
</br>
The reason why this is a list is that it usually takes several</br>
runs of `pdflatex', maybe mixed with a call to `bibtex'.  Org</br>
does not have a clever mechanism to detect which of these</br>
commands have to be run to get to a stable result, and it also</br>
does not do any error checking.</br>
</br>
By default, Org uses 3 runs of `pdflatex' to do the processing.</br>
If you have texi2dvi on your system and if that does not cause</br>
the infamous egrep/locale bug:</br>
</br>
     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2010-03/msg00031.html</br>
</br>
then `texi2dvi' is the superior choice as it automates the LaTeX</br>
build process by calling the "correct" combinations of</br>
auxiliary programs.  Org does offer `texi2dvi' as one of the</br>
customize options.  Alternatively, `rubber' and `latexmk' also</br>
provide similar functionality.  The latter supports `biber' out</br>
of the box.</br>
</br>
Alternatively, this may be a Lisp function that does the</br>
processing, so you could use this to apply the machinery of</br>
AUCTeX or the Emacs LaTeX mode.  This function should accept the</br>
file name as its single argument.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
