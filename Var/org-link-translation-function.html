Function to translate links with different syntax to Org syntax.</br>
This can be used to translate links created for example by the Planner</br>
or emacs-wiki packages to Org syntax.</br>
The function must accept two parameters, a TYPE containing the link</br>
protocol name like "rmail" or "gnus" as a string, and the linked path,</br>
which is everything after the link protocol.  It should return a cons</br>
with possibly modified values of type and path.</br>
Org contains a function for this, so if you set this variable to</br>
`org-translate-link-from-planner', you should be able follow many</br>
links created by planner.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
