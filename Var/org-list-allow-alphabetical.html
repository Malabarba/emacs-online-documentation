</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means single character alphabetical bullets are allowed.</br>
</br>
Both uppercase and lowercase are handled.  Lists with more than</br>
26 items will fallback to standard numbering.  Alphabetical</br>
counters like "[@c]" will be recognized.</br>
</br>
This variable needs to be set before org.el is loaded.  If you</br>
need to make a change while Emacs is running, use the customize</br>
interface or run the following code after updating it:</br>
</br>
  (when (featurep 'org-element) (load "org-element" t t))</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
