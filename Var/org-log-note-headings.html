<strong>org-log-note-headings</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is shown below.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Headings for notes added to entries.<br/>
The value is an alist, with the car being a symbol indicating the note<br/>
context, and the cdr is the heading to be used.  The heading may also be the<br/>
empty string.<br/>
%t in the heading will be replaced by a time stamp.<br/>
%T will be an active time stamp instead the default inactive one<br/>
%d will be replaced by a short-format time stamp.<br/>
%D will be replaced by an active short-format time stamp.<br/>
%s will be replaced by the new TODO state, in double quotes.<br/>
%S will be replaced by the old TODO state, in double quotes.<br/>
%u will be replaced by the user name.<br/>
%U will be replaced by the full user name.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it is not a good idea to change the `state' entry, because<br/>
agenda log mode depends on the format of these entries.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
