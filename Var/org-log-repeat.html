<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means record moving through the DONE state when triggering repeat.</br>
An auto-repeating task is immediately switched back to TODO when</br>
marked DONE.  If you are not logging state changes (by adding "@"</br>
or "!" to the TODO keyword definition), or set `org-log-done' to</br>
record a closing note, there will be no record of the task moving</br>
through DONE.  This variable forces taking a note anyway.</br>
</br>
nil     Don't force a record</br>
time    Record a time stamp</br>
note    Prompt for a note and add it with template `org-log-note-headings'</br>
</br>
This option can also be set with on a per-file-basis with</br>
</br>
   #+STARTUP: nologrepeat</br>
   #+STARTUP: logrepeat</br>
   #+STARTUP: lognoterepeat</br>
</br>
You can have local logging settings for a subtree by setting the LOGGING</br>
property to one or more of these keywords.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
