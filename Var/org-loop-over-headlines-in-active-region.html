Shall some commands act upon headlines in the active region?</br>
</br>
When set to `t', some commands will be performed in all headlines</br>
within the active region.</br>
</br>
When set to `start-level', some commands will be performed in all</br>
headlines within the active region, provided that these headlines</br>
are of the same level than the first one.</br>
</br>
When set to a string, those commands will be performed on the</br>
matching headlines within the active region.  Such string must be</br>
a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda tags view.</br>
</br>
The list of commands is: `org-schedule', `org-deadline',</br>
`org-todo', `org-archive-subtree', `org-archive-set-tag' and</br>
`org-archive-to-archive-sibling'.  The archiving commands skip</br>
already archived entries.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
