Modules that should always be loaded together with org.el.</br>
</br>
If a description starts with <C>, the file is not part of Emacs</br>
and loading it will require that you have downloaded and properly</br>
installed the Org mode distribution.</br>
</br>
You can also use this system to load external packages (i.e. neither Org</br>
core modules, nor modules from the CONTRIB directory).  Just add symbols</br>
to the end of the list.  If the package is called org-xyz.el, then you need</br>
to add the symbol `xyz', and the package must have a call to:</br>
</br>
   (provide 'org-xyz)</br>
</br>
For export specific modules, see also `org-export-backends'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
