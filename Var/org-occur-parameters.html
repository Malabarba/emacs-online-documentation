Parameters of the active org-occur calls.</br>
This is a list, each call to org-occur pushes as cons cell,</br>
containing the regular expression and the callback, onto the list.</br>
The list can contain several entries if `org-occur' has been called</br>
several time with the KEEP-PREVIOUS argument.  Otherwise, this list</br>
will only contain one set of parameters.  When the highlights are</br>
removed (for example with `C-c C-c', or with the next edit (depending</br>
on `org-remove-highlights-with-change'), this variable is emptied</br>
as well.
