<strong>org-odd-levels-only</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means skip even levels and only use odd levels for the outline.<br/>
This has the effect that two stars are being added/taken away in<br/>
promotion/demotion commands.  It also influences how levels are<br/>
handled by the exporters.<br/>
Changing it requires restart of `font-lock-mode' to become effective<br/>
for fontification also in regions already fontified.<br/>
You may also set this on a per-file basis by adding one of the following<br/>
lines to the buffer:<br/>
<br/>
   #+STARTUP: odd<br/>
   #+STARTUP: oddeven<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
