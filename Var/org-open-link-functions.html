org-open-link-functions is a variable defined in `org.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hook for functions finding a plain text link.<br/>These functions must take a single argument, the link content.<br/>They will be called for links that look like [[link text][description]]<br/>when LINK TEXT does not have a protocol like "http:" and does not look<br/>like a filename (e.g. "./blue.png").<br/><br/>These functions will be called *before* Org attempts to resolve the<br/>link by doing text searches in the current buffer - so if you want a<br/>link "[[target]]" to still find "<<target>>", your function should<br/>handle this as a special case.<br/><br/>When the function does handle the link, it must return a non-nil value.<br/>If it decides that it is not responsible for this link, it must return<br/>nil to indicate that that Org-mode can continue with other options<br/>like exact and fuzzy text search.
