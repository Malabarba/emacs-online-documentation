<strong>org-outline-path-complete-in-steps</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means complete the outline path in hierarchical steps.</br>
When Org-mode uses the refile interface to select an outline path</br>
(see variable `org-refile-use-outline-path'), the completion of</br>
the path can be done is a single go, or if can be done in steps down</br>
the headline hierarchy.  Going in steps is probably the best if you</br>
do not use a special completion package like `ido' or `icicles'.</br>
However, when using these packages, going in one step can be very</br>
fast, while still showing the whole path to the entry.</br>

You can customize this variable.
