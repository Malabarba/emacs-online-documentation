Documentation:<br/>
Alist of properties and functions to adjust inserted values.<br/>
Elements of this alist must be of the form<br/>
<br/>
  ([string] [function])<br/>
<br/>
where [string] must be a property name and [function] must be a<br/>
lambda expression: this lambda expression must take one argument,<br/>
the value to adjust, and return the new value as a string.<br/>
<br/>
For example, this element will allow the property "Remaining"<br/>
to be updated wrt the relation between the "Effort" property<br/>
and the clock summary:<br/>
<br/>
 (("Remaining" (lambda(value)<br/>
                   (let ((clocksum (org-clock-sum-current-item))<br/>
                         (effort (org-duration-string-to-minutes<br/>
                                   (org-entry-get (point) "Effort"))))<br/>
                     (org-minutes-to-hh:mm-string (- effort clocksum))))))<br/>
