<strong>org-read-date-force-compatible-dates</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Should date/time prompt force dates that are guaranteed to work in Emacs?<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the system Emacs is running on, certain dates cannot<br/>
be represented with the type used internally to represent time.<br/>
Dates between 1970-1-1 and 2038-1-1 can always be represented<br/>
correctly.  Some systems allow for earlier dates, some for later,<br/>
some for both.  One way to find out it to insert any date into an<br/>
Org buffer, putting the cursor on the year and hitting S-up and<br/>
S-down to test the range.<br/>
<br/>
When this variable is set to t, the date/time prompt will not let<br/>
you specify dates outside the 1970-2037 range, so it is certain that<br/>
these dates will work in whatever version of Emacs you are<br/>
running, and also that you can move a file from one Emacs implementation<br/>
to another.  WHenever Org is forcing the year for you, it will display<br/>
a message and beep.<br/>
<br/>
When this variable is nil, Org will check if the date is<br/>
representable in the specific Emacs implementation you are using.<br/>
If not, it will force a year, usually the current year, and beep<br/>
to remind you.  Currently this setting is not recommended because<br/>
the likelihood that you will open your Org files in an Emacs that<br/>
has limited date range is not negligible.<br/>
<br/>
A workaround for this problem is to use diary sexp dates for time<br/>
stamps outside of this range.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
