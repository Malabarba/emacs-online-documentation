<strong>org-read-date-prefer-future</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means assume future for incomplete date input from user.</br>
This affects the following situations:</br>
1. The user gives a month but not a year.</br>
   For example, if it is April and you enter "feb 2", this will be read</br>
   as Feb 2, *next* year.  "May 5", however, will be this year.</br>
2. The user gives a day, but no month.</br>
   For example, if today is the 15th, and you enter "3", Org-mode will</br>
   read this as the third of *next* month.  However, if you enter "17",</br>
   it will be considered as *this* month.</br>
</br>
If you set this variable to the symbol `time', then also the following</br>
will work:</br>
</br>
3. If the user gives a time.</br>
   If the time is before now, it will be interpreted as tomorrow.</br>
</br>
Currently none of this works for ISO week specifications.</br>
</br>
When this option is nil, the current day, month and year will always be</br>
used as defaults.</br>
</br>

You can customize this variable.
