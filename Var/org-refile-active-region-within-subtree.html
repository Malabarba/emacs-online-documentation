<strong>org-refile-active-region-within-subtree</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means also refile active region within a subtree.</br>
</br>
By default `org-refile' doesn't allow refiling regions if they</br>
don't contain a set of subtrees, but it might be convenient to</br>
do so sometimes: in that case, the first line of the region is</br>
converted to a headline before refiling.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
