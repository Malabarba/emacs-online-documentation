<strong>org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means allow to create new nodes as refile targets.<br/>
New nodes are then created by adding "/new node name" to the completion<br/>
of an existing node.  When the value of this variable is `confirm',<br/>
new node creation must be confirmed by the user (recommended)<br/>
When nil, the completion must match an existing entry.<br/>
<br/>
Note that, if the new heading is not seen by the criteria<br/>
listed in `org-refile-targets', multiple instances of the same<br/>
heading would be created by trying again to file under the new<br/>
heading.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
