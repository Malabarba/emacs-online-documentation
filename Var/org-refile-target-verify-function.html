Function to verify if the headline at point should be a refile target.</br>
The function will be called without arguments, with point at the</br>
beginning of the headline.  It should return t and leave point</br>
where it is if the headline is a valid target for refiling.</br>
</br>
If the target should not be selected, the function must return nil.</br>
In addition to this, it may move point to a place from where the search</br>
should be continued.  For example, the function may decide that the entire</br>
subtree of the current entry should be excluded and move point to the end</br>
of the subtree.</br>
