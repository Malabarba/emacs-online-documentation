<strong>org-refile-targets</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Targets for refiling entries with M-x org-refile.<br/>
This is a list of cons cells.  Each cell contains:<br/>
- a specification of the files to be considered, either a list of files,<br/>
  or a symbol whose function or variable value will be used to retrieve<br/>
  a file name or a list of file names.  If you use `org-agenda-files' for<br/>
  that, all agenda files will be scanned for targets.  Nil means consider<br/>
  headings in the current buffer.<br/>
- A specification of how to find candidate refile targets.  This may be<br/>
  any of:<br/>
  - a cons cell (:tag . "TAG") to identify refile targets by a tag.<br/>
    This tag has to be present in all target headlines, inheritance will<br/>
    not be considered.<br/>
  - a cons cell (:todo . "KEYWORD") to identify refile targets by<br/>
    todo keyword.<br/>
  - a cons cell (:regexp . "REGEXP") with a regular expression matching<br/>
    headlines that are refiling targets.<br/>
  - a cons cell (:level . N).  Any headline of level N is considered a target.<br/>
    Note that, when `org-odd-levels-only' is set, level corresponds to<br/>
    order in hierarchy, not to the number of stars.<br/>
  - a cons cell (:maxlevel . N).  Any headline with level <= N is a target.<br/>
    Note that, when `org-odd-levels-only' is set, level corresponds to<br/>
    order in hierarchy, not to the number of stars.<br/>
<br/>
Each element of this list generates a set of possible targets.<br/>
The union of these sets is presented (with completion) to<br/>
the user by `org-refile'.<br/>
<br/>
You can set the variable `org-refile-target-verify-function' to a function<br/>
to verify each headline found by the simple criteria above.<br/>
<br/>
When this variable is nil, all top-level headlines in the current buffer<br/>
are used, equivalent to the value `((nil . (:level . 1))'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
