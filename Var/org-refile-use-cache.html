<strong>org-refile-use-cache</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means cache refile targets to speed up the process.<br/>
The cache for a particular file will be updated automatically when<br/>
the buffer has been killed, or when any of the marker used for flagging<br/>
refile targets no longer points at a live buffer.<br/>
If you have added new entries to a buffer that might themselves be targets,<br/>
you need to clear the cache manually by pressing `C-0 C-c C-w' or, if you<br/>
find that easier, `C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
