<strong>org-refile-use-outline-path</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means provide refile targets as paths.</br>
So a level 3 headline will be available as level1/level2/level3.</br>
</br>
When the value is `file', also include the file name (without directory)</br>
into the path.  In this case, you can also stop the completion after</br>
the file name, to get entries inserted as top level in the file.</br>
</br>
When `full-file-path', include the full file path.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
