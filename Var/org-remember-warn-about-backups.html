<strong>org-remember-warn-about-backups</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-remember.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means warn about backup files in `org-remember-backup-directory'.<br/>
<br/>
Set this to nil if you find that you don't need the warning.<br/>
<br/>
If you cancel remember calls frequently and know when they<br/>
contain useful information (because you know that you made an<br/>
error or Emacs crashed, for example) nil is more useful.  In the<br/>
opposite case, the default, t, is more useful.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
