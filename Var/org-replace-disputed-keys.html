<strong>org-replace-disputed-keys</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means use alternative key bindings for some keys.</br>
Org-mode uses S-<cursor> keys for changing timestamps and priorities.</br>
These keys are also used by other packages like shift-selection-mode'</br>
(built into Emacs 23), `CUA-mode' or `windmove.el'.</br>
If you want to use Org-mode together with one of these other modes,</br>
or more generally if you would like to move some Org-mode commands to</br>
other keys, set this variable and configure the keys with the variable</br>
`org-disputed-keys'.</br>
</br>
This option is only relevant at load-time of Org-mode, and must be set</br>
*before* org.el is loaded.  Changing it requires a restart of Emacs to</br>
become effective.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
