Non-nil means cluster self-insert commands for undo when possible.</br>
If this is set, then, like in the Emacs command loop, 20 consecutive</br>
characters will be undone together.</br>
This is configurable, because there is some impact on typing performance.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
