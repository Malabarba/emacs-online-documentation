Its value is <pre>((default))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means show the entry below a headline when revealing a location.</br>
Org-mode often shows locations in an org-mode file which might have</br>
been invisible before.  When this is set, the text below the headline that is</br>
exposed is also shown.</br>
</br>
By default this is off for all contexts.</br>
Instead of t, this can also be an alist specifying this option for different</br>
contexts.  See `org-show-hierarchy-above' for valid contexts.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
