<strong>org-show-following-heading</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>((default))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means show following heading when revealing a location.</br>
Org-mode often shows locations in an org-mode file which might have</br>
been invisible before.  When this is set, the heading following the</br>
match is shown.</br>
Turning this off for example for sparse trees makes them very compact,</br>
but makes it harder to edit the location of the match.  In such a case,</br>
use the command M-x org-reveal to show more context.</br>
Instead of t, this can also be an alist specifying this option for different</br>
contexts.  See `org-show-hierarchy-above' for valid contexts.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
