<strong>org-show-siblings</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>((default) (isearch t) (bookmark-jump t))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means show all sibling heading when revealing a location.</br>
Org-mode often shows locations in an org-mode file which might have</br>
been invisible before.  When this is set, the sibling of the current entry</br>
heading are all made visible.  If `org-show-hierarchy-above' is t,</br>
the same happens on each level of the hierarchy above the current entry.</br>
</br>
By default this is on for the isearch context, off for all other contexts.</br>
Turning this off for example for sparse trees makes them very compact,</br>
but makes it harder to edit the location of the match.  In such a case,</br>
use the command M-x org-reveal to show more context.</br>
Instead of t, this can also be an alist specifying this option for different</br>
contexts.  See `org-show-hierarchy-above' for valid contexts.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
