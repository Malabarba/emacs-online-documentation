<strong>org-sort-agenda-notime-is-late</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-agenda.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means items without time are considered late.<br/>
This is only relevant for sorting.  When t, items which have no explicit<br/>
time like 15:30 will be considered as 99:01, i.e. later than any items which<br/>
do have a time.  When nil, the default time is before 0:00.  You can use this<br/>
option to decide if the schedule for today should come before or after timeless<br/>
agenda entries.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
