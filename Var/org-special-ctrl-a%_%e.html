org-special-ctrl-a/e is a variable defined in `org.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means `C-a' and `C-e' behave specially in headlines and items.<br/><br/>When t, `C-a' will bring back the cursor to the beginning of the<br/>headline text, i.e. after the stars and after a possible TODO<br/>keyword.  In an item, this will be the position after bullet and<br/>check-box, if any.  When the cursor is already at that position,<br/>another `C-a' will bring it to the beginning of the line.<br/><br/>`C-e' will jump to the end of the headline, ignoring the presence<br/>of tags in the headline.  A second `C-e' will then jump to the<br/>true end of the line, after any tags.  This also means that, when<br/>this variable is non-nil, `C-e' also will never jump beyond the<br/>end of the heading of a folded section, i.e. not after the<br/>ellipses.<br/><br/>When set to the symbol `reversed', the first `C-a' or `C-e' works<br/>normally, going to the true line boundary first.  Only a directly<br/>following, identical keypress will bring the cursor to the<br/>special positions.<br/><br/>This may also be a cons cell where the behavior for `C-a' and<br/>`C-e' is set separately.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
