Hook for activating speed commands at strategic locations.</br>
Hook functions are called in sequence until a valid handler is</br>
found.</br>
</br>
Each hook takes a single argument, a user-pressed command key</br>
which is also a `self-insert-command' from the global map.</br>
</br>
Within the hook, examine the cursor position and the command key</br>
and return nil or a valid handler as appropriate.  Handler could</br>
be one of an interactive command, a function, or a form.</br>
</br>
Set `org-use-speed-commands' to non-nil value to enable this</br>
hook.  The default setting is `org-speed-command-activate'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
