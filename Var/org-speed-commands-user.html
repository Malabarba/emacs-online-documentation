<strong>org-speed-commands-user</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist of additional speed commands.<br/>
This list will be checked before `org-speed-commands-default'<br/>
when the variable `org-use-speed-commands' is non-nil<br/>
and when the cursor is at the beginning of a headline.<br/>
The car if each entry is a string with a single letter, which must<br/>
be assigned to `self-insert-command' in the global map.<br/>
The cdr is either a command to be called interactively, a function<br/>
to be called, or a form to be evaluated.<br/>
An entry that is just a list with a single string will be interpreted<br/>
as a descriptive headline that will be added when listing the speed<br/>
commands in the Help buffer using the `?' speed command.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
