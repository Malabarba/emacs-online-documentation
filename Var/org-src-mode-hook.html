- When formatting a source code snippet for export with htmlize.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to use this hook for example to turn off `outline-minor-mode'<br/>
or similar things which you want to have when editing a source code file,<br/>
but which mess up the display of a snippet in Org exported files.
