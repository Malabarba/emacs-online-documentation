<strong>org-startup-folded</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means entering Org-mode will switch to OVERVIEW.</br>
This can also be configured on a per-file basis by adding one of</br>
the following lines anywhere in the buffer:</br>
</br>
   #+STARTUP: fold              (or `overview', this is equivalent)</br>
   #+STARTUP: nofold            (or `showall', this is equivalent)</br>
   #+STARTUP: content</br>
   #+STARTUP: showeverything</br>
</br>
By default, this option is ignored when Org opens agenda files</br>
for the first time.  If you want the agenda to honor the startup</br>
option, set `org-agenda-inhibit-startup' to nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
