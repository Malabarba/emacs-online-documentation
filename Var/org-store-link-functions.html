Documentation:<br/>
List of functions that are called to create and store a link.<br/>
Each function will be called in turn until one returns a non-nil<br/>
value.  Each function should check if it is responsible for creating<br/>
this link (for example by looking at the major mode).<br/>
If not, it must exit and return nil.<br/>
If yes, it should return a non-nil value after a calling<br/>
`org-store-link-props' with a list of properties and values.<br/>
Special properties are:<br/>
<br/>
:type         The link prefix, like "http".  This must be given.<br/>
:link         The link, like "http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik".<br/>
              This is obligatory as well.<br/>
:description  Optional default description for the second pair<br/>
              of brackets in an Org-mode link.  The user can still change<br/>
              this when inserting this link into an Org-mode buffer.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these, any additional properties can be specified<br/>
and then used in capture templates.
