org-stuck-projects is a variable defined in `org-agenda.el'.<br/>Its value is ("+LEVEL=2/-DONE" ("TODO" "NEXT" "NEXTACTION") nil "")<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>How to identify stuck projects.<br/>This is a list of four items:<br/>1. A tags/todo/property matcher string that is used to identify a project.<br/>   See the manual for a description of tag and property searches.<br/>   The entire tree below a headline matched by this is considered one project.<br/>2. A list of TODO keywords identifying non-stuck projects.<br/>   If the project subtree contains any headline with one of these todo<br/>   keywords, the project is considered to be not stuck.  If you specify<br/>   "*" as a keyword, any TODO keyword will mark the project unstuck.<br/>3. A list of tags identifying non-stuck projects.<br/>   If the project subtree contains any headline with one of these tags,<br/>   the project is considered to be not stuck.  If you specify "*" as<br/>   a tag, any tag will mark the project unstuck.  Note that this is about<br/>   the explicit presence of a tag somewhere in the subtree, inherited<br/>   tags do not count here.  If inherited tags make a project not stuck,<br/>   use "-TAG" in the tags part of the matcher under (1.) above.<br/>4. An arbitrary regular expression matching non-stuck projects.<br/><br/>If the project turns out to be not stuck, search continues also in the<br/>subtree to see if any of the subtasks have project status.<br/><br/>See also the variable `org-tags-match-list-sublevels' which applies<br/>to projects matched by this search as well.<br/><br/>After defining this variable, you may use M-x org-agenda-list-stuck-projects<br/>or `C-c a #' to produce the list.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
