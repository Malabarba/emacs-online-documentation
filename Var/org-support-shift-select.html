Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means make shift-cursor commands select text when possible.</br>
</br>
In Emacs 23, when `shift-select-mode' is on, shifted cursor keys</br>
start selecting a region, or enlarge regions started in this way.</br>
In Org-mode, in special contexts, these same keys are used for</br>
other purposes, important enough to compete with shift selection.</br>
Org tries to balance these needs by supporting `shift-select-mode'</br>
outside these special contexts, under control of this variable.</br>
</br>
The default of this variable is nil, to avoid confusing behavior.  Shifted</br>
cursor keys will then execute Org commands in the following contexts:</br>
- on a headline, changing TODO state (left/right) and priority (up/down)</br>
- on a time stamp, changing the time</br>
- in a plain list item, changing the bullet type</br>
- in a property definition line, switching between allowed values</br>
- in the BEGIN line of a clock table (changing the time block).</br>
Outside these contexts, the commands will throw an error.</br>
</br>
When this variable is t and the cursor is not in a special</br>
context, Org-mode will support shift-selection for making and</br>
enlarging regions.  To make this more effective, the bullet</br>
cycling will no longer happen anywhere in an item line, but only</br>
if the cursor is exactly on the bullet.</br>
</br>
If you set this variable to the symbol `always', then the keys</br>
will not be special in headlines, property lines, and item lines,</br>
to make shift selection work there as well.  If this is what you</br>
want, you can use the following alternative commands: `C-c C-t'</br>
and `C-c ,' to change TODO state and priority, `C-u C-u C-c C-t'</br>
can be used to switch TODO sets, `C-c -' to cycle item bullet</br>
types, and properties can be edited by hand or in column view.</br>
</br>
However, when the cursor is on a timestamp, shift-cursor commands</br>
will still edit the time stamp - this is just too good to give up.</br>
</br>
XEmacs user should have this variable set to nil, because</br>
`shift-select-mode' is in Emacs 23 or later only.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
