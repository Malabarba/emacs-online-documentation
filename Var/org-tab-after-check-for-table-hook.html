Hook for functions to attach themselves to TAB.</br>
See `org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook' for more information.</br>
This hook runs after it has been established that the cursor is not in a</br>
table, but before checking if the cursor is in a headline or if global cycling</br>
should be done.</br>
If any function in this hook returns t, not other actions like visibility</br>
cycling will be done.
