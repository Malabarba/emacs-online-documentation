Documentation:<br/>
Hook for functions to attach themselves to TAB.<br/>
See `org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook' for more information.<br/>
This hook runs as the first action when TAB is pressed, even before<br/>
`org-cycle' messes around with the `outline-regexp' to cater for<br/>
inline tasks and plain list item folding.<br/>
If any function in this hook returns t, any other actions that<br/>
would have been caused by TAB (such as table field motion or visibility<br/>
cycling) will not occur.
