<strong>org-tab-follows-link</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means on links TAB will follow the link.<br/>
Needs to be set before org.el is loaded.<br/>
This really should not be used, it does not make sense, and the<br/>
implementation is bad.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
