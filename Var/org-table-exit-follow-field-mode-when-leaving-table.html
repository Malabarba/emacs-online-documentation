<strong>org-table-exit-follow-field-mode-when-leaving-table</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org-table.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means automatically exit the follow mode.</br>
When nil, the follow mode will stay on and be active in any table</br>
the cursor enters.  Since the table follow filed mode messes with the</br>
window configuration, it is not recommended to set this variable to nil,</br>
except maybe locally in a special file that has mostly tables with long</br>
fields.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
