Alist with constant names and values, for use in table formulas.</br>
The car of each element is a name of a constant, without the `$' before it.</br>
The cdr is the value as a string.  For example, if you'd like to use the</br>
speed of light in a formula, you would configure</br>
</br>
  (setq org-table-formula-constants '(("c" . "299792458.")))</br>
</br>
and then use it in an equation like `$1*$c'.</br>
</br>
Constants can also be defined on a per-file basis using a line like</br>
</br>
#+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6</br>
</br>
