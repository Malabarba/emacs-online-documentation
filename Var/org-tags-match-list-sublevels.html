org-tags-match-list-sublevels is a variable defined in `org.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means list also sublevels of headlines matching a search.<br/>This variable applies to tags/property searches, and also to stuck<br/>projects because this search is based on a tags match as well.<br/><br/>When set to the symbol `indented', sublevels are indented with<br/>leading dots.<br/><br/>Because of tag inheritance (see variable `org-use-tag-inheritance'),<br/>the sublevels of a headline matching a tag search often also match<br/>the same search.  Listing all of them can create very long lists.<br/>Setting this variable to nil causes subtrees of a match to be skipped.<br/><br/>This variable is semi-obsolete and probably should always be true.  It<br/>is better to limit inheritance to certain tags using the variables<br/>`org-use-tag-inheritance' and `org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
