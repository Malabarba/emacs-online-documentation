Its value is <pre></br>
(:days "%dd " :hours "%d" :require-hours t :minutes ":%02d" :require-minutes t)
</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The format string used when creating CLOCKSUM lines.</br>
This is also used when Org mode generates a time duration.</br>
</br>
The value can be a single format string containing two</br>
%-sequences, which will be filled with the number of hours and</br>
minutes in that order.</br>
</br>
Alternatively, the value can be a plist associating any of the</br>
keys :years, :months, :weeks, :days, :hours or :minutes with</br>
format strings.  The time duration is formatted using only the</br>
time components that are needed and concatenating the results.</br>
If a time unit in absent, it falls back to the next smallest</br>
unit.</br>
</br>
The keys :require-years, :require-months, :require-days,</br>
:require-weeks, :require-hours, :require-minutes are also</br>
meaningful.  A non-nil value for these keys indicates that the</br>
corresponding time component should always be included, even if</br>
its value is 0.</br>
</br>
</br>
For example,</br>
</br>
  (:days "%dd" :hours "%d" :require-hours t :minutes ":%02d"</br>
    :require-minutes t)</br>
</br>
means durations longer than a day will be expressed in days,</br>
hours and minutes, and durations less than a day will always be</br>
expressed in hours and minutes (even for durations less than an</br>
hour).</br>
</br>
The value</br>
</br>
  (:days "%dd" :minutes "%dm")</br>
</br>
means durations longer than a day will be expressed in days and</br>
minutes, and durations less than a day will be expressed entirely</br>
in minutes (even for durations longer than an hour).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
