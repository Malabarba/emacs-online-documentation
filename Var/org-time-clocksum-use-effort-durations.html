<strong>org-time-clocksum-use-effort-durations</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, M-x org-clock-display uses effort durations.</br>
E.g. by default, one day is considered to be a 8 hours effort,</br>
so a task that has been clocked for 16 hours will be displayed</br>
as during 2 days in the clock display or in the clocktable.</br>
</br>
See `org-effort-durations' on how to set effort durations</br>
and `org-time-clocksum-format' for more on time clock formats.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
