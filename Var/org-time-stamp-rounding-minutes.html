<strong>org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>(0 5)</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Number of minutes to round time stamps to.</br>
These are two values, the first applies when first creating a time stamp.</br>
The second applies when changing it with the commands `S-up' and `S-down'.</br>
When changing the time stamp, this means that it will change in steps</br>
of N minutes, as given by the second value.</br>
</br>
When a setting is 0 or 1, insert the time unmodified.  Useful rounding</br>
numbers should be factors of 60, so for example 5, 10, 15.</br>
</br>
When this is larger than 1, you can still force an exact time stamp by using</br>
a double prefix argument to a time stamp command like `C-c .' or `C-c !',</br>
and by using a prefix arg to `S-up/down' to specify the exact number</br>
of minutes to shift.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
