Documentation:<br/>
Faces for specific TODO keywords.<br/>
This is a list of cons cells, with TODO keywords in the car<br/>
and faces in the cdr.  The face can be a symbol, a color<br/>
as a string (in which case the rest is inherited from the `org-todo' face),<br/>
or a property list of attributes, like<br/>
   (:foreground "blue" :weight bold :underline t).<br/>
If it is a color string, the variable `org-faces-easy-properties'<br/>
determines if it is a foreground or a background color.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
