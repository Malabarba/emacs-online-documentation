Its value is <pre>((sequence "TODO" "DONE"))</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of TODO entry keyword sequences and their interpretation.</br>
This is a list of sequences.</br>
</br>
Each sequence starts with a symbol, either `sequence' or `type',</br>
indicating if the keywords should be interpreted as a sequence of</br>
action steps, or as different types of TODO items.  The first</br>
keywords are states requiring action - these states will select a headline</br>
for inclusion into the global TODO list Org-mode produces.  If one of</br>
the "keywords" is the vertical bar, "|", the remaining keywords</br>
signify that no further action is necessary.  If "|" is not found,</br>
the last keyword is treated as the only DONE state of the sequence.</br>
</br>
The command C-c C-t cycles an entry through these states, and one</br>
additional state where no keyword is present.  For details about this</br>
cycling, see the manual.</br>
</br>
TODO keywords and interpretation can also be set on a per-file basis with</br>
the special #+SEQ_TODO and #+TYP_TODO lines.</br>
</br>
Each keyword can optionally specify a character for fast state selection</br>
(in combination with the variable `org-use-fast-todo-selection')</br>
and specifiers for state change logging, using the same syntax that</br>
is used in the "#+TODO:" lines.  For example, "WAIT(w)" says that</br>
the WAIT state can be selected with the "w" key.  "WAIT(w!)"</br>
indicates to record a time stamp each time this state is selected.</br>
</br>
Each keyword may also specify if a timestamp or a note should be</br>
recorded when entering or leaving the state, by adding additional</br>
characters in the parenthesis after the keyword.  This looks like this:</br>
"WAIT(w@/!)".  "@" means to add a note (with time), "!" means to</br>
record only the time of the state change.  With X and Y being either</br>
"@" or "!", "X/Y" means use X when entering the state, and use</br>
Y when leaving the state if and only if the *target* state does not</br>
define X.  You may omit any of the fast-selection key or X or /Y,</br>
so WAIT(w@), WAIT(w/@) and WAIT(@/@) are all valid.</br>
</br>
For backward compatibility, this variable may also be just a list</br>
of keywords.  In this case the interpretation (sequence or type) will be</br>
taken from the (otherwise obsolete) variable `org-todo-interpretation'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
