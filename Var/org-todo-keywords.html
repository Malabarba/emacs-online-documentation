<strong>org-todo-keywords</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is ((sequence "TODO" "DONE"))<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of TODO entry keyword sequences and their interpretation.<br/>
This is a list of sequences.<br/>
<br/>
Each sequence starts with a symbol, either `sequence' or `type',<br/>
indicating if the keywords should be interpreted as a sequence of<br/>
action steps, or as different types of TODO items.  The first<br/>
keywords are states requiring action - these states will select a headline<br/>
for inclusion into the global TODO list Org-mode produces.  If one of<br/>
the "keywords" is the vertical bar, "|", the remaining keywords<br/>
signify that no further action is necessary.  If "|" is not found,<br/>
the last keyword is treated as the only DONE state of the sequence.<br/>
<br/>
The command C-c C-t cycles an entry through these states, and one<br/>
additional state where no keyword is present.  For details about this<br/>
cycling, see the manual.<br/>
<br/>
TODO keywords and interpretation can also be set on a per-file basis with<br/>
the special #+SEQ_TODO and #+TYP_TODO lines.<br/>
<br/>
Each keyword can optionally specify a character for fast state selection<br/>
(in combination with the variable `org-use-fast-todo-selection')<br/>
and specifiers for state change logging, using the same syntax that<br/>
is used in the "#+TODO:" lines.  For example, "WAIT(w)" says that<br/>
the WAIT state can be selected with the "w" key.  "WAIT(w!)"<br/>
indicates to record a time stamp each time this state is selected.<br/>
<br/>
Each keyword may also specify if a timestamp or a note should be<br/>
recorded when entering or leaving the state, by adding additional<br/>
characters in the parenthesis after the keyword.  This looks like this:<br/>
"WAIT(w@/!)".  "@" means to add a note (with time), "!" means to<br/>
record only the time of the state change.  With X and Y being either<br/>
"@" or "!", "X/Y" means use X when entering the state, and use<br/>
Y when leaving the state if and only if the *target* state does not<br/>
define X.  You may omit any of the fast-selection key or X or /Y,<br/>
so WAIT(w@), WAIT(w/@) and WAIT(@/@) are all valid.<br/>
<br/>
For backward compatibility, this variable may also be just a list<br/>
of keywords.  In this case the interpretation (sequence or type) will be<br/>
taken from the (otherwise obsolete) variable `org-todo-interpretation'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
