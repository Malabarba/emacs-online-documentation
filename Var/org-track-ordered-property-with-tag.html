<strong>org-track-ordered-property-with-tag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Should the ORDERED property also be shown as a tag?<br/>
The ORDERED property decides if an entry should require subtasks to be<br/>
completed in sequence.  Since a property is not very visible, setting<br/>
this option means that toggling the ORDERED property with the command<br/>
`org-toggle-ordered-property' will also toggle a tag ORDERED.  That tag is<br/>
not relevant for the behavior, but it makes things more visible.<br/>
<br/>
Note that toggling the tag with tags commands will not change the property<br/>
and therefore not influence behavior!<br/>
<br/>
This can be t, meaning the tag ORDERED should be used,  It can also be a<br/>
string to select a different tag for this task.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
