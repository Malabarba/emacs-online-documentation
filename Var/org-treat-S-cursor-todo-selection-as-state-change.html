Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means switching TODO states with S-cursor counts as state change.</br>
This is the default behavior.  However, setting this to nil allows a</br>
convenient way to select a TODO state and bypass any logging associated</br>
with that.</br>

You can customize this variable.
