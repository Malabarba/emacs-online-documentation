<strong>org-trust-scanner-tags</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Should `org-get-tags-at' use the tags for the scanner.</br>
This is for internal dynamical scoping only.</br>
When this is non-nil, the function `org-get-tags-at' will return the value</br>
of `org-scanner-tags' instead of building the list by itself.  This</br>
can lead to large speed-ups when the tags scanner is used in a file with</br>
many entries, and when the list of tags is retrieved, for example to</br>
obtain a list of properties.  Building the tags list for each entry in such</br>
a file becomes an N^2 operation - but with this variable set, it scales</br>
as N.
