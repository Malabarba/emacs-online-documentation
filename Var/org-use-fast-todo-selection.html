<strong>org-use-fast-todo-selection</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means use the fast todo selection scheme with C-c C-t.<br/>
This variable describes if and under what circumstances the cycling<br/>
mechanism for TODO keywords will be replaced by a single-key, direct<br/>
selection scheme.<br/>
<br/>
When nil, fast selection is never used.<br/>
<br/>
When the symbol `prefix', it will be used when `org-todo' is called<br/>
with a prefix argument,  i.e. `C-u C-c C-t' in an Org-mode buffer, and<br/>
`C-u t' in an agenda buffer.<br/>
<br/>
When t, fast selection is used by default.  In this case, the prefix<br/>
argument forces cycling instead.<br/>
<br/>
In all cases, the special interface is only used if access keys have<br/>
actually been assigned by the user, i.e. if keywords in the configuration<br/>
are followed by a letter in parenthesis, like TODO(t).<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
