<strong>org-use-property-inheritance</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means properties apply also for sublevels.</br>
</br>
This setting is chiefly used during property searches.  Turning it on can</br>
cause significant overhead when doing a search, which is why it is not</br>
on by default.</br>
</br>
When nil, only the properties directly given in the current entry count.</br>
When t, every property is inherited.  The value may also be a list of</br>
properties that should have inheritance, or a regular expression matching</br>
properties that should be inherited.</br>
</br>
However, note that some special properties use inheritance under special</br>
circumstances (not in searches).  Examples are CATEGORY, ARCHIVE, COLUMNS,</br>
and the properties ending in "_ALL" when they are used as descriptor</br>
for valid values of a property.</br>
</br>
Note for programmers:</br>
When querying an entry with `org-entry-get',  you can control if inheritance</br>
should be used.  By default, `org-entry-get' looks only at the local</br>
properties.  You can request inheritance by setting the inherit argument</br>
to t (to force inheritance) or to `selective' (to respect the setting</br>
in this variable).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
