<strong>org-use-tag-inheritance</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>org.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means tags in levels apply also for sublevels.<br/>
When nil, only the tags directly given in a specific line apply there.<br/>
This may also be a list of tags that should be inherited, or a regexp that<br/>
matches tags that should be inherited.  Additional control is possible<br/>
with the variable  `org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance' which gives an<br/>
explicit list of tags to be excluded from inheritance, even if the value of<br/>
`org-use-tag-inheritance' would select it for inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
If this option is t, a match early-on in a tree can lead to a large<br/>
number of matches in the subtree when constructing the agenda or creating<br/>
a sparse tree.  If you only want to see the first match in a tree during<br/>
a search, check out the variable `org-tags-match-list-sublevels'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
