<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means when yanking subtrees, fold them.</br>
If the kill is a single subtree, or a sequence of subtrees, i.e. if</br>
it starts with a heading and all other headings in it are either children</br>
or siblings, then fold all the subtrees.  However, do this only if no</br>
text after the yank would be swallowed into a folded tree by this action.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
