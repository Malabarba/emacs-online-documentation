<strong>out-of-memory-warning-percentage</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Warn if file size exceeds this percentage of available free memory.</br>
When nil, never issue warning.  Beware: This probably doesn't do what you</br>
think it does, because "free" is pretty hard to define in practice.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
