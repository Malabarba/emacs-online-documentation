<strong>outline-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>outline.el</code>'.</br>

  satisfies the predicate `stringp'.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Regular expression to match the beginning of a heading.</br>
Any line whose beginning matches this regexp is considered to start a heading.</br>
Note that Outline mode only checks this regexp at the start of a line,</br>
so the regexp need not (and usually does not) start with `^'.</br>
The recommended way to set this is with a Local Variables: list</br>
in the file it applies to.  See also `outline-heading-end-regexp'.
