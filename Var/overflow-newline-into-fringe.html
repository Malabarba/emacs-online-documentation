Non-nil means that newline may flow into the right fringe.</br>
This means that display lines which are exactly as wide as the window</br>
(not counting the final newline) will only occupy one screen line, by</br>
showing (or hiding) the final newline in the right fringe; when point</br>
is at the final newline, the cursor is shown in the right fringe.</br>
If nil, also continue lines which are exactly as wide as the window.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
