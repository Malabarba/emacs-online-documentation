Documentation:<br/>
Per-terminal keymap that overrides all other local keymaps.<br/>
If this variable is non-nil, it is used as a keymap instead of the<br/>
buffer's local map, and the minor mode keymaps and text property keymaps.<br/>
It also replaces `overriding-local-map'.<br/>
<br/>
This variable is intended to let commands such as `universal-argument'<br/>
set up a different keymap for reading the next command.<br/>
<br/>
`overriding-terminal-local-map' has a separate binding for each<br/>
terminal device.<br/>
