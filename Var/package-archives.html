An alist of archives from which to fetch.<br/>

<br/>
Each element has the form (ID . LOCATION).<br/>
 ID is an archive name, as a string.<br/>
 LOCATION specifies the base location for the archive.<br/>
  If it starts with "http:", it is treated as a HTTP URL;<br/>
  otherwise it should be an absolute directory name.<br/>
  (Other types of URL are currently not supported.)<br/>
<br/>

a package can run arbitrary code.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
