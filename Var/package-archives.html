An alist of archives from which to fetch.</br>
The default value points to the GNU Emacs package repository.</br>
</br>
Each element has the form (ID . LOCATION).</br>
 ID is an archive name, as a string.</br>
 LOCATION specifies the base location for the archive.</br>
  If it starts with "http:", it is treated as a HTTP URL;</br>
  otherwise it should be an absolute directory name.</br>
  (Other types of URL are currently not supported.)</br>
</br>
Only add locations that you trust, since fetching and installing</br>
a package can run arbitrary code.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
