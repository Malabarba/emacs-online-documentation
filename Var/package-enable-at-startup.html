Whether to activate installed packages when Emacs starts.</br>
If non-nil, packages are activated after reading the init file</br>
and before `after-init-hook'.  Activation is not done if</br>
`user-init-file' is nil (e.g. Emacs was started with "-q").</br>
</br>
Even if the value is nil, you can type M-x package-initialize to</br>
activate the package system at any time.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
