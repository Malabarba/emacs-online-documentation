List of packages for `package-initialize' to load.</br>
Each element in this list should be a list (NAME VERSION), or the</br>
symbol `all'.  The symbol `all' says to load the latest installed</br>
versions of all packages not specified by other elements.</br>
</br>
For an element (NAME VERSION), NAME is a package name (a symbol).</br>
VERSION should be t, a string, or nil.</br>
If VERSION is t, the most recent version is activated.</br>
If VERSION is a string, only that version is ever loaded.</br>
 Any other version, even if newer, is silently ignored.</br>
 Hence, the package is "held" at that version.</br>
If VERSION is nil, the package is not loaded (it is "disabled").</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
