Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
An alist of packages that are pinned to specific archives.</br>
This can be useful if you have multiple package archives enabled,</br>
and want to control which archive a given package gets installed from.</br>
</br>
Each element of the alist has the form (PACKAGE . ARCHIVE), where:</br>
 PACKAGE is a symbol representing a package</br>
 ARCHIVE is a string representing an archive (it should be the car of</br>
an element in `package-archives', e.g. "gnu").</br>
</br>
Adding an entry to this variable means that only ARCHIVE will be</br>
considered as a source for PACKAGE.  If other archives provide PACKAGE,</br>
they are ignored (for this package).  If ARCHIVE does not contain PACKAGE,</br>
the package will be unavailable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
