<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp for beginning of a line that separates paragraphs.<br/>
If you change this, you may have to change `paragraph-start' also.<br/>
<br/>
This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily<br/>
the beginning of the line, so it should not use "^" as an anchor.  This<br/>
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally within a region of<br/>
text indented by a margin setting.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
