Documentation:<br/>
Regexp for beginning of a line that starts OR separates paragraphs.<br/>
This regexp should match lines that separate paragraphs<br/>
and should also match lines that start a paragraph<br/>
(and are part of that paragraph).<br/>
<br/>
This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily<br/>
the beginning of the line, so it should never use "^" as an anchor.  This<br/>
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally well within a region<br/>
of text indented by a margin setting.<br/>
<br/>
The variable `paragraph-separate' specifies how to distinguish<br/>
lines that start paragraphs from lines that separate them.<br/>
<br/>
If the variable `use-hard-newlines' is non-nil, then only lines following a<br/>
hard newline are considered to match.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
