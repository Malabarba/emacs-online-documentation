Regexp for beginning of a line that starts OR separates paragraphs.</br>
This regexp should match lines that separate paragraphs</br>
and should also match lines that start a paragraph</br>
(and are part of that paragraph).</br>
</br>
This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily</br>
the beginning of the line, so it should never use "^" as an anchor.  This</br>
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally well within a region</br>
of text indented by a margin setting.</br>
</br>
The variable `paragraph-separate' specifies how to distinguish</br>
lines that start paragraphs from lines that separate them.</br>
</br>
If the variable `use-hard-newlines' is non-nil, then only lines following a</br>
hard newline are considered to match.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
