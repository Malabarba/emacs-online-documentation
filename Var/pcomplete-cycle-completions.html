<strong>pcomplete-cycle-completions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>pcomplete.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, hitting the TAB key cycles through the completion list.</br>
Typical Emacs behavior is to complete as much as possible, then pause</br>
waiting for further input.  Then if TAB is hit again, show a list of</br>
possible completions.  When `pcomplete-cycle-completions' is non-nil,</br>
it acts more like zsh or 4nt, showing the first maximal match first,</br>
followed by any further matches on each subsequent pressing of the TAB</br>
key.  M-x pcomplete-list is the key to press if the user wants to see</br>
the list of possible completions.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
