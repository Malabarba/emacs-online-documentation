<strong>pcomplete-cycle-cutoff-length</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>pcomplete.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 5<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If the number of completions is greater than this, don't cycle.<br/>
This variable is a compromise between the traditional Emacs style of<br/>
completion, and the "cycling" style.  Basically, if there are more<br/>
than this number of completions possible, don't automatically pick the<br/>
first one and then expect the user to press TAB to cycle through them.<br/>
Typically, when there are a large number of completion possibilities,<br/>
the user wants to see them in a list buffer so that they can know what<br/>
options are available.  But if the list is small, it means the user<br/>
has already entered enough input to disambiguate most of the<br/>
possibilities, and therefore they are probably most interested in<br/>
cycling through the candidates.  Set this value to nil if you want<br/>
cycling to always be enabled.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
