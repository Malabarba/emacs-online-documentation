Its value is <pre>5</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If the number of completions is greater than this, don't cycle.</br>
This variable is a compromise between the traditional Emacs style of</br>
completion, and the "cycling" style.  Basically, if there are more</br>
than this number of completions possible, don't automatically pick the</br>
first one and then expect the user to press TAB to cycle through them.</br>
Typically, when there are a large number of completion possibilities,</br>
the user wants to see them in a list buffer so that they can know what</br>
options are available.  But if the list is small, it means the user</br>
has already entered enough input to disambiguate most of the</br>
possibilities, and therefore they are probably most interested in</br>
cycling through the candidates.  Set this value to nil if you want</br>
cycling to always be enabled.</br>

You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
