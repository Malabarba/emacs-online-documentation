<strong>pcomplete-expand-before-complete</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>pcomplete.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, expand the current argument before completing it.<br/>
This means that typing something such as '$HOME/bi' followed by<br/>
M-x pcomplete-argument will cause the variable reference to be<br/>
resolved first, and the resultant value that will be completed against<br/>
to be inserted in the buffer.  Note that exactly what gets expanded<br/>
and how is entirely up to the behavior of the<br/>
`pcomplete-parse-arguments-function'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
