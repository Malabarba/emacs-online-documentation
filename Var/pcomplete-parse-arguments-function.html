A function to call to parse the current line's arguments.</br>
It should be called with no parameters, and with point at the position</br>
of the argument that is to be completed.</br>
</br>
It must either return nil, or a cons cell of the form:</br>
</br>
  ((ARG...) (BEG-POS...))</br>
</br>
The two lists must be identical in length.  The first gives the final</br>
value of each command line argument (which need not match the textual</br>
representation of that argument), and BEG-POS gives the beginning</br>
position of each argument, as it is seen by the user.  The establishes</br>
a relationship between the fully resolved value of the argument, and</br>
the textual representation of the argument.</br>
