</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The number of seconds to wait before restoring completion windows.</br>
Once the completion window has been displayed, if the user then goes</br>
on to type something else, that completion window will be removed from</br>
the display (actually, the original window configuration before it was</br>
displayed will be restored), after this many seconds of idle time.  If</br>
set to nil, completion windows will be left on second until the user</br>
removes them manually.  If set to 0, they will disappear immediately</br>
after the user enters a key other than TAB.</br>

You can customize this variable.
