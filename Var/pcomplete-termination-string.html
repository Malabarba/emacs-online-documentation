</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A string that is inserted after any completion or expansion.</br>
This is usually a space character, useful when completing lists of</br>
words separated by spaces.  However, if your list uses a different</br>
separator character, or if the completion occurs in a word that is</br>
already terminated by a character, this variable should be locally</br>
modified to be an empty string, or the desired separation string.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
