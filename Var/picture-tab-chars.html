picture-tab-chars is a variable defined in `picture.el'.<br/>Its value is "!-~"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A character set which controls behavior of commands.<br/>M-x picture-set-tab-stops and M-x picture-tab-search.<br/>The syntax for this variable is like the syntax used inside of `[...]'<br/>in a regular expression--but without the `[' and the `]'.<br/>It is NOT a regular expression, any regexp special characters will be quoted.<br/>It defines a set of "interesting characters" to look for when setting<br/>(or searching for) tab stops, initially "!-~" (all printing characters).<br/>For example, suppose that you are editing a table which is formatted thus:<br/>| foo		| bar + baz | 23  *<br/>| bubbles	| and + etc | 97  *<br/>and that `picture-tab-chars' is "|+*".  Then invoking<br/>M-x picture-set-tab-stops on either of the previous lines would result<br/>in the following tab stops<br/>		:     :     :     :<br/>Another example - "A-Za-z0-9" would produce the tab stops<br/>  :		  :	:     :<br/><br/>Note that if you want the character `-' to be in the set, it must be<br/>included in a range or else appear in a context where it cannot be<br/>taken for indicating a range (e.g. "-A-Z" declares the set to be the<br/>letters `A' through `Z' and the character `-').  If you want the<br/>character `\' in the set it must be preceded by itself: "\\".<br/><br/>The command M-x picture-tab-search is defined to move beneath (or to) a<br/>character belonging to this set independent of the tab stops list.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
