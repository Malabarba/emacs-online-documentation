Its value is <pre>"!-~"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A character set which controls behavior of commands.</br>
M-x picture-set-tab-stops and M-x picture-tab-search.</br>
The syntax for this variable is like the syntax used inside of `[...]'</br>
in a regular expression--but without the `[' and the `]'.</br>
It is NOT a regular expression, any regexp special characters will be quoted.</br>
It defines a set of "interesting characters" to look for when setting</br>
(or searching for) tab stops, initially "!-~" (all printing characters).</br>
For example, suppose that you are editing a table which is formatted thus:</br>
| foo		| bar + baz | 23  *</br>
| bubbles	| and + etc | 97  *</br>
and that `picture-tab-chars' is "|+*".  Then invoking</br>
M-x picture-set-tab-stops on either of the previous lines would result</br>
in the following tab stops</br>
		:     :     :     :</br>
Another example - "A-Za-z0-9" would produce the tab stops</br>
  :		  :	:     :</br>
</br>
Note that if you want the character `-' to be in the set, it must be</br>
included in a range or else appear in a context where it cannot be</br>
taken for indicating a range (e.g. "-A-Z" declares the set to be the</br>
letters `A' through `Z' and the character `-').  If you want the</br>
character `\' in the set it must be preceded by itself: "\\".</br>
</br>
The command M-x picture-tab-search is defined to move beneath (or to) a</br>
character belonging to this set independent of the tab stops list.</br>
