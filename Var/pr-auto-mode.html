<strong>pr-auto-mode</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>printing.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means major-mode specific printing is preferred over normal printing.<br/>
<br/>
That is, if current major-mode is declared in `pr-mode-alist', the `*-buffer*'<br/>
and `*-region*' commands will behave like `*-mode*' commands; otherwise,<br/>
`*-buffer*' commands will print the current buffer and `*-region*' commands<br/>
will print the current region.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
