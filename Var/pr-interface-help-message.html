"printing.el version 6.9.3    ps-print.el version 7.3.5\n\n\nThe printing interface buffer has the same functionality as the printing menu.\nThe major difference is that the states (like sending PostScript generated to a\nfile, n-up printing, etc.) are set and saved between printing buffer\nactivation.  Also, the landscape, duplex and tumble values are the same for\nPostScript file and directory/buffer/region/mode processing; using menu, there\nare different value sets for PostScript file and directory/buffer/region/mode\nprocessing.\n\nThe printing interface buffer has the following sections:\n\n1. Print:\n\n   Here you can choose to print/preview a buffer, a directory or a PostScript\n   file:\n\n   1a. Buffer:\n\n      * Buffer List:\n	 Select a buffer from the current buffer list.\n\n      * Region:\n	 If it's on, this means that the selected buffer has an active region,\n	 so you can turn on/off, as you wish.\n	 If it's off when a buffer is selected, this means that the selected\n	 buffer has no active region, so it'll not be possible to turn it on.\n	 If you want to process the region, let this option on.\n	 If you want to process the whole buffer, let this option off.\n\n      * Mode:\n	 If it's on, this means that the selected buffer major mode is declared\n	 for major mode processing, so you can turn on/off, as you wish.\n	 If it's off when a buffer is selected, this means that the selected\n	 buffer major mode isn't declared for major mode processing, so it'll\n	 not be possible to turn it on.\n	 If you want the major mode processing, let this option on.\n	 If you don't want the major mode processing, let this option off.\n\n      NOTE 1: It's possible to customize a major mode printing, just declare\n	      the customization in `pr-mode-alist' and invoke some of\n	      `*-mode*' commands or select Mode option in Printing menu.  An\n	      example for major mode usage is when you're using gnus (or mh,\n	      or rmail, etc.) and you're in the *Summary* buffer, if you\n	      forget to switch to the *Article* buffer before printing,\n	      you'll get a nicely formatted list of article subjects shows\n	      up at the printer.  With major mode printing you don't need to\n	      switch from gnus *Summary* buffer first.\n\n   1b. Directory:\n\n      * Directory:\n	 Specify a valid directory path.\n\n      * File Regexp:\n	 Specify a file name regexp.  All file names in the directory that\n	 match with regexp will be printed/previewed.  An empty file name\n	 regexp means to print/preview all files in the directory.\n\n      * List Directory Entry:\n	 If it's turned on, list directory entries besides file entries.\n\n   1c. PostScript file:\n\n      * PostScript File:\n	 Specify an existent PostScript file to print/preview.\n\n      * PostScript Utility:\n	 Select a PostScript utility.\n	 See `pr-ps-utility-alist' and `pr-setting-database' for documentation.\n\n      NOTE 2: Don't forget to download and install the utilities declared on\n	      `pr-ps-utility-alist'.\n\n      * No Preprocessing:\n	 If it's turned on, don't use the PostScript utility to preprocess the\n	 PostScript file before printing/previewing.\n\n2. PostScript printer:\n\n   * PostScript Printer:\n      You can select a new PostScript printer to send PostScript code\n      generated.  For selection it's used all PostScript printers defined\n      in `pr-ps-printer-alist' variable (see it for documentation).\n      See also `pr-setting-database'.\n\n   * Despool:\n      If spooling is on, you can turn it on/off, as you wish.\n      If spooling is off, it'll not be possible to turn it on.\n      If it's turned on, specify to despools the PostScript spooling buffer in\n      a temporary file or in the selected PostScript file when\n      printing/previewing.\n\n   * Preview:\n      Preview the PostScript generated.\n\n   * Print:\n      Print the PostScript generated.\n\n   * Quit:\n      Quit from printing interface buffer.\n\n   * Send to Printer/Temporary File:\n      If it's turned on, the PostScript generated is sent directly to\n      PostScript printer or, for previewing, to a temporary file.\n\n   * Send to File:\n      Specify a file name to send the PostScript generated.\n\n   * N-Up:\n      Specify n-up printing.\n\n3. Text printer:\n\n   * Text Printer:\n      Select a new text printer to send text generated.  For selection it's used\n      all text printers defined in `pr-txt-printer-alist' variable (see it for\n      documentation).  See also `pr-setting-database'.\n\n   * Printify:\n      If you have control characters (character code from \\000 to \\037) in a\n      buffer and you want to print them in a text printer, select this\n      option.  All control characters in your buffer or region will be\n      replaced by a printable representation.  The printable representations\n      use ^ (for ASCII control characters) or hex.  The characters tab,\n      linefeed, space, return and formfeed are not affected.\n      You don't need to select this option if you use any option of section\n      I, the PostScript engine treats control characters properly.\n\n   * Print:\n      To print a directory, buffer, region or major mode in a\n      text printer, select this option.  See also the NOTE 1 on section 1.\n\n   * Quit:\n      Quit from printing interface buffer.\n\n4. Settings:\n\n   There are 3 setting columns:\n\n   4a. First column (left column):\n\n      * Landscape:\n	 PostScript landscape printing.\n\n      * Print Header:\n	 To have a header in each page in your PostScript code.\n\n      * Print Header Frame:\n	 To draw a gaudy frame around the header.\n\n      * Line Number:\n	 The line number is printed in your PostScript code.\n\n      * Zebra Stripes:\n	 Background zebra stripes in your PostScript code.\n\n      * Duplex:\n	 Duplex printing (if your PostScript printer has this feature).\n\n      * Tumble:\n	 If duplex printing is on, you can choose if you want to have a\n	 printing suitable for binding on the left or right (tumble off), or to\n	 have a printing suitable for binding at top or bottom (tumble on).\n\n      * Upside-Down:\n	 PostScript upside-down printing.\n\n   4b. Second column (middle column):\n\n      * Auto Region:\n	 If you want that region is automagically detected, turn on this\n	 option.  Note that this will only work if you're using transient mark\n	 mode.  When this option is on, the `*-buffer*' commands will behave\n	 like `*-region*' commands, that is, `*-buffer*' commands will print\n	 only the region marked instead of all buffer.\n\n      * Auto Mode:\n	 Turn this option on if you want that when current major-mode is\n	 declared in `pr-mode-alist', the `*-buffer*' and `*-region*' commands\n	 behave like `*-mode*' commands.\n\n      * Menu Lock:\n	 If you want that Printing menu stays open while you are setting\n	 toggle options, turn on this option.  The variables\n	 `pr-menu-char-height' and `pr-menu-char-width' are used to guess the\n	 menu position, so don't forget to adjust these variables if menu\n	 position is not ok.\n\n      * Spool Buffer:\n	 To spool the PostScript code generated.  You can despool later by\n	 setting Despool option on PostScript printer section.\n\n      * Print with faces:\n	 If you use colors in your buffers and want to see these colors on your\n	 PostScript code generated, turn on this option.  If you have a\n	 black/white PostScript printer, these colors are displayed in gray\n	 scale by PostScript printer interpreter.\n\n      * Print via Ghostscript:\n	 If you don't have a PostScript printer to send PostScript files, turn\n	 on this option.  When this option is on, the ghostscript is used to\n	 print PostScript files.  In GNU or Unix system, if ghostscript is set\n	 as a PostScript filter, you don't need to turn on this option.\n\n      * Parity Page Menu:\n	 To print all pages, odd pages, even pages, odd sheets or even sheets.\n	 See also `ps-even-or-odd-pages'.\n\n   4c. Third column (right column):\n\n      * Verbose:\n	 That is, to be verbose when editing a field in interface buffer.\n\n5. Customize:\n\n   Besides all options in section 4, you can customize much more PostScript\n   options in `ps-print' option.  Or you can customize some `lpr' options for\n   text printing.  Or customize `printing' options.\n\n6. Show settings:\n\n   Show current settings for `printing', `ps-print' or `lpr'.\n\n7. Help:\n\n   Quick help for printing interface buffer and printing menu layout.  You can\n   also quit the printing interface buffer or kill all printing help buffer.\n"</pre></br>
