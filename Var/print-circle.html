Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

Non-nil means print recursive structures using #N= and #N# syntax.</br>
If nil, printing proceeds recursively and may lead to</br>
`max-lisp-eval-depth' being exceeded or an error may occur:</br>
"Apparently circular structure being printed."  Also see</br>
`print-length' and `print-level'.</br>
If non-nil, shared substructures anywhere in the structure are printed</br>
with `#N=' before the first occurrence (in the order of the print</br>
representation) and `#N#' in place of each subsequent occurrence,</br>
where N is a positive decimal integer.
