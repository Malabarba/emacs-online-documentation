Non-nil means print uninterned symbols so they will read as uninterned.</br>
I.e., the value of (make-symbol "foobar") prints as #:foobar.</br>
When the uninterned symbol appears within a recursive data structure,</br>
and the symbol appears more than once, in addition use the #N# and #N=</br>
constructs as needed, so that multiple references to the same symbol are</br>
shared once again when the text is read back.
