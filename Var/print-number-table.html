<strong>print-number-table</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A vector used internally to produce `#N=' labels and `#N#' references.</br>
The Lisp printer uses this vector to detect Lisp objects referenced more</br>
than once.</br>
</br>
When you bind `print-continuous-numbering' to t, you should probably</br>
also bind `print-number-table' to nil.  This ensures that the value of</br>
`print-number-table' can be garbage-collected once the printing is</br>
done.  If all elements of `print-number-table' are nil, it means that</br>
the printing done so far has not found any shared structure or objects</br>
that need to be recorded in the table.
