print-number-table is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A vector used internally to produce `#N=' labels and `#N#' references.<br/>The Lisp printer uses this vector to detect Lisp objects referenced more<br/>than once.<br/><br/>When you bind `print-continuous-numbering' to t, you should probably<br/>also bind `print-number-table' to nil.  This ensures that the value of<br/>`print-number-table' can be garbage-collected once the printing is<br/>done.  If all elements of `print-number-table' are nil, it means that<br/>the printing done so far has not found any shared structure or objects<br/>that need to be recorded in the table.
