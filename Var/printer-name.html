<strong>printer-name</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>lpr.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The name of a local printer to which data is sent for printing.<br/>
(Note that PostScript files are sent to `ps-printer-name', which see.)<br/>
<br/>
On Unix-like systems, a string value should be a name understood by<br/>
lpr's -P option; otherwise the value should be nil.<br/>
<br/>
On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, a string value is taken as the name of<br/>
a printer device or port, provided `lpr-command' is set to "".<br/>
Typical non-default settings would be "LPT1" to "LPT3" for parallel<br/>
printers, or "COM1" to "COM4" or "AUX" for serial printers, or<br/>
"//hostname/printer" for a shared network printer.  You can also set<br/>
it to the name of a file, in which case the output gets appended to that<br/>
file.  If you want to discard the printed output, set this to "NUL".<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
