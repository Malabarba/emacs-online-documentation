Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, improve receive buffering by delaying after short reads.</br>
On some systems, when Emacs reads the output from a subprocess, the output data</br>
is read in very small blocks, potentially resulting in very poor performance.</br>
This behavior can be remedied to some extent by setting this variable to a</br>
non-nil value, as it will automatically delay reading from such processes, to</br>
allow them to produce more output before Emacs tries to read it.</br>
If the value is t, the delay is reset after each write to the process; any other</br>
non-nil value means that the delay is not reset on write.</br>
The variable takes effect when `start-process' is called.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
