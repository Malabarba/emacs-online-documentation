Documentation:<br/>
Whether a call of `process-file' changes remote files.<br/>
<br/>
By default, this variable is always set to `t', meaning that a<br/>
call of `process-file' could potentially change any file on a<br/>
remote host.  When set to `nil', a file handler could optimize<br/>
its behavior with respect to remote file attribute caching.<br/>
<br/>
You should only ever change this variable with a let-binding;<br/>
never with `setq'.
