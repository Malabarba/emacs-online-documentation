Legal values:</br>
'beg-of-line   - starts parsing at the beginning of a line, unless the</br>
                 previous line ends with a backslash.  Fast, but has</br>
                 problems detecting multiline /* */ comments.</br>

                 Slow, but copes better with /* */ comments.</br>
</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
