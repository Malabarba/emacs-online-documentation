<strong>ps-build-face-reference</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means build the reference face lists.</br>
</br>
ps-print sets this value to nil after it builds its internal reference lists of</br>
bold and italic faces.  By setting its value back to t, you can force ps-print</br>
to rebuild the lists the next time you invoke one of the ...-with-faces</br>
commands.</br>
</br>
You should set this value back to t after you change the attributes of any</br>
face, or create new faces.  Most users shouldn't have to worry about its</br>
setting, though.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 20 of Emacs.
