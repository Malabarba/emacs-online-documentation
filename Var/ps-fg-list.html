Specify foreground color list.</br>
</br>
This list is used to chose a text foreground color which is different than the</br>
background color.  It'll be used the first foreground color in `ps-fg-list'</br>
which is different from the background color.</br>
</br>
If this list is nil, the default foreground color is used.  See</br>
`ps-default-fg'.</br>
</br>
The list element valid values are:</br>
</br>
   NUMBER	It's a real value between 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white) that</br>
		indicate the gray color.</br>
</br>
   COLOR-NAME	It's a string which contains the color name.  For example:</br>
		"yellow".</br>
</br>
   LIST		It's a list of RGB values, that is a list of three real values</br>
		of the form:</br>
</br>
		  (RED GREEN BLUE)</br>
</br>
		Where RED, GREEN and BLUE are reals between 0.0 (no color) and</br>
		1.0 (full color).</br>
</br>
Any other value is ignored and black color will be used.</br>
</br>
This variable is used only when `ps-fg-validate-p' (which see) is non-nil and</br>
when `ps-print-color-p' (which see) is neither nil nor black-white.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
