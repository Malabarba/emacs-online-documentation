Documentation:<br/>
The items to display (each on a line) on the left part of the page header.<br/>
This applies to generating PostScript.<br/>
<br/>
The value should be a list of strings and symbols, each representing an entry<br/>
in the PostScript array HeaderLinesLeft.<br/>
<br/>
Strings are inserted unchanged into the array; those representing<br/>
PostScript string literals should be delimited with PostScript string<br/>
delimiters '(' and ')'.<br/>
<br/>
For symbols with bound functions, the function is called and should return a<br/>
string to be inserted into the array.  For symbols with bound values, the value<br/>
should be a string to be inserted into the array.  In either case, function or<br/>
variable, the string value has PostScript string delimiters added to it.<br/>
<br/>
If symbols are unbounded, they are silently ignored.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
