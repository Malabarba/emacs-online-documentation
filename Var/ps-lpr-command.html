<br/>
On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, if the value is an empty string then Emacs<br/>
will write directly to the printer port named by `ps-printer-name'.  The<br/>
programs `print' and `nprint' (the standard print programs on Windows NT and<br/>
Novell Netware respectively) are handled specially, using `ps-printer-name' as<br/>
the destination for output; any other program is treated like `lpr' except that<br/>
an explicit filename is given as the last argument.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 20 of Emacs.<br/>
