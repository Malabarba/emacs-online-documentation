<strong>ps-print-background-image</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
EPS image list to be printed on background.<br/>
<br/>
The elements are:<br/>
<br/>
   (FILENAME X Y XSCALE YSCALE ROTATION PAGES...)<br/>
<br/>
FILENAME is a file name which contains an EPS image or some PostScript<br/>
programming like EPS.<br/>
FILENAME is ignored, if it doesn't exist or is read protected.<br/>
<br/>
X and Y are relative positions on paper to put the image.<br/>
If X and Y are nil, the image is centered on paper.<br/>
<br/>
XSCALE and YSCALE are scale factor to be applied to image before printing.<br/>
If XSCALE and YSCALE are nil, the original size is used.<br/>
<br/>
ROTATION is the image rotation angle; if nil, the default is 0.<br/>
<br/>
PAGES designates the page to print background image.<br/>
PAGES may be a number or a cons cell (FROM . TO) designating FROM page to TO<br/>
page.<br/>
If PAGES is nil, print background image on all pages.<br/>
<br/>
X, Y, XSCALE, YSCALE and ROTATION may be a floating point number, an integer<br/>
number or a string.  If it is a string, the string should contain PostScript<br/>
programming that returns a float or integer value.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you wish to print an EPS image on all pages do:<br/>
<br/>
   '(("~/images/EPS-image.ps"))<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
