<strong>ps-print-prologue-header</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>

Documentation:<br/>
PostScript prologue header comments besides that ps-print generates.<br/>
<br/>
`ps-print-prologue-header' may be a string or a symbol function which returns a<br/>
string.  Note that this string is inserted on PostScript prologue header<br/>
section which is used to define some document characteristic through PostScript<br/>
special comments, like "%%Requirements: jog\n".<br/>
<br/>
ps-print always inserts the %%Requirements: comment, so if you need to insert<br/>
more requirements put them first in `ps-print-prologue-header' using the<br/>
"%%+" comment.  For example, if you need to set numcopies to 3 and jog on<br/>
requirements and set %%LanguageLevel: to 2, do:<br/>
<br/>
 (setq ps-print-prologue-header<br/>
       "%%+ numcopies(3) jog\n%%LanguageLevel: 2\n")<br/>
<br/>
The duplex requirement is inserted by ps-print (see `ps-spool-duplex').<br/>
<br/>
Do not forget to terminate the string with "\n".<br/>
