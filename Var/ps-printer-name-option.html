"-P"; if `lp' is in use, this should be the string "-d".<br/>
<br/>
On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, if `print' is in use, this should be<br/>
the string "/D:".<br/>

Set this to "" or nil, if the utility given by `ps-lpr-command'<br/>
needs an empty printer name option--that is, pass the printer name<br/>
with no special option preceding it.<br/>

Any value that is not a string is treated as nil.<br/>

This variable is used only when `ps-printer-name' is a non-empty string.<br/>

You can customize this variable.<br/>
