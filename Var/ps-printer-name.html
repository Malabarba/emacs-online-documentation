<strong>ps-printer-name</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>ps-print.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The name of a local printer for printing PostScript files.</br>
</br>
On Unix-like systems, a string value should be a name understood by lpr's -P</br>
option; a value of nil means use the value of `printer-name' instead.</br>
</br>
On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, a string value is taken as the name of the</br>
printer device or port to which PostScript files are written, provided</br>
`ps-lpr-command' is "".  By default it is the same as `printer-name'; typical</br>
non-default settings would be "LPT1" to "LPT3" for parallel printers, or</br>
"COM1" to "COM4" or "AUX" for serial printers, or "\\hostname\printer"</br>
for a shared network printer.  You can also set it to a name of a file, in</br>
which case the output gets appended to that file.  (Note that `ps-print'</br>
package already has facilities for printing to a file, so you might as well use</br>
them instead of changing the setting of this variable.)  If you want to</br>
silently discard the printed output, set this to "NUL".</br>
</br>
Set to t, if the utility given by `ps-lpr-command' needs an empty printer name.</br>
</br>
Any other value is treated as t, that is, an empty printer name.</br>
</br>
See also `ps-printer-name-option' for documentation.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 20 of Emacs.
