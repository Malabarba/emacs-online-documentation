Documentation:<br/>
Variable used to indicate the region that ps-print is printing.<br/>
It is a cons, the car of which is the line number where the region begins, and<br/>
its cdr is the total number of lines in the buffer.  Formatting functions can<br/>
use this information to print the original line number (and not the number of<br/>
lines printed), and to indicate in the header that the printout is of a partial<br/>
file.
