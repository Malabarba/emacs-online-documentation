ps-selected-pages is a variable defined in `ps-print.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Specify which pages to print.<br/><br/>If nil, print all pages.<br/><br/>If a list, the lists element may be an integer or a cons cell (FROM . TO)<br/>designating FROM page to TO page; any invalid element is ignored, that is, an<br/>integer lesser than one or if FROM is greater than TO.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's treated as nil.<br/><br/>After ps-print processing `ps-selected-pages' is set to nil.  But the<br/>latest `ps-selected-pages' is saved in `ps-last-selected-pages' (which<br/>see).  So you can restore the latest selected pages by using<br/>`ps-last-selected-pages' or with the `ps-restore-selected-pages'<br/>command (which see).<br/><br/>See also `ps-even-or-odd-pages'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 20 of Emacs.<br/>
