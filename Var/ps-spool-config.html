Its value is <pre>lpr-switches</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Specify who is responsible for setting duplex and page size.</br>
</br>
Valid values are:</br>
</br>
  `lpr-switches'    duplex and page size are configured by `ps-lpr-switches'.</br>
		    Don't forget to set `ps-lpr-switches' to select duplex</br>
		    printing for your printer.</br>
</br>
  `setpagedevice'   duplex and page size are configured by ps-print using the</br>
		    setpagedevice PostScript operator.</br>
</br>
  nil               duplex and page size are configured by ps-print *not* using</br>
		    the setpagedevice PostScript operator.</br>
</br>
Any other value is treated as nil.</br>
</br>
WARNING: The setpagedevice PostScript operator affects ghostview utility when</br>
	 viewing file generated using landscape.  Also on some printers,</br>
	 setpagedevice affects zebra stripes; on other printers, setpagedevice</br>
	 affects the left margin.</br>
	 Besides all that, if your printer does not have the paper size</br>
	 specified by setpagedevice, your printing will be aborted.</br>
	 So, if you need to use setpagedevice, set `ps-spool-config' to</br>
	 `setpagedevice', generate a test file and send it to your printer; if</br>
	 the printed file isn't OK, set `ps-spool-config' to nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
