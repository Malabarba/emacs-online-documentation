Non-nil generates PostScript for a two-sided printer.</br>
For a duplex printer, the `ps-spool-*' and `ps-print-*' commands will insert</br>
blank pages as needed between print jobs so that the next buffer printed will</br>
start on the right page.  Also, if headers are turned on, the headers will be</br>
reversed on duplex printers so that the page numbers fall to the left on</br>
even-numbered pages.</br>
</br>
See also `ps-spool-tumble'.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 20 of Emacs.
