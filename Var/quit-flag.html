<strong>quit-flag</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil causes `eval' to abort, unless `inhibit-quit' is non-nil.</br>
If the value is t, that means do an ordinary quit.</br>
If the value equals `throw-on-input', that means quit by throwing</br>
to the tag specified in `throw-on-input'; it's for handling `while-no-input'.</br>
Typing C-g sets `quit-flag' to t, regardless of `inhibit-quit',</br>
but `inhibit-quit' non-nil prevents anything from taking notice of that.
