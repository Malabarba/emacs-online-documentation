quit-flag is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil causes `eval' to abort, unless `inhibit-quit' is non-nil.<br/>If the value is t, that means do an ordinary quit.<br/>If the value equals `throw-on-input', that means quit by throwing<br/>to the tag specified in `throw-on-input'; it's for handling `while-no-input'.<br/>Typing C-g sets `quit-flag' to t, regardless of `inhibit-quit',<br/>but `inhibit-quit' non-nil prevents anything from taking notice of that.
