<strong>r2b-booktitle-abbrevs</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>refbib.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Abbreviation list for book and proceedings names.<br/>
If the car of an element matches a title or booktitle exactly, it is<br/>
replaced by the cadr when output.  Braces must be included if<br/>
replacement is a {string}, but not if replacement is a bibtex<br/>
abbreviation.  The cadr may be eliminated if is exactly the same as<br/>
the car.<br/>
  Because titles are capitalized before matching, the abbreviated title<br/>
should be listed as beginning with a capital letter, even if it doesn't.<br/>
  For example, a value of '(("Aij" "{Artificial Intelligence}")<br/>
("Ijcai81" "ijcai7")) would expand Aij to the text string<br/>
"Artificial Intelligence", but would replace Ijcai81 with the<br/>
BibTeX macro "ijcai7".<br/>
