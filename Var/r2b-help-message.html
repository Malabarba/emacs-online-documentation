r2b-help-message is a variable defined in `refbib.el'.<br/>Its value is<br/>"                   Refer to Bibtex Bibliography Conversion\n\nA refer-style database is of the form:\n\n%A Joe Blow\n%T Great Thoughts I've Thought\n%D 1977\netc.\n\nThis utility converts these kind of databases to bibtex form, for\nusers of TeX and LaTex.  Instructions:\n1.  Visit the file containing the refer-style database.\n2.  The command\n	M-x r2b-convert-buffer\n    converts the entire buffer, appending its output by default in a\n    buffer named *Out*, and logging progress and errors in a buffer\n    named *Log*.  The original file is never modified.\n	Note that results are appended to *Out*, so if that buffer\n	buffer already exists and contains material you don't want to\n 	save, you should kill it first.\n3.  Switch to the buffer *Out* and save it as a named file.\n4.  To convert a single refer-style entry, simply position the cursor\n    at the entry and enter\n	M-x r2b-convert-record\n    Again output is appended to *Out* and errors are logged in *Log*.\n\nThis utility is very robust and pretty smart about determining the\ntype of the entry.  It includes facilities for expanding refer macros\nto text, or substituting bibtex macros.  Do M-x describe-variable on\n     r2b-journal-abbrevs\n     r2b-booktitle-abbrevs\n     r2b-proceedings-list\nfor information on these features.\n\nPlease send bug reports and suggestions to\n	Henry Kautz\n        kautz@research.att.com\n	allegra!kautz"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Not documented as a variable.
