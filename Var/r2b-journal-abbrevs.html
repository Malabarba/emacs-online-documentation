r2b-journal-abbrevs is a variable defined in `refbib.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Abbreviation list for journal names.<br/>If the car of an element matches a journal name exactly, it is replaced by<br/>the cadr when output.  Braces must be included if replacement is a<br/>{string}, but not if replacement is a bibtex abbreviation.  The cadr<br/>may be eliminated if is exactly the same as the car.<br/>  Because titles are capitalized before matching, the abbreviation<br/>for the journal name should be listed as beginning with a capital<br/>letter, even if it really doesn't.<br/>  For example, a value of '(("Aij" "{Artificial Intelligence}")<br/>("Ijcai81" "ijcai7")) would expand Aij to the text string<br/>"Artificial Intelligence", but would replace Ijcai81 with the<br/>BibTeX macro "ijcai7".<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
