<strong>r2b-journal-abbrevs</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>refbib.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Abbreviation list for journal names.</br>
If the car of an element matches a journal name exactly, it is replaced by</br>
the cadr when output.  Braces must be included if replacement is a</br>
{string}, but not if replacement is a bibtex abbreviation.  The cadr</br>
may be eliminated if is exactly the same as the car.</br>
  Because titles are capitalized before matching, the abbreviation</br>
for the journal name should be listed as beginning with a capital</br>
letter, even if it really doesn't.</br>
  For example, a value of '(("Aij" "{Artificial Intelligence}")</br>
("Ijcai81" "ijcai7")) would expand Aij to the text string</br>
"Artificial Intelligence", but would replace Ijcai81 with the</br>
BibTeX macro "ijcai7".</br>

You can customize this variable.
