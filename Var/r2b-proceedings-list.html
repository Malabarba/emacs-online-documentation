<strong>r2b-proceedings-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>refbib.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Assoc list of books or journals which are really conference proceedings,</br>
but whose name and whose abbrev expansion (as defined in `r2b-journal-abbrevs'</br>
and `r2b-booktitle-abbrevs') does not contain the words "conference" or</br>
"proceedings".  (Those cases are handled automatically.)</br>
The entry must match the given data exactly.</br>
  Because titles are capitalized before matching, the items in this list</br>
should begin with a capital letter.</br>
  For example, suppose the title "Ijcai81" is used for the proceedings of</br>
a conference, and its expansion is the BibTeX macro "ijcai7".  Then</br>
`r2b-proceedings-list' should be '(("Ijcai81") ...).  If instead its</br>
expansion were "Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference</br>
on Artificial Intelligence", then you would NOT need to include Ijcai81</br>
in `r2b-proceedings-list' (although it wouldn't cause an error).</br>
