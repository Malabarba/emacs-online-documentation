<strong>read-symbol-positions-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A list mapping read symbols to their positions.</br>
This variable is modified during calls to `read' or</br>
`read-from-string', but only when `read-with-symbol-positions' is</br>
non-nil.</br>
</br>
Each element of the list looks like (SYMBOL . CHAR-POSITION), where</br>
CHAR-POSITION is an integer giving the offset of that occurrence of the</br>
symbol from the position where `read' or `read-from-string' started.</br>
</br>
Note that a symbol will appear multiple times in this list, if it was</br>
read multiple times.  The list is in the same order as the symbols</br>
were read in.
