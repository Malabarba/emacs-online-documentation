<strong>read-with-symbol-positions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, add position of read symbols to `read-symbol-positions-list'.</br>
</br>
If this variable is a buffer, then only forms read from that buffer</br>
will be added to `read-symbol-positions-list'.</br>
If this variable is t, then all read forms will be added.</br>
The effect of all other values other than nil are not currently</br>
defined, although they may be in the future.</br>
</br>
The positions are relative to the last call to `read' or</br>
`read-from-string'.  It is probably a bad idea to set this variable at</br>
the toplevel; bind it instead.
