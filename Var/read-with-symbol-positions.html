read-with-symbol-positions is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, add position of read symbols to `read-symbol-positions-list'.<br/><br/>If this variable is a buffer, then only forms read from that buffer<br/>will be added to `read-symbol-positions-list'.<br/>If this variable is t, then all read forms will be added.<br/>The effect of all other values other than nil are not currently<br/>defined, although they may be in the future.<br/><br/>The positions are relative to the last call to `read' or<br/>`read-from-string'.  It is probably a bad idea to set this variable at<br/>the toplevel; bind it instead.
