<strong>recentf-keep</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>recentf.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is (recentf-keep-default-predicate)<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of regexps and predicates for filenames kept in the recent list.<br/>
Regexps and predicates are tried in the specified order.<br/>
When nil all filenames are kept in the recent list.<br/>
When a filename matches any of the regexps or satisfies any of the<br/>
predicates it is kept in the recent list.<br/>
The default is to keep readable files.  Remote files are checked<br/>
for readability only in case a connection is established to that<br/>
remote system, otherwise they are kept in the recent list without<br/>
checking their readability.<br/>
A predicate is a function that is passed a filename to check and that<br/>
must return non-nil to keep it.<br/>
