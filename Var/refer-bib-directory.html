Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Directory, or list of directories, to search for \.bib files.</br>
Can be set to 'bibinputs or 'texinputs, in which case the environment</br>
variable BIBINPUTS or TEXINPUTS, respectively, is used to obtain a</br>
list of directories.  Useful only if `refer-bib-files' is set to 'dir or</br>
a list of file names (without directory).  A value of nil indicates the</br>
current working directory.</br>
</br>
If `refer-bib-directory' is 'bibinputs or 'texinputs, it is setq'd to</br>
the appropriate list of directories when it is first used.</br>
</br>
Note that an empty directory is interpreted by BibTeX as indicating</br>
the default search path.  Since Refer does not know that default path,</br>
it cannot search it.  Include that path explicitly in your BIBINPUTS</br>
environment if you really want it searched (which is not likely to</br>
happen anyway).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
