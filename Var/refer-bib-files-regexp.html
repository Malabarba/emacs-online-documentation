<strong>refer-bib-files-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>refer.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "\\\\bibliography"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp matching a bibliography file declaration.<br/>
The current buffer is expected to contain a line such as<br/>
\bibliography{file1,file2,file3}<br/>
which is read to set up `refer-bib-files'.  The regexp must specify the command<br/>
(such as \bibliography) that is used to specify the list of bib files.  The<br/>
command is expected to specify a file name, or a list of comma-separated file<br/>
names, within curly braces.<br/>
If a specified file doesn't exist and has no extension, a \.bib extension<br/>
is automatically tried.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
