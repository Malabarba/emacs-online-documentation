<strong>refer-bib-files</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>refer.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is dir<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of \.bib files to search for references,<br/>
or one of the following special values:<br/>
nil  = prompt for \.bib file (if visiting a \.bib file, use it as default)<br/>
auto = read \.bib file names from appropriate command in buffer (see<br/>
       `refer-bib-files-regexp') unless the buffer's mode is `bibtex-mode',<br/>
       in which case only the buffer is searched<br/>
dir  = use all \.bib files in directories referenced by `refer-bib-directory'.<br/>
<br/>
If a specified file doesn't exist and has no extension, a \.bib extension<br/>
is automatically tried.<br/>
<br/>
If `refer-bib-files' is nil, auto or dir, it is setq'd to the appropriate<br/>
list of files when it is first used if `refer-cache-bib-files' is t.  If<br/>
`refer-cache-bib-files' is nil, the list of \.bib files to use is re-read<br/>
each time it is needed.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
