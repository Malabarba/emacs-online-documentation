Non-nil tells `refill-post-command-function' to do its processing.</br>
Set by `refill-after-change-function' in `after-change-functions' and</br>
unset by `refill-post-command-function' in `post-command-hook', and</br>
sometimes `refill-pre-command-function' in `pre-command-hook'.  This</br>
ensures refilling is only done once per command that causes a change,</br>
regardless of the number of after-change calls from commands doing</br>
complex processing.
