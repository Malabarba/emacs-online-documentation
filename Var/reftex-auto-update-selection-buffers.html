<strong>reftex-auto-update-selection-buffers</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, selection buffers will be updated automatically.</br>
When a new label is defined with `reftex-label', all selection buffers</br>
associated with that label category are emptied, in order to force an</br>
update upon next use.  When nil, the buffers are left alone and have to be</br>
updated by hand, with the `g' key from the label selection process.</br>
The value of this variable will only have any effect when</br>
`reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers' is non-nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
