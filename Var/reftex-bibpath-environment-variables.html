<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of specifications how to retrieve search path for .bib database files.<br/>
Several entries are possible.<br/>
- If an element is the name of an environment variable, its content is used.<br/>
- If an element starts with an exclamation mark, it is used as a command<br/>
  to retrieve the path.  A typical command with the kpathsearch library would<br/>
  be `!kpsewhich -show-path=.bib'.<br/>
- Otherwise the element itself is interpreted as a path.<br/>
Multiple directories can be separated by the system dependent `path-separator'.<br/>
Directories ending in `//' or `!!' will be expanded recursively.<br/>
