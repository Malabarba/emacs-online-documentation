Non-nil means, re-parse only 1 file when asked to re-parse.</br>
Re-parsing is normally requested with a `C-u' prefix to many RefTeX commands,</br>
or with the `r' key in menus.  When this option is t in a multifile document,</br>
we will only parse the current buffer, or the file associated with the label</br>
or section heading near point in a menu.  Requesting re-parsing of an entire</br>
multifile document then requires a `C-u C-u' prefix or the capital `R' key</br>
in menus.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
