<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil mean, highlight selected text in selection and *toc* buffers.</br>
Normally, the text near the cursor is the selected text, and it is</br>
highlighted.  This is the entry most keys in the selection and *toc*</br>
buffers act on.  However, if you mainly use the mouse to select an</br>
item, you may find it nice to have mouse-triggered highlighting</br>
instead or as well.  The variable may have one of these values:</br>
</br>
   nil      No highlighting.</br>
   cursor   Highlighting is cursor driven.</br>
   mouse    Highlighting is mouse driven.</br>
   both     Both cursor and mouse trigger highlighting.</br>
</br>
Changing this variable requires to rebuild the selection and *toc* buffers</br>
to become effective (keys `g' or `r').</br>

You can customize this variable.
