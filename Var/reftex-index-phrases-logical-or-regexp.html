<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp matching the `or' operator for index arguments in phrases file.<br/>
When several index arguments in a phrase line are separated by this<br/>
operator, the user will be asked to select one of them at each match<br/>
of the search phrase.  The first index arg will be the default - a<br/>
number key 1-9 must be pressed to switch to another.<br/>
<br/>
Note: make sure this does no match things which are not separators.<br/>
The logical `and' specified in `reftex-index-phrases-logical-or-regexp'<br/>
has higher priority than this logical `or'.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
