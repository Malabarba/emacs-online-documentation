Non-nil means phrases search will look for whole words, not subwords.</br>
This works by requiring word boundaries at the beginning and end of</br>
the search string.  When the search phrase already has a non-word-char</br>
at one of these points, no word boundary is required there.</br>

You can customize this variable.
