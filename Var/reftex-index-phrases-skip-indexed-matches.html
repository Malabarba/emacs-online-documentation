<strong>reftex-index-phrases-skip-indexed-matches</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, skip matches which appear to be indexed already.</br>
When doing global indexing from the phrases buffer, searches for some</br>
phrases may match at places where that phrase was already indexed.  In</br>
particular when indexing an already processed document again, this</br>
will even be the norm.  When this variable is non-nil, RefTeX checks if</br>
the match is inside an index macro argument, or if an index macro is directly</br>
before or after the phrase.  If that is the case, that match will</br>
be ignored.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
