Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, when indexing from the phrases buffer, wrap lines.</br>
Inserting indexing commands in a line makes the line longer - often</br>
so long that it does not fit onto the screen.  When this variable is</br>
non-nil, newlines will be added as necessary before and/or after the</br>
indexing command to keep lines short.  However, the matched text</br>
phrase and its index command will always end up on a single line.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
