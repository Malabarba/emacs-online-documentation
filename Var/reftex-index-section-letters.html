Documentation:<br/>
The letters which denote sections in the index.<br/>
Usually these are all capital letters.  Don't use any downcase letters.<br/>
Order is not significant, the index will be sorted by whatever the sort<br/>
function thinks is correct.<br/>
In addition to these letters, RefTeX will create a group `!' which<br/>
contains all entries sorted below the lowest specified letter.<br/>
In the index buffer, pressing any of these capital letters or `!' will jump<br/>
to that section.<br/>
