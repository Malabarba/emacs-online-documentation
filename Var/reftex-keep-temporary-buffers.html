Its value is <pre>1</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, keep buffers created for parsing and lookup.</br>
RefTeX sometimes needs to visit files related to the current document.</br>
We distinguish files visited for</br>
PARSING: Parts of a multifile document loaded when (re)-parsing the document.</br>
LOOKUP:  BibTeX database files and TeX files loaded to find a reference,</br>
         to display label context, etc.</br>
The created buffers can be kept for later use, or be thrown away immediately</br>
after use, depending on the value of this variable:</br>
</br>
nil  Throw away as much as possible.</br>
t    Keep everything.</br>
1    Throw away buffers created for parsing, but keep the ones created</br>
     for lookup.</br>
</br>
If a buffer is to be kept, the file is visited normally (which is potentially</br>
slow but will happen only once).</br>
If a buffer is to be thrown away, the initialization of the buffer depends</br>
upon the variable `reftex-initialize-temporary-buffers'.</br>
</br>
