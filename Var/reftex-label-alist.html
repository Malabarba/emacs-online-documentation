<strong>reftex-label-alist</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist with information on environments for \label-\ref use.<br/>
<br/>
This doc string is easier to understand after reading the configuration<br/>
examples in the manual.  Looking at the builtin defaults in the constant<br/>
`reftex-label-alist-builtin' may also be instructive.<br/>
<br/>
Set this variable to define additions and changes to the default.  The only<br/>
things you MUST NOT change is that `?s' is the type indicator for section<br/>
labels, and SPC for the `any' label type.  These are hard-coded at other<br/>
places in the code.<br/>
<br/>
The value of the variable must be a list of items.  Each item is a list<br/>
itself and has the following structure:<br/>
<br/>
 (ENV-OR-MACRO TYPE-KEY LABEL-PREFIX REFERENCE-FORMAT CONTEXT-METHOD<br/>
           (MAGIC-WORD ... ) TOC-LEVEL)<br/>
<br/>
Each list entry describes either an environment carrying a counter for use<br/>
with \label and \ref, or a LaTeX macro defining a label as (or inside)<br/>
one of its arguments.  The elements of each list entry are:<br/>
<br/>
ENV-OR-MACRO<br/>
    Name of the environment (like "table") or macro (like "\\myfig").<br/>
    For macros, indicate the macro arguments for best results, as in<br/>
    "\\myfig[]{}{}{*}{}".  Use square brackets for optional arguments,<br/>
    a star to mark the label argument, if any.  The macro does not have to<br/>
    have a label argument - you could also use \label{..} inside one of<br/>
    its arguments.<br/>
    Special names: `section' for section labels, `any' to define a group<br/>
    which contains all labels.<br/>
<br/>
    This may also be a function to do local parsing and identify point to<br/>
    be in a non-standard label environment.  The function must take an<br/>
    argument BOUND and limit backward searches to this value.  It should<br/>
    return either nil or the position where the special environment starts.<br/>
    See the Info documentation for an example.<br/>
<br/>
    Finally this may also be nil if the entry is only meant to change<br/>
    some settings associated with the type indicator character (see below).<br/>
<br/>
TYPE-KEY<br/>
    Type indicator character, like `?t', must be a printable ASCII character.<br/>
    The type indicator is a single character which defines a label type.<br/>
    Any label inside the environment or macro is assumed to belong to this<br/>
    type.  The same character may occur several times in this list, to cover<br/>
    cases in which different environments carry the same label type (like<br/>
    `equation' and `eqnarray').<br/>
    If the type indicator is nil and the macro has a label argument {*},<br/>
    the macro defines neutral labels just like \label.  In this case<br/>
    the remainder of this entry is ignored.<br/>
<br/>
LABEL-PREFIX<br/>
    Label prefix string, like "tab:".<br/>
    The prefix is a short string used as the start of a label.  It may be the<br/>
    empty string.  The prefix may contain the following `%' escapes:<br/>
       %f   Current file name with directory and extension stripped.<br/>
       %F   Current file name relative to directory of master file.<br/>
       %m   Master file name, directory and extension stripped.<br/>
       %M   Directory name (without path) where master file is located.<br/>
       %u   User login name, on systems which support this.<br/>
       %S   A section prefix derived with variable `reftex-section-prefixes'.<br/>
<br/>
    Example: In a file `intro.tex', "eq:%f:" will become "eq:intro:").<br/>
<br/>
REFERENCE-FORMAT<br/>
    Format string for reference insertion in buffer.  `%s' will be replaced<br/>
    by the label.<br/>
    When the format starts with `~', the `~' will only be inserted if<br/>
    there is not already a whitespace before point.<br/>
<br/>
CONTEXT-METHOD<br/>
    Indication on how to find the short context.<br/>
    - If nil, use the text following the \label{...} macro.<br/>
    - If t, use<br/>
       - the section heading for section labels.<br/>
       - text following the \begin{...} statement of environments.<br/>
         (not a good choice for environments like eqnarray or enumerate,<br/>
         where one has several labels in a single environment).<br/>
       - text after the macro name (starting with the first arg) for macros.<br/>
    - If an integer, use the nth argument of the macro.  As a special case,<br/>
      1000 means to get text after the last macro argument.<br/>
    - If a string, use as regexp to search *backward* from the label.  Context<br/>
      is then the text following the end of the match.  E.g. setting this to<br/>
      "\\\\caption[[{]" will use the caption in a figure or table<br/>
      environment.<br/>
      "\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\|\\\\\\\\" works for eqnarrays.<br/>
    - If any of `caption', `item', `eqnarray-like', `alignat-like', this<br/>
      symbol will internally be translated into an appropriate regexp<br/>
      (see also the variable `reftex-default-context-regexps').<br/>
    - If a function, call this function with the name of the environment/macro<br/>
      as argument.  On call, point will be just after the \label macro.  The<br/>
      function is expected to return a suitable context string.  It should<br/>
      throw an exception (error) when failing to find context.<br/>
      As an example, here is a function returning the 10 chars following<br/>
      the label macro as context:<br/>
<br/>
        (defun my-context-function (env-or-mac)<br/>
          (if (> (point-max) (+ 10 (point)))<br/>
              (buffer-substring (point) (+ 10 (point)))<br/>
            (error "Buffer too small")))<br/>
<br/>
    Label context is used in two ways by RefTeX: For display in the label<br/>
    menu, and to derive a label string.  If you want to use a different<br/>
    method for each of these, specify them as a dotted pair.<br/>
    E.g. `(nil . t)' uses the text after the label (nil) for display, and<br/>
    text from the default position (t) to derive a label string.  This is<br/>
    actually used for section labels.<br/>
<br/>
MAGIC-WORDS<br/>
    List of magic words which identify a reference to be of this type.<br/>
    If the word before point is equal to one of these words when calling<br/>
    `reftex-reference', the label list offered will be automatically<br/>
    restricted to labels of the correct type.<br/>
    If the first element of this wordlist is the symbol `regexp', the<br/>
    strings are interpreted as regular expressions.  RefTeX will add<br/>
    a "\\W" to the beginning and other stuff to the end of the regexp.<br/>
<br/>
TOC-LEVEL<br/>
    The integer level at which this environment should be added to the<br/>
    table of contents.  See also `reftex-section-levels'.  A positive<br/>
    value will number the entries mixed with the sectioning commands of<br/>
    the same level.  A negative value will make unnumbered entries.<br/>
    Useful only for theorem-like environments, will be ignored for macros.<br/>
    When omitted or nil, no TOC entries will be made.<br/>
<br/>
If the type indicator characters of two or more entries are the same, RefTeX<br/>
will use<br/>
 - the first non-nil format and prefix<br/>
 - the magic words of all involved entries.<br/>
<br/>
Any list entry may also be a symbol.  If that has an association in<br/>
`reftex-label-alist-builtin', the cddr of that association is spliced into the<br/>
list.  However, builtin defaults should normally be set with the variable<br/>
`reftex-default-label-alist-entries'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
