reftex-label-menu-flags is a variable defined in `reftex-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is (t t nil nil nil nil t nil)<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of flags governing the label menu makeup.<br/>The flags are:<br/><br/>TABLE-OF-CONTENTS  Show the labels embedded in a table of context.<br/>SECTION-NUMBERS    Include section numbers (like 4.1.3) in table of contents.<br/>COUNTERS           Show counters.  This just numbers the labels in the menu.<br/>NO-CONTEXT         Non-nil means do NOT show the short context.<br/>FOLLOW             Follow full context in other window.<br/>SHOW-COMMENTED     Show labels from regions which are commented out.<br/>MATCH-IN-TOC       Obsolete flag.<br/>SHOW FILES         Show begin and end of included files.<br/><br/>Each of these flags can be set to t or nil, or to a string of type letters<br/>indicating the label types for which it should be true.  These strings work<br/>like character classes in regular expressions.  Thus, setting one of the<br/>flags to "sf" makes the flag true for section and figure labels, nil<br/>for everything else.  Setting it to "^sf" makes it the other way round.<br/>The available label types are: s (section), f (figure), t (table), i (item),<br/>e (equation), n (footnote), plus any definitions in `reftex-label-alist'.<br/><br/>Most options can also be switched from the label menu itself - so if you<br/>decide here to not have a table of contents in the label menu, you can still<br/>get one interactively during selection from the label menu.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
