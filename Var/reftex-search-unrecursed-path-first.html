<strong>reftex-search-unrecursed-path-first</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means, search all specified directories before trying recursion.<br/>
Thus, in a path ".//:/tex/", search first "./", then "/tex/" and then<br/>
all subdirectories of "./".  If this option is nil, the subdirectories of<br/>
"./" are searched before "/tex/".  This is mainly for speed - most of the<br/>
time the recursive path is for the system files and not for the user files.<br/>
Set this to nil if the default makes RefTeX finding files with equal names<br/>
in wrong sequence.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
