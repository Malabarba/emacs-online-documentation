<strong>reftex-section-levels</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is shown <a href="#value">below</a>.</br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Commands and levels used for defining sections in the document.</br>
This is an alist with each element like (COMMAND-NAME . LEVEL).</br>
The car of each cons cell is the name of the section macro (without</br>
the backslash).  The cdr is a number indicating its level.  A negative</br>
level means the same level as the positive value, but the section will</br>
never get a number.  The cdr may also be a function which will be called</br>
to after the section-re matched to determine the level.</br>
This list is also used for promotion and demotion of sectioning commands.</br>
If you are using a document class which has several sets of sectioning</br>
commands, promotion only works correctly if this list is sorted first</br>
by set, then within each set by level.  The promotion commands always</br>
select the nearest entry with the correct new level.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
