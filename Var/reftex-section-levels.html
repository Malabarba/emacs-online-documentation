reftex-section-levels is a variable defined in `reftex-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is shown below.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Commands and levels used for defining sections in the document.<br/>This is an alist with each element like (COMMAND-NAME . LEVEL).<br/>The car of each cons cell is the name of the section macro (without<br/>the backslash).  The cdr is a number indicating its level.  A negative<br/>level means the same level as the positive value, but the section will<br/>never get a number.  The cdr may also be a function which will be called<br/>to after the section-re matched to determine the level.<br/>This list is also used for promotion and demotion of sectioning commands.<br/>If you are using a document class which has several sets of sectioning<br/>commands, promotion only works correctly if this list is sorted first<br/>by set, then within each set by level.  The promotion commands always<br/>select the nearest entry with the correct new level.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>Value: (("part" . 0)<br/> ("chapter" . 1)<br/> ("section" . 2)<br/> ("subsection" . 3)<br/> ("subsubsection" . 4)<br/> ("paragraph" . 5)<br/> ("subparagraph" . 6)<br/> ("addchap" . -1)<br/> ("addsec" . -2))<br/><br/>
