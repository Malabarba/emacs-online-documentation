Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, index entries are parsed as well.</br>
Index support is resource intensive and the internal structure holding the</br>
parsed information can become quite big.  Therefore it can be turned off.</br>
When this is nil and you execute a command which requires index support,</br>
you will be asked for confirmation to turn it on and rescan the document.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
