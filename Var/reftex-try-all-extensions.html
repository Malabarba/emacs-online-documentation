reftex-try-all-extensions is a variable defined in `reftex-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means, try all extensions listed in `reftex-file-extensions'.<br/>When searching for a file, LaTeX uses only the default extension.  However,<br/>if you are working with a noweb system that produces the .tex files from<br/>some other file, and you want RefTeX to scan the web file instead of the<br/>tex file, you need to set this option.  You also need to make the noweb<br/>extension the default extension, i.e. the first in the list in<br/>`reftex-file-extensions'.<br/>Note that if you are using external file finders, this option has no effect.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
