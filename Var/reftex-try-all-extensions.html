<strong>reftex-try-all-extensions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means, try all extensions listed in `reftex-file-extensions'.</br>
When searching for a file, LaTeX uses only the default extension.  However,</br>
if you are working with a noweb system that produces the .tex files from</br>
some other file, and you want RefTeX to scan the web file instead of the</br>
tex file, you need to set this option.  You also need to make the noweb</br>
extension the default extension, i.e. the first in the list in</br>
`reftex-file-extensions'.</br>
Note that if you are using external file finders, this option has no effect.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
