reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers is a variable defined in `reftex-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means use a separate selection buffer for each label type.<br/>These buffers are kept from one selection to the next and need not to be<br/>created for each use - so the menu generally comes up faster.  The<br/>selection buffers will be erased (and therefore updated) automatically<br/>when new labels in its category are added.  See the variable<br/>`reftex-auto-update-selection-buffers'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
