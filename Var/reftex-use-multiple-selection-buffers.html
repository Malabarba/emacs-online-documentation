<strong>reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reftex-vars.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means use a separate selection buffer for each label type.</br>
These buffers are kept from one selection to the next and need not to be</br>
created for each use - so the menu generally comes up faster.  The</br>
selection buffers will be erased (and therefore updated) automatically</br>
when new labels in its category are added.  See the variable</br>
`reftex-auto-update-selection-buffers'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
