reftex-view-crossref-extra is a variable defined in `reftex-vars.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Macros which can be used for the display of cross references.<br/>This is used when `reftex-view-crossref' is called with point in an<br/>argument of a macro.  Note that crossref viewing for citations,<br/>references (both ways) and index entries is hard-coded.  This variable<br/>is only to configure additional structures for which cross-reference<br/>viewing can be useful.  Each entry has the structure<br/><br/>(MACRO-RE SEARCH-RE HIGHLIGHT).<br/><br/>MACRO-RE is matched against the macro.  SEARCH-RE is the regexp used<br/>to search for cross references.  `%s' in this regexp is replaced with<br/>with the macro argument at point.  HIGHLIGHT is an integer indicating<br/>which subgroup of the match should be highlighted.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
