<strong>remote-file-name-inhibit-cache</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>10</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Whether to use the remote file-name cache for read access.</br>
When `nil', never expire cached values (caution)</br>
When `t', never use the cache (safe, but may be slow)</br>
A number means use cached values for that amount of seconds since caching.</br>
</br>
The attributes of remote files are cached for better performance.</br>
If they are changed outside of Emacs's control, the cached values</br>
become invalid, and must be reread.  If you are sure that nothing</br>
other than Emacs changes the files, you can set this variable to `nil'.</br>
</br>
If a remote file is checked regularly, it might be a good idea to</br>
let-bind this variable to a value less than the interval between</br>
consecutive checks.  For example:</br>
</br>
  (defun display-time-file-nonempty-p (file)</br>
    (let ((remote-file-name-inhibit-cache (- display-time-interval 5)))</br>
      (and (file-exists-p file)</br>
           (< 0 (nth 7 (file-attributes (file-chase-links file)))))))</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
