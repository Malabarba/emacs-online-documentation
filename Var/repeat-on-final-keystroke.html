Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Allow `repeat' to re-execute for repeating lastchar of a key sequence.</br>
If this variable is t, `repeat' determines what key sequence</br>
it was invoked by, extracts the final character of that sequence, and</br>
re-executes as many times as that final character is hit; so for example</br>
if `repeat' is bound to C-x z, typing C-x z z z repeats the previous command</br>
3 times.  If this variable is a sequence of characters, then re-execution</br>
only occurs if the final character by which `repeat' was invoked is a</br>
member of that sequence.  If this variable is nil, no re-execution occurs.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
