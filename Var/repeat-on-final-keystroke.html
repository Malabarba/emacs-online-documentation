<strong>repeat-on-final-keystroke</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>repeat.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Allow `repeat' to re-execute for repeating lastchar of a key sequence.<br/>
If this variable is t, `repeat' determines what key sequence<br/>
it was invoked by, extracts the final character of that sequence, and<br/>
re-executes as many times as that final character is hit; so for example<br/>
if `repeat' is bound to C-x z, typing C-x z z z repeats the previous command<br/>
3 times.  If this variable is a sequence of characters, then re-execution<br/>
only occurs if the final character by which `repeat' was invoked is a<br/>
member of that sequence.  If this variable is nil, no re-execution occurs.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
