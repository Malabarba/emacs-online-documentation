<strong>reporter-dont-compact-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reporter.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Interface variable controlling compacting of list values.</br>
When non-nil, this must be a list of variable symbols.  When a</br>
variable containing a list value is formatted in the bug report mail</br>
buffer, it normally is compacted so that its value fits one the fewest</br>
number of lines.  If the variable's symbol appears in this list, its</br>
value is printed in a more verbose style, specifically, one elemental</br>
sexp per line.</br>
</br>
Note that this variable is not buffer-local so you should never just</br>
`setq' it.  If you want to changes its default value, you should `let'</br>
bind it.
