<strong>reporter-prompt-for-summary-p</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>reporter.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Interface variable controlling prompting for problem summary.<br/>
When non-nil, `reporter-submit-bug-report' prompts the user for a<br/>
brief summary of the problem, and puts this summary on the Subject:<br/>
line.  If this variable is a string, that string is used as the prompt<br/>
string.<br/>
<br/>
Default behavior is to not prompt (i.e. nil).  If you want reporter to<br/>
prompt, you should `let' bind this variable before calling<br/>
`reporter-submit-bug-report'.  Note that this variable is not<br/>
buffer-local so you should never just `setq' it.
