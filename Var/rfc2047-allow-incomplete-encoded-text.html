*Non-nil means allow incomplete encoded-text in successive encoded-words.</br>
Dividing of encoded-text in the place other than character boundaries</br>
violates RFC2047 section 5, while we have a capability to decode it.</br>
If it is non-nil, the decoder will decode B- or Q-encoding in each</br>
encoded-word, concatenate them, and decode it by charset.  Otherwise,</br>
the decoder will fully decode each encoded-word before concatenating</br>
them.
