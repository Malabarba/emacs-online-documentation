<strong>rlogin-directory-tracking-mode</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>rlogin.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is local<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Control whether and how to do directory tracking in an rlogin buffer.<br/>
<br/>
nil means don't do directory tracking.<br/>
<br/>
t means do so using an ftp remote file name.<br/>
<br/>
Any other value means do directory tracking using local file names.<br/>
This works only if the remote machine and the local one<br/>
share the same directories (through NFS).  This is the default.<br/>
<br/>
This variable becomes local to a buffer when set in any fashion for it.<br/>
<br/>
It is better to use the function of the same name to change the behavior of<br/>
directory tracking in an rlogin session once it has begun, rather than<br/>
simply setting this variable, since the function does the necessary<br/>
re-synching of directories.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
