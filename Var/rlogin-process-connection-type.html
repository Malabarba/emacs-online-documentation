<strong>rlogin-process-connection-type</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>rlogin.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, use a pty for the local rlogin process.</br>
If nil, use a pipe (if pipes are supported on the local system).</br>
</br>
Generally it is better not to waste ptys on systems which have a static</br>
number of them.  On the other hand, some implementations of `rlogin' assume</br>
a pty is being used, and errors will result from using a pipe instead.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
