rlogin-process-connection-type is a variable defined in `rlogin.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, use a pty for the local rlogin process.<br/>If nil, use a pipe (if pipes are supported on the local system).<br/><br/>Generally it is better not to waste ptys on systems which have a static<br/>number of them.  On the other hand, some implementations of `rlogin' assume<br/>a pty is being used, and errors will result from using a pipe instead.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
