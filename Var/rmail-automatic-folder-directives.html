rmail-automatic-folder-directives is a variable defined in `rmail.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of directives specifying how to automatically file messages.<br/>Whenever Rmail shows a message in the folder that `rmail-file-name'<br/>specifies, it calls `rmail-auto-file' to maybe file the message in<br/>another folder according to this list.  Messages that are already<br/>marked as `filed', or are in different folders, are left alone.<br/><br/>Each element of the list is of the form:<br/><br/>  (FOLDERNAME FIELD REGEXP [ FIELD REGEXP ] ... )<br/><br/>FOLDERNAME is the name of a folder in which to put the message.<br/>If FOLDERNAME is nil then Rmail deletes the message, and moves on to<br/>the next.  If FOLDERNAME is "/dev/null", Rmail deletes the message,<br/>but does not move to the next.<br/><br/>FIELD is the name of a header field in the message, such as<br/>"subject" or "from".  A FIELD of "to" includes all text<br/>from both the "to" and "cc" headers.<br/><br/>REGEXP is a regular expression to match (case-sensitively) against<br/>the preceding specified FIELD.<br/><br/>There may be any number of FIELD/REGEXP pairs.<br/>All pairs must match for a directive to apply to a message.<br/>For a given message, Rmail applies only the first matching directive.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>  ("/dev/null" "from" "@spam.com") ; delete all mail from spam.com<br/>  ("RMS" "from" "rms@") ; save all mail from RMS.<br/><br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 21.1 of Emacs.<br/>
