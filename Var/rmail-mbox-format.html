Its value is <pre>mboxrd</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The mbox format that your system uses.</br>
There is no way to determine this, so you should set the appropriate value.</br>
The formats quote lines containing "From " differently.</br>
The choices are:</br>
  `mboxo' : lines that start with "From " quoted as ">From "</br>
  `mboxrd': lines that start with ">*From " quoted with another ">"</br>
The `mboxo' format is ambiguous, in that one cannot know whether</br>
a line starting with ">From " originally had a ">" or not.</br>
</br>
It is not critical to set this to the correct value; it only affects</br>
how Rmail displays lines starting with ">*From " in non-MIME messages.</br>
</br>
See also `unrmail-mbox-format'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
