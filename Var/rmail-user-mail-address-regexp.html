<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Regexp matching user mail addresses.</br>
If non-nil, this variable is used to identify the correspondent</br>
when receiving new mail.  If it matches the address of the sender,</br>
the recipient is taken as correspondent of a mail.</br>
If nil (default value), your `user-login-name' and `user-mail-address'</br>
are used to exclude yourself as correspondent.</br>
</br>
Usually you don't have to set this variable, except if you collect mails</br>
sent by you under different user names.</br>
Then it should be a regexp matching your mail addresses.</br>
</br>
Setting this variable has an effect only before reading a mail.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
