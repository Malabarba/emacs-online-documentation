Marker for the start of the conditionally up-to-date region.<br/>
It is nil if there is no conditionally up-to-date region.  The<br/>
conditionally up-to-date region must be such that for any cached<br/>
state S with position P in the conditionally up-to-date region,<br/>
if at some point it is determined that S becomes correct for P,<br/>
then all states with position >= P in the conditionally up to<br/>
date region must also then be correct and all errors between P<br/>
and the end of the region must then be correctly marked.
