<strong>same-window-buffer-names</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of names of buffers that should appear in the "same" window.<br/>
`display-buffer' and `pop-to-buffer' show a buffer whose name is<br/>
on this list in the selected rather than some other window.<br/>
<br/>
An element of this list can be a cons cell instead of just a<br/>
string.  In that case, the cell's car must be a string specifying<br/>
the buffer name.  This is for compatibility with<br/>
`special-display-buffer-names'; the cdr of the cons cell is<br/>
ignored.<br/>
<br/>

You can customize this variable.
