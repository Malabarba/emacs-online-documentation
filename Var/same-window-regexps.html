same-window-regexps is a variable defined in `window.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of regexps saying which buffers should appear in the "same" window.<br/>`display-buffer' and `pop-to-buffer' show a buffer whose name<br/>matches a regexp on this list in the selected rather than some<br/>other window.<br/><br/>An element of this list can be a cons cell instead of just a<br/>string.  In that case, the cell's car must be a regexp matching<br/>the buffer name.  This is for compatibility with<br/>`special-display-regexps'; the cdr of the cons cell is ignored.<br/><br/>See also `same-window-buffer-names'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
