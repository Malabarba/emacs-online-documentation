List of additional variables to save.</br>
Each element is a symbol whose value will be persisted across Emacs</br>
sessions that use Savehist.  The contents of variables should be</br>
printable with the Lisp printer.  You don't need to add minibuffer</br>
history variables to this list, all minibuffer histories will be</br>
saved automatically as long as `savehist-save-minibuffer-history' is</br>
non-nil.</br>
</br>
User options should be saved with the Customize interface.  This</br>
list is useful for saving automatically updated variables that are not</br>
minibuffer histories, such as `compile-command' or `kill-ring'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
