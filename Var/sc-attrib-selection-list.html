An alist for selecting preferred attribution based on mail headers.</br>
Each element of this list has the following form:</br>
</br>
   (INFOKEY ((REGEXP . ATTRIBUTION)</br>
             (REGEXP . ATTRIBUTION)</br>
             (...)))</br>
</br>
Where INFOKEY is a key for `sc-mail-field', REGEXP is a regular</br>
expression to match against the INFOKEY's value.  ATTRIBUTION can be a</br>
string or a list.  If it's a string, then it is the attribution that is</br>
selected by `sc-select-attribution'.  If it is a list, it is `eval'd</br>
and the return value must be a string, which is used as the selected</br>
attribution.  Note that the variable `sc-preferred-attribution-list'</br>
must contain an element of the string "sc-consult" for this variable</br>
to be consulted during attribution selection.</br>
