<strong>sc-preferred-attribution-list</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>supercite.el</code>'.</br>

</pre></br>
</br>

Specifies what to use as the attribution string.</br>
Supercite creates a list of possible attributions when it scans the</br>
mail headers from the original message.  Each attribution choice is</br>
associated with a key in an attribution alist.  Supercite tries to</br>
pick a "preferred" attribution by matching the attribution alist</br>
keys against the elements in `sc-preferred-attribution-list' in order.</br>
The first non-empty string value found is used as the preferred</br>
attribution.</br>
</br>
Note that Supercite now honors the X-Attribution: mail field.  If</br>
present in the original message, the value of this field should always</br>
be used to select the most preferred attribution since it reflects how</br>
the original author would like to be distinguished.  It should be</br>
considered bad taste to put any attribution preference key before</br>
"x-attribution" in this list, except perhaps for "sc-lastchoice"</br>
(see below).</br>
</br>
Supercite remembers the last attribution used when reciting an already</br>
cited paragraph.  This attribution will always be saved with the</br>
"sc-lastchoice" key, which can be used in this list.  Note that the</br>
last choice is always reset after every call of `sc-cite-original'.</br>
</br>
Barring error conditions, the following preferences are always present</br>
in the attribution alist:</br>
</br>
"emailname"    -- email terminus name</br>
"initials"     -- initials of author</br>
"firstname"    -- first name of author</br>
"lastname"     -- last name of author</br>
"middlename-1" -- first middle name of author</br>
"middlename-2" -- second middle name of author</br>
...</br>
</br>
Middle name indexes can be any positive integer greater than 0,</br>
although it is unlikely that many authors will supply more than one</br>
middle name, if that many.  The string of all middle names is</br>
associated with the key "middlenames".</br>
