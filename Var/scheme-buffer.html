MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT</br>
===========================================================================</br>
Cmuscheme.el supports, in a fairly simple fashion, running multiple Scheme</br>
processes.  To run multiple Scheme processes, you start the first up with</br>
M-x run-scheme.  It will be in a buffer named *scheme*.  Rename this buffer</br>
with M-x rename-buffer.  You may now start up a new process with another</br>
M-x run-scheme.  It will be in a new buffer, named *scheme*.  You can</br>
switch between the different process buffers with C-x b.</br>
</br>
Commands that send text from source buffers to Scheme processes --</br>
like `scheme-send-definition' or `scheme-compile-region' -- have to choose a</br>
process to send to, when you have more than one Scheme process around.  This</br>
is determined by the global variable `scheme-buffer'.  Suppose you</br>
have three inferior Schemes running:</br>
    Buffer	Process</br>
    foo		scheme</br>
    bar		scheme<2></br>
    *scheme*    scheme<3></br>
If you do a M-x scheme-send-definition-and-go command on some Scheme source</br>
code, what process do you send it to?</br>
</br>
- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *scheme*),</br>
  you send it to that process.</br>
- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you</br>
  send it to the process attached to buffer `scheme-buffer'.</br>
This process selection is performed by function `scheme-proc'.</br>
</br>
Whenever M-x run-scheme fires up a new process, it resets `scheme-buffer'</br>
to be the new process's buffer.  If you only run one process, this will</br>
do the right thing.  If you run multiple processes, you might need to</br>
set `scheme-buffer' to whichever process buffer you want to use.</br>
</br>
More sophisticated approaches are, of course, possible.  If you find yourself</br>
needing to switch back and forth between multiple processes frequently,</br>
you may wish to consider ilisp.el, a larger, more sophisticated package</br>
for running inferior Lisp and Scheme processes.  The approach taken here is</br>
for a minimal, simple implementation.  Feel free to extend it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
