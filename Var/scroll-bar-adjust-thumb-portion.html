Adjust thumb for overscrolling for Gtk+ and MOTIF.</br>
Non-nil means adjust the thumb in the scroll bar so it can be dragged downwards</br>
even if the end of the buffer is shown (i.e. overscrolling).</br>
Set to nil if you want the thumb to be at the bottom when the end of the buffer</br>
is shown.  Also, the thumb fills the whole scroll bar when the entire buffer</br>
is visible.  In this case you can not overscroll.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
