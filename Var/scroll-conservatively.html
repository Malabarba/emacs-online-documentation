<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Scroll up to this many lines, to bring point back on screen.</br>
If point moves off-screen, redisplay will scroll by up to</br>
`scroll-conservatively' lines in order to bring point just barely</br>
onto the screen again.  If that cannot be done, then redisplay</br>
recenters point as usual.</br>
</br>
If the value is greater than 100, redisplay will never recenter point,</br>
but will always scroll just enough text to bring point into view, even</br>
if you move far away.</br>
</br>
A value of zero means always recenter point if it moves off screen.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
