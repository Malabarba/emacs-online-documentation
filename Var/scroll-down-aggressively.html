How far to scroll windows downward.</br>
If you move point off the top, the window scrolls automatically.</br>
This variable controls how far it scrolls.  The value nil, the default,</br>
means scroll to center point.  A fraction means scroll to put point</br>
that fraction of the window's height from the top of the window.</br>
When the value is 0.0, point goes at the top line, which in the</br>
simple case that you moved off with C-b means scrolling just one line.</br>
1.0 means point goes at the bottom, so that in that simple case, the</br>
window scrolls by a full window height.  Meaningful values are</br>
between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
