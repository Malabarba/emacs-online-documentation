Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Controls if scroll commands move point to keep its screen position unchanged.</br>
A value of nil means point does not keep its screen position except</br>
at the scroll margin or window boundary respectively.</br>
A value of t means point keeps its screen position if the scroll</br>
command moved it vertically out of the window, e.g. when scrolling</br>
by full screens.</br>
Any other value means point always keeps its screen position.</br>
Scroll commands should have the `scroll-command' property</br>
on their symbols to be controlled by this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
