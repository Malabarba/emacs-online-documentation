<strong>scroll-step</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>0</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The number of lines to try scrolling a window by when point moves out.</br>
If that fails to bring point back on frame, point is centered instead.</br>
If this is zero, point is always centered after it moves off frame.</br>
If you want scrolling to always be a line at a time, you should set</br>
`scroll-conservatively' to a large value rather than set this to 1.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
