If non-nil, upper case chars disable case fold searching.</br>
That is, upper and lower case chars must match exactly.</br>
This applies no matter where the chars come from, but does not</br>
apply to chars in regexps that are prefixed with `\'.</br>
If this value is `not-yanks', text yanked into the search string</br>
in Isearch mode is always downcased.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
