<strong>search-whitespace-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>isearch.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"\\s-+"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, regular expression to match a sequence of whitespace chars.</br>
When you enter a space or spaces in the incremental search, it</br>
will match any sequence matched by this regexp.  As an exception,</br>
spaces are treated normally in regexp incremental search if they</br>
occur in a regexp construct like [...] or *, + or ?.</br>
</br>
If the value is a string, it applies to both ordinary and</br>
regexp incremental search.  If the value is nil, or</br>
`isearch-lax-whitespace' is nil for ordinary incremental search, or</br>
`isearch-regexp-lax-whitespace' is nil for regexp incremental search,</br>
then each space you type matches literally, against one space.</br>
</br>
You might want to use something like "[ \t\r\n]+" instead.</br>
In the Customization buffer, that is `[' followed by a space,</br>
a tab, a carriage return (control-M), a newline, and `]+'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
