<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
An alist associating X Windows selection-types with functions.</br>
These functions are called to convert the selection, with three args:</br>
the name of the selection (typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD');</br>
a desired type to which the selection should be converted;</br>
and the local selection value (whatever was given to</br>
`x-own-selection-internal').</br>
</br>
The function should return the value to send to the X server</br>
(typically a string).  A return value of nil</br>
means that the conversion could not be done.</br>
A return value which is the symbol `NULL'</br>
means that a side-effect was executed,</br>
and there is no meaningful selection value.</br>
