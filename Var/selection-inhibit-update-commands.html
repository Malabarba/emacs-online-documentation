List of commands which should not update the selection.<br/>
Normally, if `select-active-regions' is non-nil and the mark remains<br/>
active after a command (i.e. the mark was not deactivated), the Emacs<br/>
command loop sets the selection to the text in the region.  However,<br/>
if the command is in this list, the selection is not updated.
