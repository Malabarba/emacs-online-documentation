Non-nil enables selective display.</br>
An integer N as value means display only lines</br>
that start with less than N columns of space.</br>
A value of t means that the character ^M makes itself and</br>
all the rest of the line invisible; also, when saving the buffer</br>
in a file, save the ^M as a newline.
