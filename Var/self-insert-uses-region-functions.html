Special hook to tell if `self-insert-command' will use the region.</br>
It must be called via `run-hook-with-args-until-success' with no arguments.</br>
Any `post-self-insert-command' which consumes the region should</br>
register a function on this hook so that things like `delete-selection-mode'</br>
can refrain from consuming the region.
