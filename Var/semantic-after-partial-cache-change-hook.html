Normal hook run after the buffer cache has been updated.<br/>
<br/>
This hook will run when the cache has been partially reparsed.<br/>
Partial reparses are incurred when a user edits a buffer, and only the<br/>
modified sections are rescanned.<br/>
<br/>
Hook functions must take one argument, which is the list of tags<br/>
updated in the current buffer.<br/>
<br/>
For language specific hooks, make sure you define this as a local hook.
