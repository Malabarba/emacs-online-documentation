Hooks run after the buffer tag list has changed.</br>
This list will change when a buffer is reparsed, or when the tag list</br>
in a buffer is cleared.  It is *NOT* called if the current tag list is</br>
partially reparsed.</br>
</br>
Hook functions must take one argument, which is the new list of tags</br>
associated with this buffer.</br>
</br>
For language specific hooks, make sure you define this as a local hook.
