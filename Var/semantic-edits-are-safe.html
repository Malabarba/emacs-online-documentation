<strong>semantic-edits-are-safe</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>semantic.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
When non-nil, modifications do not require a reparse.<br/>
This prevents tags from being marked dirty, and it prevents top level<br/>
edits from causing a cache check.<br/>
Use this when writing programs that could cause a full reparse, but<br/>
will not change the tag structure, such as adding or updating<br/>
`top-level' comments.
