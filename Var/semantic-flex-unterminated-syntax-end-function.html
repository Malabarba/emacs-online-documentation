Function called when unterminated syntax is encountered.<br/>
This should be set to one function.  That function should take three<br/>
parameters.  The SYNTAX, or type of syntax which is unterminated.<br/>
SYNTAX-START where the broken syntax begins.<br/>
FLEX-END is where the lexical analysis was asked to end.<br/>
This function can be used for languages that can intelligently fix up<br/>
broken syntax, or the exit lexical analysis via `throw' or `signal'<br/>
when finding unterminated syntax.
