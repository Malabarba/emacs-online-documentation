Function called when an externally defined orphan is found.</br>
By default, the token is always marked with the `adopted' property.</br>
This function should be locally bound by a program that needs</br>
to add additional behaviors into the token list.</br>
This function is called with two arguments.  The first is TOKEN which is</br>
a shallow copy of the token to be modified.  The second is the PARENT</br>
which is adopting TOKEN.  This function should return TOKEN (or a copy of it)</br>
which is then integrated into the revised token list.
