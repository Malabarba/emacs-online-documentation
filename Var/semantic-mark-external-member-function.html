Function called when an externally defined orphan is found.<br/>
By default, the token is always marked with the `adopted' property.<br/>
This function should be locally bound by a program that needs<br/>
to add additional behaviors into the token list.<br/>
This function is called with two arguments.  The first is TOKEN which is<br/>
a shallow copy of the token to be modified.  The second is the PARENT<br/>
which is adopting TOKEN.  This function should return TOKEN (or a copy of it)<br/>
which is then integrated into the revised token list.
