Like `semantic-symbol->name-assoc-list' for type parts.</br>
Some tags that have children (see `semantic-tag-children-compatibility')</br>
will want to define the names of classes of tags differently than at</br>
the top level.  For example, in C++, a Function may be called a</br>
Method.  In addition, there may be new types of tags that exist only</br>
in classes, such as protection labels.
