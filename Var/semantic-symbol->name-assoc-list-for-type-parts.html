Some tags that have children (see `semantic-tag-children-compatibility')<br/>
will want to define the names of classes of tags differently than at<br/>
the top level.  For example, in C++, a Function may be called a<br/>
Method.  In addition, there may be new types of tags that exist only<br/>
in classes, such as protection labels.
