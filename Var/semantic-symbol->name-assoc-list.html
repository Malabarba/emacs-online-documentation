Association between symbols returned, and a string.</br>
The string is used to represent a group of objects of the given type.</br>
It is sometimes useful for a language to use a different string</br>
in place of the default, even though that language will still</br>
return a symbol.  For example, Java return's includes, but the</br>
string can be replaced with `Imports'.
