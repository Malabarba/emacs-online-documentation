Documentation:<br/>
Function used to expand a tag.<br/>
It is passed each tag production, and must return a list of tags<br/>
derived from it, or nil if it does not need to be expanded.<br/>
<br/>
Languages with compound definitions should use this function to expand<br/>
from one compound symbol into several.  For example, in C or Java the<br/>
following definition is easily parsed into one tag:<br/>
<br/>
  int a, b;<br/>
<br/>
This function should take this compound tag and turn it into two tags,<br/>
one for A, and the other for B.
