Character strings used to separate a parent/child relationship.</br>
This list of strings are used for displaying or finding separators</br>
in variable field dereferencing.  The first character will be used for</br>
display.  In C, a type field is separated like this: "type.field"</br>
thus, the character is a ".".  In C, and additional value of "->"</br>
would be in the list, so that "type->field" could be found.
