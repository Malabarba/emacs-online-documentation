semantic-unmatched-syntax-hook is a variable defined in `semantic.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hooks run when Semantic detects syntax not matched in a grammar.<br/>Each individual piece of syntax (such as a symbol or punctuation<br/>character) is called with this hook when it doesn't match in the<br/>grammar, and multiple unmatched syntax elements are not grouped<br/>together.  Each hook is called with one argument, which is a list<br/>of syntax tokens created by the semantic lexer.  Use the functions<br/>`semantic-lex-token-start', `semantic-lex-token-end' and<br/>`semantic-lex-token-text' to get information about these tokens.<br/>The current buffer is the buffer these tokens are derived from.
