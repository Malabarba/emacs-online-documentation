Hooks run when Semantic detects syntax not matched in a grammar.</br>
Each individual piece of syntax (such as a symbol or punctuation</br>
character) is called with this hook when it doesn't match in the</br>
grammar, and multiple unmatched syntax elements are not grouped</br>
together.  Each hook is called with one argument, which is a list</br>
of syntax tokens created by the semantic lexer.  Use the functions</br>
`semantic-lex-token-start', `semantic-lex-token-end' and</br>
`semantic-lex-token-text' to get information about these tokens.</br>
The current buffer is the buffer these tokens are derived from.
