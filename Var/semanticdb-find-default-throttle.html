<strong>semanticdb-find-default-throttle</strong>'s value is (local project unloaded system recursive)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The default throttle for `semanticdb-find' routines.<br/>
The throttle controls how detailed the list of database<br/>
tables is for a symbol lookup.  The value is a list with<br/>
the following keys:<br/>
  `file'       - The file the search is being performed from.<br/>
                 This option is here for completeness only, and<br/>
                 is assumed to always be on.<br/>
  `local'      - Tables from the same local directory are included.<br/>
                 This includes files directly referenced by a file name<br/>
                 which might be in a different directory.<br/>
  `project'    - Tables from the same local project are included<br/>
                 If `project' is specified, then `local' is assumed.<br/>
  `unloaded'   - If a table is not in memory, load it.  If it is not cached<br/>
                 on disk either, get the source, parse it, and create<br/>
                 the table.<br/>
  `system'     - Tables from system databases.  These are specifically<br/>
                 tables from system header files, or language equivalent.<br/>
  `recursive'  - For include based searches, includes tables referenced<br/>
                 by included files.<br/>
  `omniscience' - Included system databases which are omniscience, or<br/>
                 somehow know everything.  Omniscience databases are found<br/>
                 in `semanticdb-project-system-databases'.<br/>
                 The Emacs Lisp system DB is an omniscience database.<br/>
