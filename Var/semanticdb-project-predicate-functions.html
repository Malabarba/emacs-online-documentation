List of predicates to try that indicate a directory belongs to a project.</br>
This list is used when `semanticdb-persistent-path' contains the value</br>
'project.  If the predicate list is nil, then presume all paths are valid.</br>
</br>
Project Management software (such as EDE and JDE) should add their own</br>
predicates with `add-hook' to this variable, and semanticdb will save tag</br>
caches in directories controlled by them.
