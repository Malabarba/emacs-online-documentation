<strong>semanticdb-project-predicate-functions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>db.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of predicates to try that indicate a directory belongs to a project.<br/>
This list is used when `semanticdb-persistent-path' contains the value<br/>
'project.  If the predicate list is nil, then presume all paths are valid.<br/>
<br/>
Project Management software (such as EDE and JDE) should add their own<br/>
predicates with `add-hook' to this variable, and semanticdb will save tag<br/>
caches in directories controlled by them.
