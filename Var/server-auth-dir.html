Directory for server authentication files.</br>
We only use this if `server-use-tcp' is non-nil.</br>
Otherwise we use `server-socket-dir'.</br>
</br>
NOTE: On FAT32 filesystems, directories are not secure;</br>
files can be read and modified by any user or process.</br>
It is strongly suggested to set `server-auth-dir' to a</br>
directory residing in a NTFS partition instead.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
