<strong>server-auth-key</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>server.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Server authentication key.</br>
This is only used if `server-use-tcp' is non-nil.</br>
</br>
Normally, the authentication key is randomly generated when the</br>
server starts.  It is recommended to leave it that way.  Using a</br>
long-lived shared key will decrease security (especially since</br>
the key is transmitted as plain-text).</br>
</br>
In some situations however, it can be difficult to share randomly</br>
generated passwords with remote hosts (e.g., no shared directory),</br>
so you can set the key with this variable and then copy the</br>
server file to the remote host (with possible changes to IP</br>
address and/or port if that applies).</br>
</br>
Note that the usual security risks of using the server over</br>
remote TCP, arising from the fact that client-server</br>
communications are unencrypted, still apply.</br>
</br>
The key must consist of 64 ASCII printable characters except for</br>
space (this means characters from ! to ~; or from code 33 to</br>
126).  You can use M-x server-generate-key to get a random key.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
