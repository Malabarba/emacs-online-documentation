<strong>server-host</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>server.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The name or IP address to use as host address of the server process.<br/>
If set, the server accepts remote connections; otherwise it is local.<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT give this a non-nil value unless you know what you are<br/>
doing!  On unsecured networks, accepting remote connections is<br/>
very dangerous, because server-client communication (including<br/>
session authentication) is not encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
