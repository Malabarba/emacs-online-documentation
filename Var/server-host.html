Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The name or IP address to use as host address of the server process.</br>
If set, the server accepts remote connections; otherwise it is local.</br>
</br>
DO NOT give this a non-nil value unless you know what you are doing!</br>
On unsecured networks, accepting remote connections is very dangerous,</br>
because server-client communication (including session authentication)</br>
is not encrypted.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
