Whether to kill buffers when done with them.</br>
If non-nil, kill a buffer unless it already existed before editing</br>
it with the Emacs server.  If nil, kill only buffers as specified by</br>
`server-temp-file-regexp'.</br>
Please note that only buffers that still have a client are killed,</br>
i.e. buffers visited with "emacsclient --no-wait" are never killed</br>
in this way.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
