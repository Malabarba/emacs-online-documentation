Set by `ses-relocate-formula' and `ses-relocate-range', read by</br>
`ses-relocate-all'.  Set to 'delete if a cell-reference was deleted from a</br>
formula--so the formula needs recalculation.  Set to 'range if the size of a</br>
`ses-range' was changed--so both the formula's value and list of dependents</br>
need to be recalculated.
