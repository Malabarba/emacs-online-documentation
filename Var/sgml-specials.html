sgml-specials is a variable defined in `sgml-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is (34)<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of characters that have a special meaning for SGML mode.<br/>This list is used when first loading the `sgml-mode' library.<br/>The supported characters and potential disadvantages are:<br/><br/>  ?\"	Makes " in text start a string.<br/>  ?'	Makes ' in text start a string.<br/>  ?-	Makes -- in text start a comment.<br/><br/>When only one of ?\" or ?' are included, "'" or '"', as can be found in<br/>DTDs, start a string.  To partially avoid this problem this also makes these<br/>self insert as named entities depending on `sgml-quick-keys'.<br/><br/>Including ?- has the problem of affecting dashes that have nothing to do<br/>with comments, so we normally turn it off.
