List of characters that have a special meaning for SGML mode.</br>
This list is used when first loading the `sgml-mode' library.</br>
The supported characters and potential disadvantages are:</br>
</br>
  ?\"	Makes " in text start a string.</br>
  ?'	Makes ' in text start a string.</br>
  ?-	Makes -- in text start a comment.</br>
</br>
When only one of ?\" or ?' are included, "'" or '"', as can be found in</br>
DTDs, start a string.  To partially avoid this problem this also makes these</br>
self insert as named entities depending on `sgml-quick-keys'.</br>
</br>
Including ?- has the problem of affecting dashes that have nothing to do</br>
with comments, so we normally turn it off.
