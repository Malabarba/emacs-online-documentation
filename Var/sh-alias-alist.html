Alist for transforming shell names to what they really are.</br>
Use this where the name of the executable doesn't correspond to</br>
the type of shell it really is.  Keys are regular expressions</br>
matched against the full path of the interpreter.  (For backward</br>
compatibility, keys may also be symbols, which are matched</br>
against the interpreter's basename.  The values are symbols</br>
naming the shell.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
