<strong>sh-here-document-word</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>sh-script.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "EOF"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Word to delimit here documents.<br/>
If the first character of this string is "-", this is taken as<br/>
part of the redirection operator, rather than part of the<br/>
word (that is, "<<-" instead of "<<").  This is a feature<br/>
used by some shells (for example Bash) to indicate that leading<br/>
tabs inside the here document should be ignored.  In this case,<br/>
Emacs indents the initial body and end of the here document with<br/>
tabs, to the same level as the start (note that apart from this<br/>
there is no support for indentation of here documents).  This<br/>
will only work correctly if `sh-basic-offset' is a multiple of<br/>
`tab-width'.<br/>
<br/>
Any quote characters or leading whitespace in the word are<br/>
removed when closing the here document.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
