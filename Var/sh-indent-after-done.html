How much to indent a statement after a `done' keyword.<br/>
Normally this is 0, which aligns the `done' to the matching<br/>
looping construct line.<br/>
Setting it non-zero allows you to have the `do' statement on a line<br/>
by itself and align the done under to do.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
