File to store the list of uncopied shadows in.</br>
This means that if a remote system is down, or for any reason you cannot or</br>
decide not to copy your shadow files at the end of one Emacs session, it will</br>
remember and ask you again in your next Emacs session.</br>
This file must NOT be shadowed to any other system, it is host-specific.</br>
Default: ~/.emacs.d/shadow_todo</br>

You can customize this variable.
