<strong>shell-dumb-shell-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>shell.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "cmd\\(proxy\\)?\\.exe"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Regexp to match shells that don't save their command history, and<br/>
don't handle the backslash as a quote character.  For shells that<br/>
match this regexp, Emacs will write out the command history when the<br/>
shell finishes, and won't remove backslashes when it unquotes shell<br/>
arguments.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
