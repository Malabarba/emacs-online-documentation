<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Regexp to match shells that don't save their command history, and</br>
don't handle the backslash as a quote character.  For shells that</br>
match this regexp, Emacs will write out the command history when the</br>
shell finishes, and won't remove backslashes when it unquotes shell</br>
arguments.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
