shell-prompt-pattern is a variable defined in `shell.el'.<br/>Its value is "^[^#$%><br/>]*[#$%>] *"<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Regexp to match prompts in the inferior shell.<br/>Defaults to "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *", which works pretty well.<br/>This variable is used to initialize `comint-prompt-regexp' in the<br/>shell buffer.<br/><br/>If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is nil, then this variable is only used<br/>to determine paragraph boundaries.  See Info node `Shell Prompts' for<br/>how Shell mode treats paragraphs.<br/><br/>The pattern should probably not match more than one line.  If it does,<br/>Shell mode may become confused trying to distinguish prompt from input<br/>on lines which don't start with a prompt.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
