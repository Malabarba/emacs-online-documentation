How big pictures displayed are in relation to the window they're in.</br>
A value of 0.7 means that they are allowed to take up 70% of the</br>
width and height of the window.  If they are larger than this,</br>
and Emacs supports it, then the images will be rescaled down to</br>
fit these criteria.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
