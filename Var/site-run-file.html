<strong>site-run-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>startup.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>"site-start"</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
File containing site-wide run-time initializations.</br>
This file is loaded at run-time before `~/.emacs'.  It contains inits</br>
that need to be in place for the entire site, but which, due to their</br>
higher incidence of change, don't make sense to load into Emacs's</br>
dumped image.  Thus, the run-time load order is: 1. file described in</br>
this variable, if non-nil; 2. `~/.emacs'; 3. `default.el'.</br>
</br>
Don't use the `site-start.el' file for things some users may not like.</br>
Put them in `default.el' instead, so that users can more easily</br>
override them.  Users can prevent loading `default.el' with the `-q'</br>
option or by setting `inhibit-default-init' in their own init files,</br>
but inhibiting `site-start.el' requires `--no-site-file', which</br>
is less convenient.</br>
</br>
This variable is defined for customization so as to make</br>
it visible in the relevant context.  However, actually customizing it</br>
is not allowed, since it would not work anyway.  The only way to set</br>
this variable usefully is to set it while building and dumping Emacs.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
