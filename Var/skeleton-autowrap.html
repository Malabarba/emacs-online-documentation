Controls wrapping behavior of functions created with `define-skeleton'.</br>
When the region is visible (due to `transient-mark-mode' or marking a region</br>
with the mouse) and this is non-nil and the function was called without an</br>
explicit ARG, then the ARG defaults to -1, i.e. wrapping around the visible</br>
region.
