<strong>skeleton-autowrap</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>skeleton.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Controls wrapping behavior of functions created with `define-skeleton'.</br>
When the region is visible (due to `transient-mark-mode' or marking a region</br>
with the mouse) and this is non-nil and the function was called without an</br>
explicit ARG, then the ARG defaults to -1, i.e. wrapping around the visible</br>
region.</br>
</br>
We will probably delete this variable in a future Emacs version</br>
unless we get a substantial number of complaints about the auto-wrap</br>
feature.
