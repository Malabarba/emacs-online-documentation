If non-nil, pass to diff as many lines as there are chars in the region.<br/>
I.e. each atomic element (e.g. word) will be copied as many times (on different<br/>
lines) as it has chars.  This has two advantages:<br/>
- if `diff' tries to minimize the number *lines* (rather than chars)<br/>
  added/removed, this adjust the weights so that adding/removing long<br/>
  symbols is considered correspondingly more costly.<br/>
- `smerge-refine-forward-function' only needs to be called when chopping up<br/>
  the regions, and `forward-char' can be used afterwards.<br/>
It has the following disadvantages:<br/>
- cannot use `diff -w' because the weighting causes added spaces in a line<br/>
  to be represented as added copies of some line, so `diff -w' can't do the<br/>
  right thing any more.<br/>
- may in degenerate cases take a 1KB input region and turn it into a 1MB<br/>
  file to pass to diff.
