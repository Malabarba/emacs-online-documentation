If non-nil, pass to diff as many lines as there are chars in the region.</br>
I.e. each atomic element (e.g. word) will be copied as many times (on different</br>
lines) as it has chars.  This has two advantages:</br>
- if `diff' tries to minimize the number *lines* (rather than chars)</br>
  added/removed, this adjust the weights so that adding/removing long</br>
  symbols is considered correspondingly more costly.</br>
- `smerge-refine-forward-function' only needs to be called when chopping up</br>
  the regions, and `forward-char' can be used afterwards.</br>
It has the following disadvantages:</br>
- cannot use `diff -w' because the weighting causes added spaces in a line</br>
  to be represented as added copies of some line, so `diff -w' can't do the</br>
  right thing any more.</br>
- may in degenerate cases take a 1KB input region and turn it into a 1MB</br>
  file to pass to diff.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
