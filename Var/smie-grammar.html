List of token parsing info.</br>
This list is normally built by `smie-prec2->grammar'.</br>
Each element is of the form (TOKEN LEFT-LEVEL RIGHT-LEVEL).</br>
Parsing is done using an operator precedence parser.</br>
LEFT-LEVEL and RIGHT-LEVEL can be either numbers or a list, where a list</br>
means that this operator does not bind on the corresponding side,</br>
e.g. a LEFT-LEVEL of nil means this is a token that behaves somewhat like</br>
an open-paren, whereas a RIGHT-LEVEL of nil would correspond to something</br>
like a close-paren.
