smie-rules-function is a variable defined in `smie.el'.<br/>Its value is ignore<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Function providing the indentation rules.<br/>It takes two arguments METHOD and ARG where the meaning of ARG<br/>and the expected return value depends on METHOD.<br/>METHOD can be:<br/>- :after, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return the<br/>  OFFSET to use for indentation after ARG.<br/>- :before, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return the<br/>  OFFSET to use to indent ARG itself.<br/>- :elem, in which case the function should return either:<br/>  - the offset to use to indent function arguments (ARG = `arg')<br/>  - the basic indentation step (ARG = `basic').<br/>- :list-intro, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return<br/>  non-nil if TOKEN is followed by a list of expressions (not separated by any<br/>  token) rather than an expression.<br/><br/>When ARG is a token, the function is called with point just before that token.<br/>A return value of nil always means to fallback on the default behavior, so the<br/>function should return nil for arguments it does not expect.<br/><br/>OFFSET can be:<br/>nil				use the default indentation rule.<br/>(column . COLUMN)		indent to column COLUMN.<br/>NUMBER				offset by NUMBER, relative to a base token<br/>				which is the current token for :after and<br/>				its parent for :before.<br/><br/>The functions whose name starts with "smie-rule-" are helper functions<br/>designed specifically for use in this function.
