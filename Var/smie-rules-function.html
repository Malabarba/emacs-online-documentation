Function providing the indentation rules.</br>
It takes two arguments METHOD and ARG where the meaning of ARG</br>
and the expected return value depends on METHOD.</br>
METHOD can be:</br>
- :after, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return the</br>
  OFFSET to use for indentation after ARG.</br>
- :before, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return the</br>
  OFFSET to use to indent ARG itself.</br>
- :elem, in which case the function should return either:</br>
  - the offset to use to indent function arguments (ARG = `arg')</br>
  - the basic indentation step (ARG = `basic').</br>
- :list-intro, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return</br>
  non-nil if TOKEN is followed by a list of expressions (not separated by any</br>
  token) rather than an expression.</br>
- :close-all, in which case ARG is a close-paren token at indentation and</br>
  the function should return non-nil if it should be aligned with the opener</br>
  of the last close-paren token on the same line, if there are multiple.</br>
  Otherwise, it will be aligned with its own opener.</br>
</br>
When ARG is a token, the function is called with point just before that token.</br>
A return value of nil always means to fallback on the default behavior, so the</br>
function should return nil for arguments it does not expect.</br>
</br>
OFFSET can be:</br>
nil				use the default indentation rule.</br>
(column . COLUMN)		indent to column COLUMN.</br>
NUMBER				offset by NUMBER, relative to a base token</br>
				which is the current token for :after and</br>
				its parent for :before.</br>
