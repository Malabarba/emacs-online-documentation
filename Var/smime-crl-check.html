*Check revocation status of signers certificate using CRLs.</br>
Enabling this will have OpenSSL check the signers certificate</br>
against a certificate revocation list (CRL).</br>
</br>
For this to work the CRL must be up-to-date and since they are</br>
normally updated quite often (i.e., several times a day) you</br>
probably need some tool to keep them up-to-date. Unfortunately</br>
Gnus cannot do this for you.</br>
</br>
The CRL should either be appended (in PEM format) to your</br>
`smime-CA-file' or be located in a file (also in PEM format) in</br>
your `smime-certificate-directory' named to the X.509 hash of the</br>
certificate with .r0 as file name extension.</br>
</br>
At least OpenSSL version 0.9.7 is required for this to work.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
