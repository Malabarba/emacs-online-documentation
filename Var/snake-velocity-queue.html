This queue stores the velocities requested too quickly by user.</br>
They will take effect one at a time at each clock-interval.</br>
This is necessary for proper behavior.</br>
</br>
For instance, if you are moving right, you press up and then left, you</br>
want the snake to move up just once before starting to move left.  If</br>
we implemented all your keystrokes immediately, the snake would</br>
effectively never move up.  Thus, we need to move it up for one turn</br>
and then start moving it leftwards.
