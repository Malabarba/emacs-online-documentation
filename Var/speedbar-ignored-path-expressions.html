List of regular expressions matching directories speedbar will ignore.</br>
They should included directories which are notoriously very large</br>
and take a long time to load in.  Use the function</br>
`speedbar-add-ignored-directory-regexp' to add new items to this list after</br>
speedbar is loaded.  You may place anything you like in this list</br>
before speedbar has been loaded.</br>
