Non-nil means speedbar should use smart expansion.</br>
Smart expansion only affects when speedbar wants to display a</br>
directory for a file in the attached frame.  When smart expansion is</br>
enabled, new directories which are children of a displayed directory</br>
are expanded in the current framework.  If nil, then the current</br>
hierarchy would be replaced with the new directory.</br>
