<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Minimum height for splitting windows sensibly.</br>
If this is an integer, `split-window-sensibly' may split a window</br>
vertically only if it has at least this many lines.  If this is</br>
nil, `split-window-sensibly' is not allowed to split a window</br>
vertically.  If, however, a window is the only window on its</br>
frame, `split-window-sensibly' may split it vertically</br>
disregarding the value of this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
