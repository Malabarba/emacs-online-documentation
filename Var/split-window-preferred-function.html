Function called by `display-buffer' routines to split a window.</br>
This function is called with a window as single argument and is</br>
supposed to split that window and return the new window.  If the</br>
window can (or shall) not be split, it is supposed to return nil.</br>
The default is to call the function `split-window-sensibly' which</br>
tries to split the window in a way which seems most suitable.</br>
You can customize the options `split-height-threshold' and/or</br>
`split-width-threshold' in order to have `split-window-sensibly'</br>
prefer either vertical or horizontal splitting.</br>
</br>
If you set this to any other function, bear in mind that the</br>
`display-buffer' routines may call this function two times.  The</br>
argument of the first call is the largest window on its frame.</br>
If that call fails to return a live window, the function is</br>
called again with the least recently used window as argument.  If</br>
that call fails too, `display-buffer' will use an existing window</br>
to display its buffer.</br>
</br>
The window selected at the time `display-buffer' was invoked is</br>
still selected when this function is called.  Hence you can</br>
compare the window argument with the value of `selected-window'</br>
if you intend to split the selected window instead or if you do</br>
not want to split the selected window.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
