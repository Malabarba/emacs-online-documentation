"Show short help for the SQL modes.\nUse an entry function to open an interactive SQL buffer.  This buffer is\nusually named `*SQL*'.  The name of the major mode is SQLi.\n\nUse the following commands to start a specific SQL interpreter:\n\n    \\\\FREE\n\nOther non-free SQL implementations are also supported:\n\n    \\\\NONFREE\n\nBut we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.\n\nYou can also use \\[sql-product-interactive] to invoke the\ninterpreter for the current `sql-product'.\n\nOnce you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the\nbuffer.  The output generated is appended to the buffer and a new prompt\nis generated.  See the In/Out menu in the SQLi buffer for some functions\nthat help you navigate through the buffer, the input history, etc.\n\nIf you have a really complex SQL statement or if you are writing a\nprocedure, you can do this in a separate buffer.  Put the new buffer in\n`sql-mode' by calling \\[sql-mode].  The name of this buffer can be\nanything.  The name of the major mode is SQL.\n\nIn this SQL buffer (SQL mode), you can send the region or the entire\nbuffer to the interactive SQL buffer (SQLi mode).  The results are\nappended to the SQLi buffer without disturbing your SQL buffer."</pre></br>
