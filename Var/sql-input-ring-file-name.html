<strong>sql-input-ring-file-name</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>sql.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, name of the file to read/write input history.<br/>
<br/>
You have to set this variable if you want the history of your commands<br/>
saved from one Emacs session to the next.  If this variable is set,<br/>
exiting the SQL interpreter in an SQLi buffer will write the input<br/>
history to the specified file.  Starting a new process in a SQLi buffer<br/>
will read the input history from the specified file.<br/>
<br/>
This is used to initialize `comint-input-ring-file-name'.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the size of the input history is determined by the variable<br/>
`comint-input-ring-size'.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
