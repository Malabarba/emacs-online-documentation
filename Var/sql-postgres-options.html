<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of additional options for `sql-postgres-program'.</br>
The default setting includes the -P option which breaks older versions</br>
of the psql client (such as version 6.5.3).  The -P option is equivalent</br>
to the --pset option.  If you want the psql to prompt you for a user</br>
name, add the string "-u" to the list of options.  If you want to</br>
provide a user name on the command line (newer versions such as 7.1),</br>
add your name with a "-U" prefix (such as "-Umark") to the list.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 20.8 of Emacs.
