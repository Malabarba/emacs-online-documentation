Its value is ("-P" "pager=off")<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of additional options for `sql-postgres-program'.<br/>
The default setting includes the -P option which breaks older versions<br/>
of the psql client (such as version 6.5.3).  The -P option is equivalent<br/>
to the --pset option.  If you want the psql to prompt you for a user<br/>
name, add the string "-u" to the list of options.  If you want to<br/>
provide a user name on the command line (newer versions such as 7.1),<br/>
add your name with a "-U" prefix (such as "-Umark") to the list.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 20.8 of Emacs.<br/>
