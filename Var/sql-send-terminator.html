<strong>sql-send-terminator</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>sql.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
When non-nil, add a terminator to text sent to the SQL interpreter.</br>
</br>
When text is sent to the SQL interpreter (via `sql-send-string',</br>
`sql-send-region', `sql-send-paragraph' or `sql-send-buffer'), a</br>
command terminator can be automatically sent as well.  The</br>
terminator is not sent, if the string sent already ends with the</br>
terminator.</br>
</br>
If this value is t, then the default command terminator for the</br>
SQL interpreter is sent.  If this value is a string, then the</br>
string is sent.</br>
</br>
If the value is a cons cell of the form (PAT . TERM), then PAT is</br>
a regexp used to match the terminator in the string and TERM is</br>
the terminator to be sent.  This form is useful if the SQL</br>
interpreter has more than one way of submitting a SQL command.</br>
The PAT regexp can match any of them, and TERM is the way we do</br>
it automatically.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.2 of Emacs.
