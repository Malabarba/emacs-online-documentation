Integer defining dimensions of the stroke grid.</br>
The grid is a square grid, where `strokes-grid-resolution' defaults to</br>
`9', making a 9x9 grid whose coordinates go from (0 . 0) on the top</br>
left to ((strokes-grid-resolution - 1) . (strokes-grid-resolution - 1))</br>
on the bottom right.  The greater the resolution, the more intricate</br>
your strokes can be.</br>
NOTE: This variable should be odd and MUST NOT be less than 3 and need</br>
      not be greater than 33, which is the resolution of the pixmaps.</br>
WARNING: Changing the value of this variable will gravely affect the</br>
         strokes you have already programmed in.  You should try to</br>
         figure out what it should be based on your needs and on how</br>
         quick the particular platform(s) you're operating on, and</br>
         only then start programming in your custom strokes.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
