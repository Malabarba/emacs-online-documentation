<strong>strokes-minimum-match-score</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>strokes.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>1000</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Minimum score for a stroke to be considered a possible match.</br>
Setting this variable to 0 would require a perfectly precise match.</br>
The default value is 1000, but it's mostly dependent on how precisely</br>
you manage to replicate your user-defined strokes.  It also depends on</br>
the value of `strokes-grid-resolution', since a higher grid resolution</br>
will correspond to more sample points, and thus more distance</br>
measurements.  Usually, this is not a problem since you first set</br>
`strokes-grid-resolution' based on what your computer seems to be able</br>
to handle (though the defaults are usually more than sufficient), and</br>
then you can set `strokes-minimum-match-score' to something that works</br>
for you.  The only purpose of this variable is to insure that if you</br>
do a bogus stroke that really doesn't match any of the predefined</br>
ones, then strokes should NOT pick the one that came closest.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
