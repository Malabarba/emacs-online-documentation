Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, `switch-to-buffer' tries to preserve `window-point'.</br>
If this is nil, `switch-to-buffer' displays the buffer at that</br>
buffer's `point'.  If this is `already-displayed', it tries to</br>
display the buffer at its previous position in the selected</br>
window, provided the buffer is currently displayed in some other</br>
window on any visible or iconified frame.  If this is t, it</br>
unconditionally tries to display the buffer at its previous</br>
position in the selected window.</br>
</br>
This variable is ignored if the buffer is already displayed in</br>
the selected window or never appeared in it before, or if</br>
`switch-to-buffer' calls `pop-to-buffer' to display the buffer.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
