<strong>switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, `switch-to-buffer' tries to preserve `window-point'.<br/>
If this is nil, `switch-to-buffer' displays the buffer at that<br/>
buffer's `point'.  If this is `already-displayed', it tries to<br/>
display the buffer at its previous position in the selected<br/>
window, provided the buffer is currently displayed in some other<br/>
window on any visible or iconified frame.  If this is t, it<br/>
unconditionally tries to display the buffer at its previous<br/>
position in the selected window.<br/>
<br/>
This variable is ignored if the buffer is already displayed in<br/>
the selected window or never appeared in it before, or if<br/>
`switch-to-buffer' calls `pop-to-buffer' to display the buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.3 of Emacs.<br/>
