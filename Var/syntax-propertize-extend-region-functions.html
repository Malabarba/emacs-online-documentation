syntax-propertize-extend-region-functions is a variable defined in `syntax.el'.<br/>Its value is (syntax-propertize-wholelines)<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Special hook run just before proceeding to propertize a region.<br/>This is used to allow major modes to help `syntax-propertize' find safe buffer<br/>positions as beginning and end of the propertized region.  Its most common use<br/>is to solve the problem of /identification/ of multiline elements by providing<br/>a function that tries to find such elements and move the boundaries such that<br/>they do not fall in the middle of one.<br/>Each function is called with two arguments (START and END) and it should return<br/>either a cons (NEW-START . NEW-END) or nil if no adjustment should be made.<br/>These functions are run in turn repeatedly until they all return nil.<br/>Put first the functions more likely to cause a change and cheaper to compute.
