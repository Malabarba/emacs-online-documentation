Special hook run just before proceeding to propertize a region.</br>
This is used to allow major modes to help `syntax-propertize' find safe buffer</br>
positions as beginning and end of the propertized region.  Its most common use</br>
is to solve the problem of /identification/ of multiline elements by providing</br>
a function that tries to find such elements and move the boundaries such that</br>
they do not fall in the middle of one.</br>
Each function is called with two arguments (START and END) and it should return</br>
either a cons (NEW-START . NEW-END) or nil if no adjustment should be made.</br>
These functions are run in turn repeatedly until they all return nil.</br>
Put first the functions more likely to cause a change and cheaper to compute.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
