Mode-specific function to apply `syntax-table' text properties.<br/>
The value of this variable is a function to be called by Font<br/>
Lock mode, prior to performing syntactic fontification on a<br/>
stretch of text.  It is given two arguments, START and END: the<br/>
start and end of the text to be fontified.  Major modes can<br/>
specify a custom function to apply `syntax-table' properties to<br/>
override the default syntax table in special cases.<br/>
<br/>
The specified function may call `syntax-ppss' on any position<br/>
before END, but it should not call `syntax-ppss-flush-cache',<br/>
which means that it should not call `syntax-ppss' on some<br/>
position and later modify the buffer on some earlier position.
