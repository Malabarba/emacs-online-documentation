<strong>tab-always-indent</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>indent.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Controls the operation of the TAB key.<br/>
If t, hitting TAB always just indents the current line.<br/>
If nil, hitting TAB indents the current line if point is at the left margin<br/>
or in the line's indentation, otherwise it inserts a "real" TAB character.<br/>
If `complete', TAB first tries to indent the current line, and if the line<br/>
was already indented, then try to complete the thing at point.<br/>
<br/>
Some programming language modes have their own variable to control this,<br/>
e.g., `c-tab-always-indent', and do not respect this variable.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
