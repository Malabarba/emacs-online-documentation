<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of tab stop positions used by `tab-to-tab-stop'.</br>
This should be nil, or a list of integers, ordered from smallest to largest.</br>
It implicitly extends to infinity through repetition of the last step.</br>
For example, '(1 2 5) is equivalent to '(1 2 5 8 11 ...).  If the list has</br>
fewer than 2 elements, `tab-width' is used as the "last step".</br>
A value of nil means a tab stop every `tab-width' columns.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
