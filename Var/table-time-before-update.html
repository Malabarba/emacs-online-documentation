Documentation:<br/>
Time in seconds before updating the cell contents after typing.<br/>
Updating the cell contents on the screen takes place only after this<br/>
specified amount of time has passed after the last modification to the<br/>
cell contents.  When the contents of a table cell changes repetitively<br/>
and frequently the updating the cell contents on the screen is<br/>
deferred until at least this specified amount of quiet time passes.  A<br/>
smaller number wastes more computation resource by unnecessarily<br/>
frequent screen update.  A large number presents noticeable and<br/>
annoying delay before the typed result start appearing on the screen.<br/>
