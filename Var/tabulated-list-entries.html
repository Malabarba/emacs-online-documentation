tabulated-list-entries is a variable defined in `tabulated-list.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes permanently buffer-local when set.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Entries displayed in the current Tabulated List buffer.<br/>This should be either a function, or a list.<br/>If a list, each element has the form (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]),<br/>where:<br/> - ID is nil, or a Lisp object uniquely identifying this entry,<br/>   which is used to keep the cursor on the "same" entry when<br/>   rearranging the list.  Comparison is done with `equal'.<br/><br/> - Each DESC is a column descriptor, one for each column<br/>   specified in `tabulated-list-format'.  A descriptor is either<br/>   a string, which is printed as-is, or a list (LABEL . PROPS),<br/>   which means to use `insert-text-button' to insert a text<br/>   button with label LABEL and button properties PROPS.<br/>   The string, or button label, must not contain any newline.<br/><br/>If `tabulated-list-entries' is a function, it is called with no<br/>arguments and must return a list of the above form.
