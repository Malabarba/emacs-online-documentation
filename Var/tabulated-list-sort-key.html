<strong>tabulated-list-sort-key</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>tabulated-list.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes permanently buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Sort key for the current Tabulated List mode buffer.<br/>
If nil, no additional sorting is performed.<br/>
Otherwise, this should be a cons cell (NAME . FLIP).<br/>
NAME is a string matching one of the column names in<br/>
`tabulated-list-format' (the corresponding SORT entry in<br/>
`tabulated-list-format' then specifies how to sort).  FLIP, if<br/>
non-nil, means to invert the resulting sort.
