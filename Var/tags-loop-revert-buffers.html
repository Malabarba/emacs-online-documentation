<strong>tags-loop-revert-buffers</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>etags.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means tags-scanning loops should offer to reread changed files.</br>
These loops normally read each file into Emacs, but when a file</br>
is already visited, they use the existing buffer.</br>
When this flag is non-nil, they offer to revert the existing buffer</br>
in the case where the file has changed since you visited it.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
