List of tags tables to search, computed from `tags-table-list'.<br/>
This includes tables implicitly included by other tables.  The list is not<br/>
always complete: the included tables of a table are not known until that<br/>
table is read into core.  An element that is t is a placeholder<br/>
indicating that the preceding element is a table that has not been read<br/>
into core and might contain included tables to search.<br/>
