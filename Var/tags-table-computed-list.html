List of tags tables to search, computed from `tags-table-list'.</br>
This includes tables implicitly included by other tables.  The list is not</br>
always complete: the included tables of a table are not known until that</br>
table is read into core.  An element that is t is a placeholder</br>
indicating that the preceding element is a table that has not been read</br>
into core and might contain included tables to search.</br>
