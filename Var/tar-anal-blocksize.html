Its value is 20<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The blocksize of tar files written by Emacs, or nil, meaning don't care.<br/>
The blocksize of a tar file is not really the size of the blocks; rather, it is<br/>
the number of blocks written with one system call.  When tarring to a tape,<br/>
this is the size of the *tape* blocks, but when writing to a file, it doesn't<br/>
matter much.  The only noticeable difference is that if a tar file does not<br/>
have a blocksize of 20, tar will tell you that; all this really controls is<br/>
how many null padding bytes go on the end of the tar file.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
