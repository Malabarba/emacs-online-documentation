The blocksize of tar files written by Emacs, or nil, meaning don't care.</br>
The blocksize of a tar file is not really the size of the blocks; rather, it is</br>
the number of blocks written with one system call.  When tarring to a tape,</br>
this is the size of the *tape* blocks, but when writing to a file, it doesn't</br>
matter much.  The only noticeable difference is that if a tar file does not</br>
have a blocksize of 20, tar will tell you that; all this really controls is</br>
how many null padding bytes go on the end of the tar file.</br>
