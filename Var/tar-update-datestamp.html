<strong>tar-update-datestamp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>tar-mode.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means Tar mode should play fast and loose with sub-file datestamps.</br>
If this is true, then editing and saving a tar file entry back into its</br>
tar file will update its datestamp.  If false, the datestamp is unchanged.</br>
You may or may not want this - it is good in that you can tell when a file</br>
in a tar archive has been changed, but it is bad for the same reason that</br>
editing a file in the tar archive at all is bad - the changed version of</br>
the file never exists on disk.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
