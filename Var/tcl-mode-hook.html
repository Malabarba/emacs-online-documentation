information):<br/>
<br/>
  `tcl-guess-application'<br/>
    Guesses a default setting for `tcl-application' based on any<br/>
    "#!" line at the top of the file.<br/>
  `tcl-hashify-buffer'<br/>
    Quotes all "#" characters that don't correspond to actual<br/>
    Tcl comments.  (Useful when editing code not originally created<br/>
    with this mode).<br/>
  `tcl-auto-fill-mode'<br/>
    Auto-filling of Tcl comments.<br/>
<br/>
