Its value is shown <a href="#value">below</a>.</br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Maximum height of a window displaying a temporary buffer.</br>
This is effective only when Temp Buffer Resize mode is enabled.</br>
The value is the maximum height (in lines) which</br>
`resize-temp-buffer-window' will give to a window displaying a</br>
temporary buffer.  It can also be a function to be called to</br>
choose the height for such a buffer.  It gets one argument, the</br>
buffer, and should return a positive integer.  At the time the</br>
function is called, the window to be resized is selected.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
