<strong>tempo-match-finder</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>tempo.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "\\b\\([[:word:]]+\\)\\="<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The regexp or function used to find the string to match against tags.<br/>
<br/>
If `tempo-match-finder' is a string, it should contain a regular<br/>
expression with at least one \( \) pair.  When searching for tags,<br/>
`tempo-complete-tag' calls `re-search-backward' with this string, and<br/>
the string between the first \( and \) is used for matching against<br/>
each string in the tag list. If one is found, the whole text between<br/>
the first \( and the point is replaced with the inserted template.<br/>
<br/>
You will probably want to include \= at the end of the regexp to<br/>
make sure that the string is matched only against text adjacent to the<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
If `tempo-match-finder' is a symbol, it should be a function that<br/>
returns a pair of the form (STRING . POS), where STRING is the string<br/>
used for matching and POS is the buffer position after which text<br/>
should be replaced with a template.
