<strong>term-setup-hook</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>startup.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul><li>  <strong>This variable is obsolete since 24.4;</br>
  use either `emacs-startup-hook' or `tty-setup-hook' instead.</strong></li><li>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Normal hook run immediately after `emacs-startup-hook'.</br>
In new code, there is no reason to use this instead of `emacs-startup-hook'.</br>
If you want to execute terminal-specific Lisp code, for example</br>
to override the definitions made by the terminal-specific file,</br>
see `tty-setup-hook'.
