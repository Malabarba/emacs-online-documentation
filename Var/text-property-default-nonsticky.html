Alist of properties vs the corresponding non-stickiness.<br/>
Each element has the form (PROPERTY . NONSTICKINESS).<br/>
<br/>
If a character in a buffer has PROPERTY, new text inserted adjacent to<br/>
the character doesn't inherit PROPERTY if NONSTICKINESS is non-nil,<br/>
inherits it if NONSTICKINESS is nil.  The `front-sticky' and<br/>
`rear-nonsticky' properties of the character override NONSTICKINESS.
