<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A function calling a callback on portions of the buffer to tildify.</br>
</br>
The function is called from `tildify-buffer' function with three arguments: FUNC</br>
BEG END.  FUNC is a callback accepting two arguments -- REG-BEG REG-END --</br>
specifying a portion of buffer to operate on.</br>
</br>
The BEG and END arguments may be used to limit portion of the buffer being</br>
scanned, but the `tildify-foreach-region-function' is not required to make use</br>
of them.  IT must, however, terminate as soon as FUNC returns nil.</br>
</br>
For example, if `tildify-buffer' function should operate on the whole buffer,</br>
a simple pass through function could be used:</br>
    (setq-local tildify-foreach-region-function</br>
                (lambda (cb beg end) (funcall cb beg end)))</br>
or better still:</br>
    (setq-local tildify-foreach-region-function 'funcall)</br>
See `tildify-foreach-ignore-environments' function for other ways to use the</br>
variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
