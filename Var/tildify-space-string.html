Representation of a hard (a.k.a. no-break) space in current major mode.</br>
</br>
Used by `tildify-buffer' in places where space is required but line</br>
cannot be broken.  For example "~" for TeX or "&#160;" for SGML,</br>
HTML and XML modes.  A no-break space Unicode character ("\u00A0")</br>
might be used for other modes if compatible encoding is used.</br>
</br>
If nil, current major mode has no way to represent a hard space.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
