<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Warn about soon-to-be-unsupported forms in `time-stamp-format'.<br/>
If nil, these warnings are disabled, which would be a bad idea!<br/>
You really need to update your files instead.<br/>
<br/>
The new formats will work with old versions of Emacs.<br/>
New formats are being recommended now to allow `time-stamp-format'<br/>
to change in the future to be compatible with `format-time-string'.<br/>
The new forms being recommended now will continue to work then.
