Warn about soon-to-be-unsupported forms in `time-stamp-format'.</br>
If nil, these warnings are disabled, which would be a bad idea!</br>
You really need to update your files instead.</br>
</br>
The new formats will work with old versions of Emacs.</br>
New formats are being recommended now to allow `time-stamp-format'</br>
to change in the future to be compatible with `format-time-string'.</br>
The new forms being recommended now will continue to work then.
