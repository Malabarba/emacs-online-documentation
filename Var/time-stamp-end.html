Regexp marking the text after the time stamp.</br>
M-x time-stamp deletes the text between the first match of `time-stamp-start'</br>
and the following match of `time-stamp-end', then writes the</br>
time stamp specified by `time-stamp-format' between them.</br>
</br>
This value can also be set with the variable `time-stamp-pattern'.</br>
</br>
The end text normally starts on the same line as the start text ends,</br>
but if there are any newlines in `time-stamp-format', the same number</br>
of newlines must separate the start and end.  M-x time-stamp tries</br>
to not change the number of lines in the buffer.  `time-stamp-inserts-lines'</br>
controls this behavior.</br>
</br>
Do not change `time-stamp-start', `time-stamp-end', `time-stamp-pattern',</br>
or `time-stamp-inserts-lines' for yourself or you will be incompatible</br>
with other people's files!  If you must change them for some application,</br>
do so in the local variables section of the time-stamped file itself.
