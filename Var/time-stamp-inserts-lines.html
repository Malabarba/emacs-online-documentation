Whether M-x time-stamp can change the number of lines in a file.</br>
If nil, M-x time-stamp skips as many lines as there are newlines in</br>
`time-stamp-format' before looking for the `time-stamp-end' pattern,</br>
thus it tries not to change the number of lines in the buffer.</br>
If non-nil, M-x time-stamp starts looking for the end pattern</br>
immediately after the start pattern.  This behavior can cause</br>
unexpected changes in the buffer if used carelessly, but it is useful</br>
for generating repeated time stamps.</br>
</br>
Do not change `time-stamp-end' or `time-stamp-inserts-lines' for</br>
yourself or you will be incompatible with other people's files!</br>
If you must change them for some application, do so in the local</br>
variables section of the time-stamped file itself.
