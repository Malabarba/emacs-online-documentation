Whether M-x time-stamp can change the number of lines in a file.<br/>
If nil, M-x time-stamp skips as many lines as there are newlines in<br/>
`time-stamp-format' before looking for the `time-stamp-end' pattern,<br/>
thus it tries not to change the number of lines in the buffer.<br/>
If non-nil, M-x time-stamp starts looking for the end pattern<br/>
immediately after the start pattern.  This behavior can cause<br/>
unexpected changes in the buffer if used carelessly, but it is useful<br/>
for generating repeated time stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Do not change `time-stamp-end' or `time-stamp-inserts-lines' for<br/>
yourself or you will be incompatible with other people's files!<br/>
If you must change them for some application, do so in the local<br/>
variables section of the time-stamped file itself.
