time-stamp-line-limit is a variable defined in `time-stamp.el'.<br/>Its value is 8<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `integerp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Lines of a file searched; positive counts from start, negative from end.<br/>The patterns `time-stamp-start' and `time-stamp-end' must be found in<br/>the first (last) `time-stamp-line-limit' lines of the file for the<br/>file to be time-stamped by M-x time-stamp.  A value of 0 searches the<br/>entire buffer (use with care).<br/><br/>This value can also be set with the variable `time-stamp-pattern'.<br/><br/>Do not change `time-stamp-line-limit', `time-stamp-start',<br/>`time-stamp-end', or `time-stamp-pattern' for yourself or you will be<br/>incompatible with other people's files!  If you must change them for some<br/>application, do so in the local variables section of the time-stamped file<br/>itself.
