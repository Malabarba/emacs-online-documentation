<strong>time-stamp-pattern</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>time-stamp.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>
  satisfies the predicate `stringp'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Convenience variable setting all `time-stamp' location and format values.<br/>
This string has four parts, each of which is optional.<br/>
These four parts set `time-stamp-line-limit', `time-stamp-start',<br/>
`time-stamp-format', and `time-stamp-end'.  See the documentation<br/>
for each of these variables for details.<br/>
<br/>
The first part is a number followed by a slash; the number sets the number<br/>
of lines at the beginning (negative counts from end) of the file searched<br/>
for the time stamp.  The number and the slash may be omitted to use the<br/>
normal value.<br/>
<br/>
The second part is a regexp identifying the pattern preceding the time stamp.<br/>
This part may be omitted to use the normal pattern.<br/>
<br/>
The third part specifies the format of the time stamp inserted.  See<br/>
the documentation for `time-stamp-format' for details.  Specify this<br/>
part as "%%" to use the normal format.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth part is a regexp identifying the pattern following the time stamp.<br/>
This part may be omitted to use the normal pattern.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
"-10/"<br/>
"-9/^Last modified: %%$"<br/>
"@set Time-stamp: %:b %:d, %:y$"<br/>
"newcommand{\\\\timestamp}{%%}"<br/>
<br/>
Do not change `time-stamp-pattern' `time-stamp-line-limit',<br/>
`time-stamp-start', or `time-stamp-end' for yourself or you will be<br/>
incompatible with other people's files!  If you must change them for<br/>
some application, do so only in the local variables section of the<br/>
time-stamped file itself.
