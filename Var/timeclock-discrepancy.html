timeclock-discrepancy is a variable defined in `timeclock.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A variable containing the time discrepancy before the last event.<br/>Normally, timeclock assumes that you intend to work for<br/>`timeclock-workday' seconds every day.  Any days in which you work<br/>more or less than this amount is considered either a positive or<br/>a negative discrepancy.  If you work in such a manner that the<br/>discrepancy is always brought back to zero, then you will by<br/>definition have worked an average amount equal to `timeclock-workday'<br/>each day.
