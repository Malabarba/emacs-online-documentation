A variable containing the time discrepancy before the last event.</br>
Normally, timeclock assumes that you intend to work for</br>
`timeclock-workday' seconds every day.  Any days in which you work</br>
more or less than this amount is considered either a positive or</br>
a negative discrepancy.  If you work in such a manner that the</br>
discrepancy is always brought back to zero, then you will by</br>
definition have worked an average amount equal to `timeclock-workday'</br>
each day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
