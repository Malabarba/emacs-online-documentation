<strong>timeclock-elapsed</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>timeclock.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
A variable containing the time elapsed for complete periods today.<br/>
This value is not accurate enough to be useful by itself.  Rather,<br/>
call `timeclock-workday-elapsed', to determine how much time has been<br/>
worked so far today.  Also, if `timeclock-relative' is nil, this value<br/>
will be the same as `timeclock-discrepancy'.
