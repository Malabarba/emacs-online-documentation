A function used to determine the length of today's workday.</br>
The first time that a user clocks in each day, this function will be</br>
called to determine what is the length of the current workday.  If</br>
the return value is nil, or equal to `timeclock-workday', nothing special</br>
will be done.  If it is a quantity different from `timeclock-workday',</br>
however, a record will be output to the timelog file to note the fact that</br>
that day has a length that is different from the norm.</br>
