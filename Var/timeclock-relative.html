<strong>timeclock-relative</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>timeclock.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Whether to make reported time relative to `timeclock-workday'.<br/>
For example, if the length of a normal workday is eight hours, and you<br/>
work four hours on Monday, then the amount of time "remaining" on<br/>
Tuesday is twelve hours -- relative to an averaged work period of<br/>
eight hours -- or eight hours, non-relative.  So relative time takes<br/>
into account any discrepancy of time under-worked or over-worked on<br/>
previous days.  This only affects the timeclock mode line display.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
