<strong>timeclock-use-display-time</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>timeclock.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If non-nil, use `display-time-hook' for doing mode line updates.<br/>
The advantage of this is that one less timer has to be set running<br/>
amok in Emacs's process space.  The disadvantage is that it requires<br/>
you to have `display-time' running.  If you don't want to use<br/>
`display-time', but still want the mode line to show how much time is<br/>
left, set this variable to nil.  Changing the value of this variable<br/>
while timeclock information is being displayed in the mode line has no<br/>
effect.  You should call the function `timeclock-mode-line-display' with<br/>
a positive argument to force an update.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
