<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Maximum number of times to repeat a timer, if many repeats are delayed.</br>
Timer invocations can be delayed because Emacs is suspended or busy,</br>
or because the system's time changes.  If such an occurrence makes it</br>
appear that many invocations are overdue, this variable controls</br>
how many will really happen.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
