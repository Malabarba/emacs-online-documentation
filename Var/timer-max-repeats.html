Its value is 10<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Maximum number of times to repeat a timer, if many repeats are delayed.<br/>
Timer invocations can be delayed because Emacs is suspended or busy,<br/>
or because the system's time changes.  If such an occurrence makes it<br/>
appear that many invocations are overdue, this variable controls<br/>
how many will really happen.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
