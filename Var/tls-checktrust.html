<strong>tls-checktrust</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>tls.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Indicate if certificates should be checked against trusted root certs.</br>
If this is `ask', the user can decide whether to accept an</br>
untrusted certificate.  You may have to adapt `tls-program' in</br>
order to make this feature work properly, i.e., to ensure that</br>
the external program knows about the root certificates you</br>
consider trustworthy, e.g.:</br>
</br>
(setq tls-program</br>
      '("gnutls-cli --x509cafile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt -p %p %h"</br>
	"gnutls-cli --x509cafile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt -p %p %h --protocols ssl3"</br>
	"openssl s_client -connect %h:%p -CAfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt -no_ssl2 -ign_eof"))</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
