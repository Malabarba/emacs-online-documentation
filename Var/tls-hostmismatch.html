Regular expression indicating a host name mismatch in certificate.</br>
When the host name specified in the certificate doesn't match the</br>
name of the host you are connecting to, gnutls-cli issues a</br>
warning to this effect.  There is no such feature in openssl.  Set</br>
this to nil if you want to ignore host name mismatches.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
