Documentation:<br/>
TODO mode insertion accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
If you have 8 items in your TODO list, then you may get asked 4<br/>
questions by the binary insertion algorithm.  However, you may not<br/>
really have a need for such accurate priorities amongst your TODO<br/>
items.  If you now think about the binary insertion halving the size<br/>
of the window each time, then the threshold is the window size at<br/>
which it will stop.  If you set the threshold to zero, the upper and<br/>
lower bound will coincide at the end of the loop and you will insert<br/>
your item just before that point.  If you set the threshold to,<br/>
e.g. 8, it will stop as soon as the window size drops below that<br/>
amount and will insert the item in the approximate center of that<br/>
window.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
