<strong>todo-prefix</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>todo-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "*/*"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
TODO mode prefix for entries.<br/>
<br/>
This is useful in conjunction with `calendar' and `diary' if you use<br/>
<br/>
#include "~/.todo-do"<br/>
<br/>
in your diary file to include your todo list file as part of your<br/>
diary.  With the default value "*/*" the diary displays each entry<br/>
every day and it may also be marked on every day of the calendar.<br/>
Using "&%%(equal (calendar-current-date) date)" instead will only<br/>
show and mark todo entries for today, but may slow down processing of<br/>
the diary file somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
