This section can be accessed through the standard\n  Emacs help facility using the `p' option.  Once you exit TPU-edt Help, one\n  of the following key sequences is sure to get you there.\n\n    ^h p        if you're not yet using TPU-edt\n    Gold-PF2 p  if you're using TPU-edt\n\n  Alternatively, fire up Emacs help from the command prompt, with\n\n    M-x help-for-help <CR> p <CR>\n\n  Where `M-x' might be any of `Gold-KP7', 'Do', or 'ESC-x'.\n\n  When you successfully invoke this part of the Emacs help facility, you\n  will see a buffer named `*Finder*' listing a number of topics.  Look for\n  tpu-edt under `emulations'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n   *** No more help, use P to view previous screen"</pre></br>
