Non-nil means vertical motion starting at end of line keeps to ends of lines.</br>
This means moving to the end of each line moved onto.</br>
The beginning of a blank line does not count as the end of a line.</br>
This has no effect when the variable `line-move-visual' is non-nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
