<strong>tramp-completion-mode</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>tramp.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, external packages signal that they are in file name completion.</br>
</br>
This is necessary, because Tramp uses a heuristic depending on last</br>
input event.  This fails when external packages use other characters</br>
but <TAB>, <SPACE> or ?\? for file name completion.  This variable</br>
should never be set globally, the intention is to let-bind it.
