Defines seconds since last remote command before rereading a directory.</br>
A remote directory might have changed its contents.  In order to</br>
make it visible during file name completion in the minibuffer,</br>
Tramp flushes its cache and rereads the directory contents when</br>
more than `tramp-completion-reread-directory-timeout' seconds</br>
have been gone since last remote command execution.  A value of `t'</br>
would require an immediate reread during filename completion, `nil'</br>
means to use always cached values for the directory contents.</br>
</br>
