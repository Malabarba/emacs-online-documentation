Defines seconds between two consecutive connection attempts.</br>
This is necessary as self defense mechanism, in order to avoid</br>
yo-yo connection attempts when the remote host is unavailable.</br>
</br>
A value of 0 or `nil' suppresses this check.  This might be</br>
necessary, when several out-of-order copy operations are</br>
performed, or when several asynchronous processes will be started</br>
in a short time frame.  In those cases it is recommended to</br>
let-bind this variable.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
