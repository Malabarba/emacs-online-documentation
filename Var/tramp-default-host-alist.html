Default host to use for specific method/user pairs.</br>
This is an alist of items (METHOD USER HOST).  The first matching item</br>
specifies the host to use for a file name which does not specify a</br>
host.  METHOD and HOST are regular expressions or nil, which is</br>
interpreted as a regular expression which always matches.  If no entry</br>
matches, the variable `tramp-default-host' takes effect.</br>
</br>
If the file name does not specify the method, lookup is done using the</br>
empty string for the method name.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
