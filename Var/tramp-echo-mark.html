String mark to be transmitted around shell commands.</br>
Used to separate their echo from the output they produce.  This</br>
will only be used if we cannot disable remote echo via stty.</br>
This string must have no effect on the remote shell except for</br>
producing some echo which can later be detected by</br>
`tramp-echoed-echo-mark-regexp'.  Using `tramp-echo-mark-marker',</br>
followed by an equal number of backspaces to erase them will</br>
usually suffice.
