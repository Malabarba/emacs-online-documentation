Regular expression matching file names handled by Tramp.</br>
This regexp should match Tramp file names but no other file names.</br>
When tramp.el is loaded, this regular expression is prepended to</br>
`file-name-handler-alist', and that is searched sequentially.  Thus,</br>
if the Tramp entry appears rather early in the `file-name-handler-alist'</br>
and is a bit too general, then some files might be considered Tramp</br>
files which are not really Tramp files.</br>
</br>
Please note that the entry in `file-name-handler-alist' is made when</br>
this file (tramp.el) is loaded.  This means that this variable must be set</br>
before loading tramp.el.  Alternatively, `file-name-handler-alist' can be</br>
updated after changing this variable.</br>
