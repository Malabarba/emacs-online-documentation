tramp-file-name-structure is a variable defined in `tramp.el'.<br/>Its value is<br/>("^/\\(\\(?:\\(?:\\([a-zA-Z_0-9-]+\\):\\)?\\(?:\\([^/|: 	]+\\)@\\)?\\(\\(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+\\|\\[\\(?:\\(?:[a-zA-Z0-9]+\\)?:\\)+[a-zA-Z0-9.]+]\\)\\(?:#[0-9]+\\)?\\)?|\\)+\\)?\\(?:\\([a-zA-Z_0-9-]+\\):\\)?\\(?:\\([^/|: 	]+\\)@\\)?\\(\\(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+\\|\\[\\(?:\\(?:[a-zA-Z0-9]+\\)?:\\)+[a-zA-Z0-9.]+]\\)\\(?:#[0-9]+\\)?\\)?:\\(.*$\\)" 5 6 7 8 1)<br/><br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of six elements (REGEXP METHOD USER HOST FILE HOP), detailing the Tramp file name structure.<br/><br/>The first element REGEXP is a regular expression matching a Tramp file<br/>name.  The regex should contain parentheses around the method name,<br/>the user name, the host name, and the file name parts.<br/><br/>The second element METHOD is a number, saying which pair of<br/>parentheses matches the method name.  The third element USER is<br/>similar, but for the user name.  The fourth element HOST is similar,<br/>but for the host name.  The fifth element FILE is for the file name.<br/>The last element HOP is the ad-hoc hop definition, which could be a<br/>cascade of several hops.<br/><br/>These numbers are passed directly to `match-string', which see.  That<br/>means the opening parentheses are counted to identify the pair.<br/><br/>See also `tramp-file-name-regexp'.
