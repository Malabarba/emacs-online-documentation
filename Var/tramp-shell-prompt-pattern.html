Regexp to match prompts from remote shell.</br>
Normally, Tramp expects you to configure `shell-prompt-pattern'</br>
correctly, but sometimes it happens that you are connecting to a</br>
remote host which sends a different kind of shell prompt.  Therefore,</br>
Tramp recognizes things matched by `shell-prompt-pattern' as prompt,</br>
and also things matched by this variable.  The default value of this</br>
variable is similar to the default value of `shell-prompt-pattern',</br>
which should work well in many cases.</br>
</br>
This regexp must match both `tramp-initial-end-of-output' and</br>
`tramp-end-of-output'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
