Prefix to use for temporary files.</br>
If this is a relative file name (such as "tramp."), it is considered</br>
relative to the directory name returned by the function</br>
`tramp-compat-temporary-file-directory' (which see).  It may also be an</br>
absolute file name; don't forget to include a prefix for the filename</br>
part, though.
