Lisp programs may give this variable certain special values:<br/>
<br/>
- A value of `lambda' enables Transient Mark mode temporarily.<br/>
  It is disabled again after any subsequent action that would<br/>
  normally deactivate the mark (e.g. buffer modification).<br/>
<br/>
- A value of (only . OLDVAL) enables Transient Mark mode<br/>
  temporarily.  After any subsequent point motion command that is<br/>
  not shift-translated, or any other action that would normally<br/>
  deactivate the mark (e.g. buffer modification), the value of<br/>
  `transient-mark-mode' is set to OLDVAL.<br/>
