Directory for `move-file-to-trash' to move files and directories to.</br>
This directory is only used when the function `system-move-file-to-trash'</br>
is not defined.</br>
Relative paths are interpreted relative to `default-directory'.</br>
If the value is nil, Emacs uses a freedesktop.org-style trashcan.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.2 of Emacs.
