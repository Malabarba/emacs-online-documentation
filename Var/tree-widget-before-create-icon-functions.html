Hooks run before to create a tree-widget icon.<br/>
Each function is passed the icon widget not yet created.<br/>
The value of the icon widget :node property is a tree :node widget or<br/>
a leaf node widget, not yet created.<br/>
This hook can be used to dynamically change properties of the icon and<br/>
associated node widgets.  For example, to dynamically change the look<br/>
and feel of the tree-widget by changing the values of the :tag<br/>
and :glyph-name properties of the icon widget.<br/>
This hook should be local in the buffer setup to display widgets.
