Non-nil means do not display continuation lines.</br>
Instead, give each line of text just one screen line.</br>

Note that this is overridden by the variable</br>
`truncate-partial-width-windows' if that variable is non-nil</br>
and this buffer is not full-frame width.</br>
</br>
Minibuffers set this variable to nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
