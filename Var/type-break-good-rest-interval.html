<strong>type-break-good-rest-interval</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>type-break.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>600</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Number of seconds of idle time considered to be an adequate typing rest.</br>
</br>
When this variable is non-nil, Emacs checks the idle time between</br>
keystrokes.  If this idle time is long enough to be considered a "good"</br>
rest from typing, then the next typing break is simply rescheduled for later.</br>
</br>
If a break is interrupted before this much time elapses, the user will be</br>
asked whether or not really to interrupt the break.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
