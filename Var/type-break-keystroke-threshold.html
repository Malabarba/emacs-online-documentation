type-break-keystroke-threshold is a variable defined in `type-break.el'.<br/>Its value is (2100 . 10500)<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Upper and lower bound on number of keystrokes for considering typing break.<br/>This structure is a pair of numbers (MIN . MAX).<br/><br/>The first number is the minimum number of keystrokes that must have been<br/>entered since the last typing break before considering another one, even if<br/>the scheduled time has elapsed; the break is simply rescheduled until later<br/>if the minimum threshold hasn't been reached.  If this first value is nil,<br/>then there is no minimum threshold; as soon as the scheduled time has<br/>elapsed, the user will always be queried.<br/><br/>The second number is the maximum number of keystrokes that can be entered<br/>before a typing break is requested immediately, pre-empting the originally<br/>scheduled break.  If this second value is nil, then no pre-emptive breaks<br/>will occur; only scheduled ones will.<br/><br/>Keys with bucky bits (shift, control, meta, etc) are counted as only one<br/>keystroke even though they really require multiple keys to generate them.<br/><br/>The command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' can be used to<br/>guess a reasonably good pair of values for this variable.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
