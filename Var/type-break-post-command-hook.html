Hook run indirectly by `post-command-hook' for typing break functions.</br>
This is not really intended to be set by the user, but it's probably</br>
harmless to do so.  Mainly it is used by various parts of the typing break</br>
program to delay actions until after the user has completed some command.</br>
It exists because `post-command-hook' itself is inaccessible while its</br>
functions are being run, and some type-break--related functions want to</br>
remove themselves after running.
