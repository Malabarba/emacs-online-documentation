<strong>uce-message-text</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>uce.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre></br>
"Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.\nI do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending\nunsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for\nreading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying\nand not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.\n\nIf you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or\nservices you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not\nbuy from you.\n\nIf you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to,\nREMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list\njust empty.\n\n	----------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are not an administrator of any site and still have received\nthis message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.\nThey fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,\nyou might want to show this message to your system administrator, and\nask him/her to investigate this matter.\n\nNote to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to\nthis message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.\nThis message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is\nmentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be\nfaked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way\nyou might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the\npostmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If\nmessage was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when\nthis message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope\nrather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was\nusing your sendmail at this moment of time.\n\nThank you."</pre></br>

This is the text that `uce-reply-to-uce' command will put in reply buffer.</br>
Some of spamming programs in use will be set up to read all incoming</br>
to spam address email, and will remove people who put the word `remove'</br>
on beginning of some line from the spamming list.  So, when you set it</br>
up, it might be a good idea to actually use this feature.</br>
</br>
Value nil means insert no text by default, lets you type it in.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
