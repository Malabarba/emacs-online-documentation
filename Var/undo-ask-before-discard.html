<strong>undo-ask-before-discard</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil ask about discarding undo info for the current command.</br>
Normally, Emacs discards the undo info for the current command if</br>
it exceeds `undo-outer-limit'.  But if you set this option</br>
non-nil, it asks in the echo area whether to discard the info.</br>
If you answer no, there is a slight risk that Emacs might crash, so</br>
only do it if you really want to undo the command.</br>
</br>
This option is mainly intended for debugging.  You have to be</br>
careful if you use it for other purposes.  Garbage collection is</br>
inhibited while the question is asked, meaning that Emacs might</br>
leak memory.  So you should make sure that you do not wait</br>
excessively long before answering the question.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
