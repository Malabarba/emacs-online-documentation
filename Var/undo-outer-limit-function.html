Function to call when an undo list exceeds `undo-outer-limit'.<br/>
This function is called with one argument, the current undo list size<br/>
for the most recent command (since the last undo boundary).<br/>
If the function returns t, that means truncation has been fully handled.<br/>
If it returns nil, the other forms of truncation are done.<br/>
<br/>
Garbage collection is inhibited around the call to this function,<br/>
so it must make sure not to do a lot of consing.
