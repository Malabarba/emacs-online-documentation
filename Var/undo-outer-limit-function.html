Function to call when an undo list exceeds `undo-outer-limit'.</br>
This function is called with one argument, the current undo list size</br>
for the most recent command (since the last undo boundary).</br>
If the function returns t, that means truncation has been fully handled.</br>
If it returns nil, the other forms of truncation are done.</br>
</br>
Garbage collection is inhibited around the call to this function,</br>
so it must make sure not to do a lot of consing.
