<strong>undo-outer-limit</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
Original value was 12000000<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Outer limit on size of undo information for one command.<br/>
At garbage collection time, if the current command has produced<br/>
more than this much undo information, it discards the info and displays<br/>
a warning.  This is a last-ditch limit to prevent memory overflow.<br/>
<br/>
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied, which includes<br/>
both saved text and other data.  A value of nil means no limit.  In<br/>
this case, accumulating one huge undo entry could make Emacs crash as<br/>
a result of memory overflow.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, this calls the function which is the value of<br/>
`undo-outer-limit-function' with one argument, the size.<br/>
The text above describes the behavior of the function<br/>
that variable usually specifies.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 22.1 of Emacs.<br/>
