Outer limit on size of undo information for one command.</br>
At garbage collection time, if the current command has produced</br>
more than this much undo information, it discards the info and displays</br>
a warning.  This is a last-ditch limit to prevent memory overflow.</br>
</br>
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied, which includes</br>
both saved text and other data.  A value of nil means no limit.  In</br>
this case, accumulating one huge undo entry could make Emacs crash as</br>
a result of memory overflow.</br>
</br>
In fact, this calls the function which is the value of</br>
`undo-outer-limit-function' with one argument, the size.</br>
The text above describes the behavior of the function</br>
that variable usually specifies.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.
