<strong>undo-strong-limit</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>120000</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Don't keep more than this much size of undo information.</br>
This limit is applied when garbage collection happens.</br>
When a previous command increases the total undo list size past this</br>
value, that command and the earlier commands that came before it are forgotten.</br>
However, the most recent buffer-modifying command's undo info</br>
is never discarded for this reason.</br>
</br>
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied,</br>
which includes both saved text and other data.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
