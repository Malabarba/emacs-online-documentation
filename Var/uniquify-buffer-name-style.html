Its value is <pre>post-forward-angle-brackets</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, buffer names are uniquified with parts of directory name.</br>
The value determines the buffer name style and is one of `forward',</br>
`reverse', `post-forward', or `post-forward-angle-brackets'.</br>
For example, files `/foo/bar/mumble/name' and `/baz/quux/mumble/name'</br>
would have the following buffer names in the various styles:</br>
  forward        bar/mumble/name  quux/mumble/name</br>
  reverse        name\mumble\bar  name\mumble\quux</br>
  post-forward   name|bar/mumble  name|quux/mumble</br>
  post-forward-angle-brackets   name<bar/mumble>  name<quux/mumble></br>
  nil            name  name<2></br>
Of course, the "mumble" part may be stripped as well, depending on the setting</br>
of `uniquify-strip-common-suffix'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
