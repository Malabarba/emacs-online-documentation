List of events to be read as the command input.</br>
These events are processed first, before actual keyboard input.</br>
Events read from this list are not normally added to `this-command-keys',</br>
as they will already have been added once as they were read for the first time.</br>
An element of the form (t . EVENT) forces EVENT to be added to that list.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
