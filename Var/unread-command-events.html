List of events to be read as the command input.</br>
These events are processed first, before actual keyboard input.</br>
Events read from this list are not normally added to `this-command-keys',</br>
as they will already have been added once as they were read for the first time.</br>
An element of the form (t . EVENT) forces EVENT to be added to that list.
