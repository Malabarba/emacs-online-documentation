The mbox format that `unrmail' should produce.</br>
These formats separate messages using lines that start with "From ".</br>
Therefore any lines in the message bodies that start with "From "</br>
must be quoted.  The `mboxo' format just prepends a ">" to such lines.</br>
This is not reversible, because given a line starting with ">From " in</br>
an mboxo file, it is not possible to know whether the original had a ">"</br>
or not.  The `mboxrd' format avoids this by also quoting ">From " as</br>
">>From ", and so on.  For this reason, mboxrd is recommended.</br>
</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
