<strong>user-init-file</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
File name, including directory, of user's initialization file.</br>
If the file loaded had extension `.elc', and the corresponding source file</br>
exists, this variable contains the name of source file, suitable for use</br>
by functions like `custom-save-all' which edit the init file.</br>
While Emacs loads and evaluates the init file, value is the real name</br>
of the file, regardless of whether or not it has the `.elc' extension.
