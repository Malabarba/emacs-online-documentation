When non-nil, inherit the EOL format for reading Diff output from the file.</br>
</br>
Used in `vc-coding-system-for-diff' to determine the EOL format to use</br>
for reading Diff output for a file.  If non-nil, the EOL format is</br>
inherited from the file itself.</br>
Set this variable to nil if your Diff tool might use a different</br>
EOL.  Then Emacs will auto-detect the EOL format in Diff output, which</br>
gives better results.
