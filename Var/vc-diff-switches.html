<strong>vc-diff-switches</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vc.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
A string or list of strings specifying switches for diff under VC.</br>
When running diff under a given BACKEND, VC uses the first</br>
non-nil value of `vc-BACKEND-diff-switches', `vc-diff-switches',</br>
and `diff-switches', in that order.  Since nil means to check the</br>
next variable in the sequence, either of the first two may use</br>
the value t to mean no switches at all.  `vc-diff-switches'</br>
should contain switches that are specific to version control, but</br>
not specific to any particular backend.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 21.1 of Emacs.
