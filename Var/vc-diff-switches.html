vc-diff-switches is a variable defined in `vc.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A string or list of strings specifying switches for diff under VC.<br/>When running diff under a given BACKEND, VC uses the first<br/>non-nil value of `vc-BACKEND-diff-switches', `vc-diff-switches',<br/>and `diff-switches', in that order.  Since nil means to check the<br/>next variable in the sequence, either of the first two may use<br/>the value t to mean no switches at all.  `vc-diff-switches'<br/>should contain switches that are specific to version control, but<br/>not specific to any particular backend.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 21.1 of Emacs.<br/>
