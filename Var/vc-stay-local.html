vc-stay-local is a variable defined in `vc-hooks.el'.<br/>Its value is only-file<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means use local operations when possible for remote repositories.<br/>This avoids slow queries over the network and instead uses heuristics<br/>and past information to determine the current status of a file.<br/><br/>If value is the symbol `only-file' `vc-dir' will connect to the<br/>server, but heuristics will be used to determine the status for<br/>all other VC operations.<br/><br/>The value can also be a regular expression or list of regular<br/>expressions to match against the host name of a repository; then VC<br/>only stays local for hosts that match it.  Alternatively, the value<br/>can be a list of regular expressions where the first element is the<br/>symbol `except'; then VC always stays local except for hosts matched<br/>by these regular expressions.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 23.1 of Emacs.<br/>
