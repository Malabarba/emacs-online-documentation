<strong>vc-stay-local</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vc-hooks.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>only-file</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means use local operations when possible for remote repositories.</br>
This avoids slow queries over the network and instead uses heuristics</br>
and past information to determine the current status of a file.</br>
</br>
If value is the symbol `only-file', `vc-dir' will connect to the</br>
server, but heuristics will be used to determine the status for</br>
all other VC operations.</br>
</br>
The value can also be a regular expression or list of regular</br>
expressions to match against the host name of a repository; then VC</br>
only stays local for hosts that match it.  Alternatively, the value</br>
can be a list of regular expressions where the first element is the</br>
symbol `except'; then VC always stays local except for hosts matched</br>
by these regular expressions.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 23.1 of Emacs.
