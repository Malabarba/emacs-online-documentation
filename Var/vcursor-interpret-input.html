<strong>vcursor-interpret-input</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vcursor.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, input from the vcursor is treated as interactive input.</br>
This will cause text insertion to be much slower.  Note that no special</br>
interpretation of strings is done: "" is a string of four</br>
characters.  The default is simply to copy strings.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 20.3 of Emacs.
