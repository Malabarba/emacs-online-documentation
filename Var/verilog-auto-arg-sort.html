verilog-auto-arg-sort is a variable defined in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `verilog-booleanp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means AUTOARG signal names will be sorted, not in declaration order.<br/>Declaration order is advantageous with order based instantiations<br/>and is the default for backward compatibility.  Sorted order<br/>reduces changes when declarations are moved around in a file, and<br/>it's bad practice to rely on order based instantiations anyhow.<br/><br/>See also `verilog-auto-inst-sort'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
