Non-nil means AUTOARG signal names will be sorted, not in declaration order.</br>
Declaration order is advantageous with order based instantiations</br>
and is the default for backward compatibility.  Sorted order</br>
reduces changes when declarations are moved around in a file, and</br>
it's bad practice to rely on order based instantiations anyhow.</br>
</br>
See also `verilog-auto-inst-sort'.</br>

You can customize this variable.
