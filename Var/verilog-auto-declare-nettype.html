Non-nil specifies the data type to use with `verilog-auto-input' etc.</br>
Set this to "wire" if the Verilog code uses "`default_nettype</br>
none".  Note using `default_nettype none isn't recommended practice; this</br>
mode is experimental.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
