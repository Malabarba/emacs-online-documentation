<strong>verilog-auto-inst-dot-name</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>
  satisfies the predicate `verilog-booleanp'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means when creating ports with AUTOINST, use .name syntax.<br/>
This will use ".port" instead of ".port(port)" when possible.<br/>
This is only legal in SystemVerilog files, and will confuse older<br/>
simulators.  Setting `verilog-auto-inst-vector' to nil may also<br/>
be desirable to increase how often .name will be used.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
