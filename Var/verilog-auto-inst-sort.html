Non-nil means AUTOINST signals will be sorted, not in declaration order.</br>
Also affects AUTOINSTPARAM.  Declaration order is the default for</br>
backward compatibility, and as some teams prefer signals that are</br>
declared together to remain together.  Sorted order reduces</br>
changes when declarations are moved around in a file.</br>
</br>
See also `verilog-auto-arg-sort'.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
