verilog-auto-inst-template-numbers is a variable defined in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `(lambda (x) (memq x (quote (nil t lhs))))'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If true, when creating templated ports with AUTOINST, add a comment.<br/><br/>If t, the comment will add the line number of the template that<br/>was used for that port declaration.  This setting is suggested<br/>only for debugging use, as regular use may cause a large numbers<br/>of merge conflicts.<br/><br/>If 'lhs', the comment will show the left hand side of the<br/>AUTO_TEMPLATE rule that is matched.  This is less precise than<br/>numbering (t) when multiple rules have the same pin name, but<br/>won't merge conflict.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
