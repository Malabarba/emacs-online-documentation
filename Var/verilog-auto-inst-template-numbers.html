If true, when creating templated ports with AUTOINST, add a comment.</br>
</br>
If t, the comment will add the line number of the template that</br>
was used for that port declaration.  This setting is suggested</br>
only for debugging use, as regular use may cause a large numbers</br>
of merge conflicts.</br>
</br>
If 'lhs', the comment will show the left hand side of the</br>
AUTO_TEMPLATE rule that is matched.  This is less precise than</br>
numbering (t) when multiple rules have the same pin name, but</br>
won't merge conflict.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
