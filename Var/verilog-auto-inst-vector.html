Non-nil means when creating default ports with AUTOINST, use bus subscripts.</br>
If nil, skip the subscript when it matches the entire bus as declared in</br>
the module (AUTOWIRE signals always are subscripted, you must manually</br>
declare the wire to have the subscripts removed.)  Setting this to nil may</br>
speed up some simulators, but is less general and harder to read, so avoid.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
