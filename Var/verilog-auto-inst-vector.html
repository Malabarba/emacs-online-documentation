verilog-auto-inst-vector is a variable defined in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is t<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `verilog-booleanp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means when creating default ports with AUTOINST, use bus subscripts.<br/>If nil, skip the subscript when it matches the entire bus as declared in<br/>the module (AUTOWIRE signals always are subscripted, you must manually<br/>declare the wire to have the subscripts removed.)  Setting this to nil may<br/>speed up some simulators, but is less general and harder to read, so avoid.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
