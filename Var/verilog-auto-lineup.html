<strong>verilog-auto-lineup</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>verilog-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is declarations<br/>
<br/>
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>
  satisfies the predicate `(lambda (x) (memq x (quote (nil all assignments declarations))))'.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Type of statements to lineup across multiple lines.<br/>
If 'all' is selected, then all line ups described below are done.<br/>
<br/>
If 'declaration', then just declarations are lined up with any<br/>
preceding declarations, taking into account widths and the like,<br/>
so or example the code:<br/>
 	reg [31:0] a;<br/>
 	reg b;<br/>
would become<br/>
 	reg [31:0] a;<br/>
 	reg        b;<br/>
<br/>
If 'assignment', then assignments are lined up with any preceding<br/>
assignments, so for example the code<br/>
	a_long_variable <= b + c;<br/>
	d = e + f;<br/>
would become<br/>
	a_long_variable <= b + c;<br/>
	d                = e + f;<br/>
<br/>
In order to speed up editing, large blocks of statements are lined up<br/>
only when a M-x verilog-pretty-expr is typed; and large blocks of declarations<br/>
are lineup only when M-x verilog-pretty-declarations is typed.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
