verilog-auto-read-includes is a variable defined in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `verilog-booleanp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Non-nil means to automatically read includes before AUTOs.<br/>This will do a `verilog-read-defines' and `verilog-read-includes' before<br/>each AUTO expansion.  This makes it easier to embed defines and includes,<br/>but can result in very slow reading times if there are many or large<br/>include files.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
