Non-nil means to automatically read includes before AUTOs.</br>
This will do a `verilog-read-defines' and `verilog-read-includes' before</br>
each AUTO expansion.  This makes it easier to embed defines and includes,</br>
but can result in very slow reading times if there are many or large</br>
include files.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
