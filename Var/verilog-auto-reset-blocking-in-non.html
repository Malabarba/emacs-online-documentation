Non-nil means AUTORESET will reset blocking statements.</br>
When true, AUTORESET will reset in blocking statements those</br>
signals which were assigned with blocking assignments (=) even in</br>
a block with non-blocking assignments (<=).</br>
</br>
If nil, all blocking assigned signals are ignored when any</br>
non-blocking assignment is in the AUTORESET block.  This allows</br>
blocking assignments to be used for temporary values and not have</br>
those temporaries reset.  See example in `verilog-auto-reset'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
