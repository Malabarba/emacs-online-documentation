Non-nil means AUTOSENSE should assume all defines represent constants.</br>
When true, the defines will not be included in sensitivity lists.  To</br>
maintain compatibility with other sites, this should be set at the bottom</br>
of each Verilog file that requires it, rather than being set globally.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
