verilog-library-directories is a variable defined in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is (".")<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `listp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of directories when looking for files for /*AUTOINST*/.<br/>The directory may be relative to the current file, or absolute.<br/>Environment variables are also expanded in the directory names.<br/>Having at least the current directory is a good idea.<br/><br/>You might want these defined in each file; put at the *END* of your file<br/>something like:<br/><br/>    // Local Variables:<br/>    // verilog-library-directories:("." "subdir" "subdir2")<br/>    // End:<br/><br/>Verilog-mode attempts to detect changes to this local variable, but they<br/>are only insured to be correct when the file is first visited.  Thus if you<br/>have problems, use C-x C-v RET to have these take effect.<br/><br/>See also `verilog-library-flags', `verilog-library-files'<br/>and `verilog-library-extensions'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
