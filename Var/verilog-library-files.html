verilog-library-files is a variable defined in `verilog-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value<br/>  satisfies the predicate `listp'.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of files to search for modules.<br/>AUTOINST will use this when it needs to resolve a module name.<br/>This is a complete path, usually to a technology file with many standard<br/>cells defined in it.<br/><br/>You might want these defined in each file; put at the *END* of your file<br/>something like:<br/><br/>    // Local Variables:<br/>    // verilog-library-files:("/some/path/technology.v" "/some/path/tech2.v")<br/>    // End:<br/><br/>Verilog-mode attempts to detect changes to this local variable, but they<br/>are only insured to be correct when the file is first visited.  Thus if you<br/>have problems, use C-x C-v RET to have these take effect.<br/><br/>See also `verilog-library-flags', `verilog-library-directories'.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
