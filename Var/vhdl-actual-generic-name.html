Specifies how actual generic names are obtained from formal generic names.</br>
In a component instantiation, an actual generic name can be</br>
obtained by modifying the formal generic name (e.g. attaching or stripping</br>
off a substring).</br>
</br>
FROM REGEXP is a regular expression matching the original name:</br>
  ".*"       matches the entire string</br>
  "\(...\)"  matches a substring</br>
TO STRING specifies the string to be inserted as new name:</br>
  "\&"  means substitute entire matched text</br>
  "\N"  means substitute what matched the Nth "\(...\)"</br>
Examples:</br>
  ".*"           "\&"    inserts original string</br>
  ".*"           "\&_i"  attaches "_i" to original string</br>
  "\(.*\)_[io]$" "\1"    strips off "_i" or "_o" from original string</br>
  ".*"           "foo"   inserts constant string "foo"</br>
  ".*"           ""      inserts empty string</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
