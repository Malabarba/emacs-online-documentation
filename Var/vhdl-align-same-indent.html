<strong>vhdl-align-same-indent</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vhdl-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means align blocks with same indent separately.<br/>
When a region or the entire buffer is aligned, the code is divided into<br/>
blocks of same indent which are aligned separately (except for argument/port<br/>
lists).  This gives nicer alignment in most cases.<br/>
Option `vhdl-align-groups' still applies within these blocks.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
