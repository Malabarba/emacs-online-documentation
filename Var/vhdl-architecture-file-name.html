Specifies how the architecture file name is obtained.</br>
The architecture file name can be obtained by modifying the entity</br>
and/or architecture name (e.g. attaching or stripping off a substring).  The</br>
file extension is automatically taken from the file name of the current</br>
buffer.  The string that is matched against the regexp is the concatenation</br>
of the entity and the architecture name separated by a space.  This gives</br>
access to both names (see default setting as example).</br>
</br>
FROM REGEXP is a regular expression matching the original name:</br>
  ".*"       matches the entire string</br>
  "\(...\)"  matches a substring</br>
TO STRING specifies the string to be inserted as new name:</br>
  "\&"  means substitute entire matched text</br>
  "\N"  means substitute what matched the Nth "\(...\)"</br>
Examples:</br>
  ".*"           "\&"    inserts original string</br>
  ".*"           "\&_i"  attaches "_i" to original string</br>
  "\(.*\)_[io]$" "\1"    strips off "_i" or "_o" from original string</br>
  ".*"           "foo"   inserts constant string "foo"</br>
  ".*"           ""      inserts empty string</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
