<strong>vhdl-compile-use-local-error-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vhdl-mode.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means use buffer-local `compilation-error-regexp-alist'.<br/>
In this case, only error message regexps for VHDL compilers are active if<br/>
compilation is started from a VHDL buffer.  Otherwise, the error message<br/>
regexps are appended to the predefined global regexps, and all regexps are<br/>
active all the time.  Note that by doing that, the predefined global regexps<br/>
might result in erroneous parsing of error messages for some VHDL compilers.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Activate the new setting by restarting Emacs.<br/>

You can customize this variable.
