<strong>vhdl-compile-use-local-error-regexp</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vhdl-mode.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means use buffer-local `compilation-error-regexp-alist'.</br>
In this case, only error message regexps for VHDL compilers are active if</br>
compilation is started from a VHDL buffer.  Otherwise, the error message</br>
regexps are appended to the predefined global regexps, and all regexps are</br>
active all the time.  Note that by doing that, the predefined global regexps</br>
might result in erroneous parsing of error messages for some VHDL compilers.</br>
</br>
NOTE: Activate the new setting by restarting Emacs.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 25.1 of Emacs.
