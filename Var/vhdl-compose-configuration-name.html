Documentation:<br/>
Specifies how the configuration name is obtained.<br/>
The configuration name can be obtained by modifying the entity and/or<br/>
architecture name (e.g. attaching or stripping off a substring).  The string<br/>
that is matched against the regexp is the concatenation of the entity and the<br/>
architecture name separated by a space.  This gives access to both names (see<br/>
default setting as example).<br/>
<br/>
FROM REGEXP is a regular expression matching the original name:<br/>
  ".*"       matches the entire string<br/>
  "\(...\)"  matches a substring<br/>
TO STRING specifies the string to be inserted as new name:<br/>
  "\&"  means substitute entire matched text<br/>
  "\N"  means substitute what matched the Nth "\(...\)"<br/>
Examples:<br/>
  ".*"           "\&"    inserts original string<br/>
  ".*"           "\&_i"  attaches "_i" to original string<br/>
  "\(.*\)_[io]$" "\1"    strips off "_i" or "_o" from original string<br/>
  ".*"           "foo"   inserts constant string "foo"<br/>
  ".*"           ""      inserts empty string<br/>
