Documentation:<br/>
Specifies how an instance name is obtained.<br/>
The instance name can be obtained by modifying the name of the component to be<br/>
instantiated (e.g. attaching or stripping off a substring).  "%d" is replaced<br/>
by a unique number (starting with 1).<br/>
If TO STRING is empty, the instance name is queried.<br/>
<br/>
FROM REGEXP is a regular expression matching the original name:<br/>
  ".*"       matches the entire string<br/>
  "\(...\)"  matches a substring<br/>
TO STRING specifies the string to be inserted as new name:<br/>
  "\&"  means substitute entire matched text<br/>
  "\N"  means substitute what matched the Nth "\(...\)"<br/>
Examples:<br/>
  ".*"           "\&"    inserts original string<br/>
  ".*"           "\&_i"  attaches "_i" to original string<br/>
  "\(.*\)_[io]$" "\1"    strips off "_i" or "_o" from original string<br/>
  ".*"           "foo"   inserts constant string "foo"<br/>
  ".*"           ""      inserts empty string<br/>
