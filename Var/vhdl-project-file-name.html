vhdl-project-file-name is a variable defined in `vhdl-mode.el'.<br/>Its value is ("\\1.prj")<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of file names/paths for importing/exporting project setups.<br/>"\1" is replaced by the project name (SPC is replaced by `_'), "\2" is<br/>replaced by the user name (allows to have user-specific project setups).<br/>The first entry is used as file name to import/export individual project<br/>setups.  All entries are used to automatically import project setups at<br/>startup (see option `vhdl-project-auto-load').  Projects loaded from the<br/>first entry are automatically made current.  Hint: specify local project<br/>setups in first entry, global setups in following entries; loading a local<br/>project setup will make it current, while loading the global setups<br/>is done without changing the current project.<br/>Names can also have an absolute path (i.e. project setups can be stored<br/>in global directories).<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.
