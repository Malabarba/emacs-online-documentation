<strong>vhdl-project-file-name</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>vhdl-mode.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>("\\1.prj")</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of file names/paths for importing/exporting project setups.</br>
"\1" is replaced by the project name (SPC is replaced by `_'), "\2" is</br>
replaced by the user name (allows you to have user-specific project setups).</br>
The first entry is used as file name to import/export individual project</br>
setups.  All entries are used to automatically import project setups at</br>
startup (see option `vhdl-project-auto-load').  Projects loaded from the</br>
first entry are automatically made current.  Hint: specify local project</br>
setups in first entry, global setups in following entries; loading a local</br>
project setup will make it current, while loading the global setups</br>
is done without changing the current project.</br>
Names can also have an absolute path (i.e. project setups can be stored</br>
in global directories).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
