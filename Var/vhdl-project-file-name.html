<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of file names/paths for importing/exporting project setups.</br>
"\1" is replaced by the project name (SPC is replaced by `_'), "\2" is</br>
replaced by the user name (allows you to have user-specific project setups).</br>
The first entry is used as file name to import/export individual project</br>
setups.  All entries are used to automatically import project setups at</br>
startup (see option `vhdl-project-auto-load').  Projects loaded from the</br>
first entry are automatically made current.  Hint: specify local project</br>
setups in first entry, global setups in following entries; loading a local</br>
project setup will make it current, while loading the global setups</br>
is done without changing the current project.</br>
Names can also have an absolute path (i.e. project setups can be stored</br>
in global directories).</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>. Content under GPL as a part of GNU Emacs.</small></body></html>
