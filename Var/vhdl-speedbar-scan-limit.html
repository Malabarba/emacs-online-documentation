Limits scanning of large files and netlists.</br>
Design units: maximum file size to scan for design units</br>
Hierarchy (instances of subcomponents):</br>
  File size: maximum file size to scan for instances (in bytes)</br>
  Instances per arch: maximum number of instances to scan per architecture</br>
</br>
"None" always means that there is no limit.</br>
In case of files not or incompletely scanned, a warning message and the file</br>
names are printed out.</br>
Background: scanning for instances is considerably slower than scanning for</br>
design units, especially when there are many instances.  These limits should</br>
prevent the scanning of large netlists.</br>
