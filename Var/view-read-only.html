<strong>view-read-only</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Non-nil means buffers visiting files read-only do so in view mode.<br/>
In fact, this means that all read-only buffers normally have<br/>
View mode enabled, including buffers that are read-only because<br/>
you visit a file you cannot alter, and buffers you make read-only<br/>
using M-x toggle-read-only.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
