<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means buffers visiting files read-only do so in view mode.</br>
In fact, this means that all read-only buffers normally have</br>
View mode enabled, including buffers that are read-only because</br>
you visit a file you cannot alter, and buffers you make read-only</br>
using C-x C-q.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
