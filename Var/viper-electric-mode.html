If t, electrify Viper.</br>
Currently, this only electrifies auto-indentation, making it appropriate to the</br>
mode of the buffer.</br>
This means that auto-indentation will depart from standard Vi and will indent</br>
appropriate to the mode of the buffer.  This is especially useful for editing</br>
programs and LaTeX documents.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
