Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>

If t, Ex-style behavior while editing in Vi command and insert states.</br>
`Backspace' and `Delete' don't cross line boundaries in insert.</br>
`X' and `x' can't delete characters across line boundary in Vi, etc.</br>
Note: this doesn't preclude `Backspace' and `Delete' from deleting characters</br>
by moving past the insertion point.  This is a feature, not a bug.</br>
</br>
If nil, the above commands can work across lines.</br>
</br>
