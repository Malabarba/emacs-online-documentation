<strong>viper-ex-style-editing</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>viper-init.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If t, Ex-style behavior while editing in Vi command and insert states.<br/>
`Backspace' and `Delete' don't cross line boundaries in insert.<br/>
`X' and `x' can't delete characters across line boundary in Vi, etc.<br/>
Note: this doesn't preclude `Backspace' and `Delete' from deleting characters<br/>
by moving past the insertion point.  This is a feature, not a bug.<br/>
<br/>
If nil, the above commands can work across lines.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
