<strong>viper-no-multiple-ESC</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>viper-keym.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is t<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If true, multiple ESC in Vi mode will cause bell to ring.<br/>
This is set to t on a windowing terminal and to 'twice on a dumb<br/>
terminal (unless the user level is 1, 2, or 5).  On a dumb terminal, this<br/>
enables cursor keys and is generally more convenient, as terminals usually<br/>
don't have a convenient Meta key.<br/>
Setting viper-no-multiple-ESC to nil will allow as many multiple ESC,<br/>
as is allowed by the major mode in effect.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
