List of suffixes that Viper tries to append to filenames ending with a `.'.</br>
This is useful when the current directory contains files with the same</br>
prefix and many different suffixes.  Usually, only one of the suffixes</br>
represents an editable file.  However, file completion will stop at the `.'</br>
The smart suffix feature lets you hit RET in such a case, and Viper will</br>
select the appropriate suffix.</br>
</br>
Suffixes are tried in the order given and the first suffix for which a</br>
corresponding file exists is selected.  If no file exists for any of the</br>
suffixes, the user is asked to confirm.</br>
</br>
To turn this feature off, set this variable to nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
