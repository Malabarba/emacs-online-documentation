Its value is <pre>reformed-vi</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Syntax type characterizing Viper's alphanumeric symbols.</br>
Affects movement and change commands that deal with Vi-style words.</br>
Works best when set in the hooks to various major modes.</br>
</br>
`strict-vi' means Viper words are (hopefully) exactly as in Vi.</br>
</br>
`reformed-vi' means Viper words are like Emacs words (as determined using</br>
Emacs syntax tables, which are different for different major modes) with two</br>
exceptions: the symbol `_' is always part of a word and typical Vi non-word</br>
symbols, such as `,',:,",),{, etc., are excluded.</br>
This behaves very close to `strict-vi', but also works well with non-ASCII</br>
characters from various alphabets.</br>
</br>
`extended' means Viper word constituents are symbols that are marked as being</br>
parts of words OR symbols in Emacs syntax tables.</br>
This is most appropriate for major modes intended for editing programs.</br>
</br>
`emacs' means Viper words are the same as Emacs words as specified by Emacs</br>
syntax tables.</br>
This option is appropriate if you like Emacs-style words.</br>
