<strong>visual-order-cursor-movement</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>bindings.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, moving cursor with arrow keys follows the visual order.</br>
</br>
When this is non-nil, <right> will move to the character that is</br>
to the right of point on display, and <left> will move to the left,</br>
disregarding the surrounding bidirectional context.  Depending on the</br>
bidirectional context of the surrounding characters, this can move point</br>
many buffer positions away.</br>
</br>
When the text is entirely left-to-right, logical-order and visual-order</br>
cursor movements produce identical results.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
