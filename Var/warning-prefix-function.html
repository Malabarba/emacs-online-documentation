Function to generate warning prefixes.<br/>
This function, if non-nil, is called with two arguments,<br/>
the severity level and its entry in `warning-levels',<br/>
and should return the entry that should actually be used.<br/>
The warnings buffer is current when this function is called<br/>
and the function can insert text in it.  This text becomes<br/>
the beginning of the warning.
