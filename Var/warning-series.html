Non-nil means treat multiple `display-warning' calls as a series.</br>
A marker indicates a position in the warnings buffer</br>
which is the start of the current series; it means that</br>
additional warnings in the same buffer should not move point.</br>
If t, the next warning begins a series (and stores a marker here).</br>
A symbol with a function definition is like t, except</br>
also call that function before the next warning.
