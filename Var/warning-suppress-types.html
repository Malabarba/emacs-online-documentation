<strong>warning-suppress-types</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>warnings.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
List of warning types not to display immediately.</br>
If any element of this list matches the TYPE argument to `display-warning',</br>
the warning is logged nonetheless, but the warnings buffer is</br>
not immediately displayed.</br>
The element must match an initial segment of the list TYPE.</br>
Thus, (foo bar) as an element matches (foo bar)</br>
or (foo bar ANYTHING...) as TYPE.</br>
If TYPE is a symbol FOO, that is equivalent to the list (FOO),</br>
so only the element (FOO) will match it.</br>
See also `warning-suppress-log-types'.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
