<strong>wdired-allow-to-change-permissions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>wdired.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, the permissions bits of the files are editable.</br>
</br>
If t, to change a single bit, put the cursor over it and press the</br>
space bar, or left click over it.  You can also hit the letter you want</br>
to set: if this value is allowed, the character in the buffer will be</br>
changed.  Anyway, the point is advanced one position, so, for example,</br>
you can keep the <x> key pressed to give execution permissions to</br>
everybody to that file.</br>
</br>
If `advanced', the bits are freely editable.  You can use</br>
`string-rectangle', `query-replace', etc.  You can put any value (even</br>
newlines), but if you want your changes to be useful, you better put a</br>
intelligible value.</br>
</br>
Anyway, the real change of the permissions is done by the external</br>
program `dired-chmod-program', which must exist.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
