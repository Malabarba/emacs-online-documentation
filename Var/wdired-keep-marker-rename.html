Controls marking of files renamed in WDired.</br>
If t, files keep their previous marks when they are renamed.</br>
If a character, renamed files (whether previously marked or not)</br>
are afterward marked with that character.</br>
This option affects only files renamed by `wdired-finish-edit'.</br>
See `dired-keep-marker-rename' if you want to do the same for files</br>
renamed by `dired-do-rename' and `dired-do-rename-regexp'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
