Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>

<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If t, the "up" and "down" movement works as in Dired mode.</br>
That is, always move the point to the beginning of the filename at line.</br>
</br>
If `sometimes', only move to the beginning of filename if the point is</br>
before it, and `track-eol' is non-nil.  This behavior is very handy</br>
when editing several filenames.</br>
</br>
If nil, "up" and "down" movement is done as in any other buffer.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
