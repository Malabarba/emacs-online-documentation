<strong>wdired-use-dired-vertical-movement</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>wdired.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If t, the "up" and "down" movement works as in Dired mode.<br/>
That is, always move the point to the beginning of the filename at line.<br/>
<br/>
If `sometimes', only move to the beginning of filename if the point is<br/>
before it, and `track-eol' is non-nil.  This behavior is very handy<br/>
when editing several filenames.<br/>
<br/>
If nil, "up" and "down" movement is done as in any other buffer.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.
