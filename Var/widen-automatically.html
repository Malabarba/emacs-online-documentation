<strong>widen-automatically</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>simple.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means it is ok for commands to call `widen' when they want to.</br>
Some commands will do this in order to go to positions outside</br>
the current accessible part of the buffer.</br>
</br>
If `widen-automatically' is nil, these commands will do something else</br>
as a fallback, and won't change the buffer bounds.
