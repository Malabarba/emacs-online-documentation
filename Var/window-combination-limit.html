window-combination-limit is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is window-size<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>If non-nil, splitting a window makes a new parent window.<br/>The following values are recognized:<br/><br/>nil means splitting a window will create a new parent window only if the<br/>    window has no parent window or the window shall become part of a<br/>    combination orthogonal to the one it is part of.<br/><br/>`window-size' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer<br/>    makes a new parent window provided `display-buffer' is supposed to<br/>    explicitly set the window's size due to the presence of a<br/>    `window-height' or `window-width' entry in the alist used by<br/>    `display-buffer'.  Otherwise, this value is handled like nil.<br/><br/>`temp-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a temporary<br/>    buffer always makes a new parent window.  Otherwise, this value is<br/>    handled like nil.<br/><br/>`display-buffer' means that splitting a window for displaying a buffer<br/>    always makes a new parent window.  Since temporary buffers are<br/>    displayed by the function `display-buffer', this value is stronger<br/>    than `temp-buffer'.  Splitting a window for other purpose makes a<br/>    new parent window only if needed.<br/><br/>t means that splitting a window always creates a new parent window.  If<br/>    all splits behave this way, each frame's window tree is a binary<br/>    tree and every window but the frame's root window has exactly one<br/>    sibling.<br/><br/>Other values are reserved for future use.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 24.3 of Emacs.<br/>
