<strong>window-combination-resize</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
If t, resize window combinations proportionally.<br/>
If this variable is nil, splitting a window gets the entire screen space<br/>
for displaying the new window from the window to split.  Deleting and<br/>
resizing a window preferably resizes one adjacent window only.<br/>
<br/>
If this variable is t, splitting a window tries to get the space<br/>
proportionally from all windows in the same combination.  This also<br/>
allows to split a window that is otherwise too small or of fixed size.<br/>
Resizing and deleting a window proportionally resize all windows in the<br/>
same combination.<br/>
<br/>
Other values are reserved for future use.<br/>

This variable takes no effect if `window-combination-limit' is non-nil.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
