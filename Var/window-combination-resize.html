<strong>window-combination-resize</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If t, resize window combinations proportionally.</br>
If this variable is nil, splitting a window gets the entire screen space</br>
for displaying the new window from the window to split.  Deleting and</br>
resizing a window preferably resizes one adjacent window only.</br>
</br>
If this variable is t, splitting a window tries to get the space</br>
proportionally from all windows in the same combination.  This also</br>
allows to split a window that is otherwise too small or of fixed size.</br>
Resizing and deleting a window proportionally resize all windows in the</br>
same combination.</br>
</br>
Other values are reserved for future use.</br>
</br>
This variable takes no effect if the variable `window-combination-limit' is</br>
non-nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
