window-min-height is a variable defined in `window.el'.<br/>Its value is 4<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>The minimum number of lines of any window.<br/>The value has to accommodate a mode- or header-line if present.<br/>A value less than `window-safe-min-height' is ignored.  The value<br/>of this variable is honored when windows are resized or split.<br/><br/>Applications should never rebind this variable.  To resize a<br/>window to a height less than the one specified here, an<br/>application should instead call `window-resize' with a non-nil<br/>IGNORE argument.  In order to have `split-window' make a window<br/>shorter, explicitly specify the SIZE argument of that function.<br/><br/>You can customize this variable.<br/><br/>This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
