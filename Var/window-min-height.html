<strong>window-min-height</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>4</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The minimum total height, in lines, of any window.</br>
The value has to accommodate one text line, a mode and header</br>
line, and a bottom divider, if present.  A value less than</br>
`window-safe-min-height' is ignored.  The value of this variable</br>
is honored when windows are resized or split.</br>
</br>
Applications should never rebind this variable.  To resize a</br>
window to a height less than the one specified here, an</br>
application should instead call `window-resize' with a non-nil</br>
IGNORE argument.  In order to have `split-window' make a window</br>
shorter, explicitly specify the SIZE argument of that function.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.1 of Emacs.
