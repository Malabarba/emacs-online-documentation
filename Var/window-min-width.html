<strong>window-min-width</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>window.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 10<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The minimum number of columns of any window.<br/>
The value has to accommodate margins, fringes, or scrollbars if<br/>
present.  A value less than `window-safe-min-width' is ignored.<br/>
The value of this variable is honored when windows are resized or<br/>
split.<br/>
<br/>
Applications should never rebind this variable.  To resize a<br/>
window to a width less than the one specified here, an<br/>
application should instead call `window-resize' with a non-nil<br/>
IGNORE argument.  In order to have `split-window' make a window<br/>
narrower, explicitly specify the SIZE argument of that function.<br/>
<br/>
You can customize this variable.<br/>
<br/>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in<br/>
version 24.1 of Emacs.<br/>
