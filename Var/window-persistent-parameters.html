<strong>window-persistent-parameters</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is ((clone-of . t))<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
Alist of persistent window parameters.<br/>
This alist specifies which window parameters shall get saved by<br/>
`current-window-configuration' and `window-state-get' and subsequently<br/>
restored to their previous values by `set-window-configuration' and<br/>
`window-state-put'.<br/>
<br/>
The car of each entry of this alist is the symbol specifying the<br/>
parameter.  The cdr is one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
nil means the parameter is neither saved by `window-state-get' nor by<br/>
`current-window-configuration'.<br/>
<br/>
t means the parameter is saved by `current-window-configuration' and,<br/>
provided its WRITABLE argument is nil, by `window-state-get'.<br/>
<br/>
The symbol `writable' means the parameter is saved unconditionally by<br/>
both `current-window-configuration' and `window-state-get'.  Do not use<br/>
this value for parameters without read syntax (like windows or frames).<br/>
<br/>
Parameters not saved by `current-window-configuration' or<br/>
`window-state-get' are left alone by `set-window-configuration'<br/>
respectively are not installed by `window-state-put'.
