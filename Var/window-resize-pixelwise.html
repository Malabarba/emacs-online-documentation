<strong>window-resize-pixelwise</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means resize windows pixelwise.</br>
This currently affects the functions: `split-window', `maximize-window',</br>
`minimize-window', `fit-window-to-buffer' and `fit-frame-to-buffer', and</br>
all functions that symmetrically resize a parent window.</br>
</br>
Note that when a frame's pixel size is not a multiple of the</br>
frame's character size, at least one window may get resized</br>
pixelwise even if this option is nil.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.4 of Emacs.
