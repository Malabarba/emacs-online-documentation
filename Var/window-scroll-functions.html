List of functions to call before redisplaying a window with scrolling.</br>
Each function is called with two arguments, the window and its new</br>
display-start position.</br>
These functions are called whenever the `window-start' marker is modified,</br>
either to point into another buffer (e.g. via `set-window-buffer') or another</br>
place in the same buffer.</br>
Note that the value of `window-end' is not valid when these functions are</br>
called.</br>
</br>
Warning: Do not use this feature to alter the way the window</br>
is scrolled.  It is not designed for that, and such use probably won't</br>
work.
