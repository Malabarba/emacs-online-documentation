List of functions to call before redisplaying a window with scrolling.</br>
Each function is called with two arguments, the window and its new</br>
display-start position.  Note that these functions are also called by</br>
`set-window-buffer'.  Also note that the value of `window-end' is not</br>
valid when these functions are called.</br>
</br>
Warning: Do not use this feature to alter the way the window</br>
is scrolled.  It is not designed for that, and such use probably won't</br>
work.
