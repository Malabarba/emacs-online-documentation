Maximum number of side window slots.<br/>
The value is a list of four elements specifying the number of<br/>
side window slots on (in this order) the left, top, right and<br/>
bottom side of each frame.  If an element is a number, this means<br/>
to display at most that many side windows on the corresponding<br/>
side.  If an element is nil, this means there's no bound on the<br/>
number of slots on that side.<br/>
