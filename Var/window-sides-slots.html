Maximum number of side window slots.</br>
The value is a list of four elements specifying the number of</br>
side window slots on (in this order) the left, top, right and</br>
bottom side of each frame.  If an element is a number, this means</br>
to display at most that many side windows on the corresponding</br>
side.  If an element is nil, this means there's no bound on the</br>
number of slots on that side.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
