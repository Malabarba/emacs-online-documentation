<strong>window-size-fixed</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>window.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li></ul></br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil in a buffer means windows displaying the buffer are fixed-size.</br>
If the value is `height', then only the window's height is fixed.</br>
If the value is `width', then only the window's width is fixed.</br>
Any other non-nil value fixes both the width and the height.</br>
</br>
Emacs won't change the size of any window displaying that buffer,</br>
unless it has no other choice (like when deleting a neighboring</br>
window).
