List of functions to be called when discarding a lexical token.</br>
These functions receive the lexical token discarded.</br>
When the parser encounters unexpected tokens, it can discards them,</br>
based on what directed by error recovery rules.  Either when the</br>
parser reads tokens until one is found that can be shifted, or when an</br>
semantic action calls the function `wisent-skip-token' or</br>
`wisent-skip-block'.</br>
For language specific hooks, make sure you define this as a local</br>
hook.
