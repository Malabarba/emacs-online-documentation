<strong>woman-cache-level</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>woman.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is 2<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The level of topic caching.<br/>
1 - cache only the topic and directory lists<br/>
    (the only level before version 0.34 - only for compatibility);<br/>
2 - cache also the directories for each topic<br/>
    (faster, without using much more memory);<br/>
3 - cache also the actual filenames for each topic<br/>
    (fastest, but uses twice as much memory).<br/>
The default value is currently 2, a good general compromise.<br/>
If the `woman' command is slow to find files then try 3, which may be<br/>
particularly beneficial with large remote-mounted man directories.<br/>
Run the `woman' command with a prefix argument or delete the cache<br/>
file `woman-cache-filename' for a change to take effect.<br/>
(Values < 1 behave like 1; values > 3 behave like 3.)<br/>

You can customize this variable.
