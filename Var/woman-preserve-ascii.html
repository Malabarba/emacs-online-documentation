<strong>woman-preserve-ascii</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>woman.el</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>t</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
If non-nil, preserve ASCII characters in the WoMan buffer.</br>
Otherwise, to save time, some backslashes and spaces may be</br>
represented differently (as the values of the variables</br>
`woman-escaped-escape-char' and `woman-unpadded-space-char'</br>
respectively) so that the buffer content is strictly wrong even though</br>
it should display correctly.  This should be irrelevant unless the</br>
buffer text is searched, copied or saved to a file.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
