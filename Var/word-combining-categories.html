List of pair (cons) of categories to determine word boundary.</br>
</br>
Emacs treats a sequence of word constituent characters as a single</br>
word (i.e. finds no word boundary between them) only if they belong to</br>
the same script.  But, exceptions are allowed in the following cases.</br>
</br>
(1) The case that characters are in different scripts is controlled</br>
by the variable `word-combining-categories'.</br>
</br>
Emacs finds no word boundary between characters of different scripts</br>
if they have categories matching some element of this list.</br>
</br>
More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1</br>
and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 is followed by</br>
C2 which has CAT2, there's no word boundary between C1 and C2.</br>
</br>
For instance, to tell that Han characters followed by Hiragana</br>
characters can form a single word, the element `(?C . ?H)' should be</br>
in this list.</br>
</br>
(2) The case that character are in the same script is controlled by</br>
the variable `word-separating-categories'.</br>
</br>
Emacs finds a word boundary between characters of the same script</br>
if they have categories matching some element of this list.</br>
</br>
More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1</br>
and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 but not CAT2 is</br>
followed by C2 which has CAT2 but not CAT1, there's a word boundary</br>
between C1 and C2.</br>
</br>
For instance, to tell that there's a word boundary between Hiragana</br>
and Katakana (both are in the same script `kana'),</br>
the element `(?H . ?K) should be in this list.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
