List of pair (cons) of categories to determine word boundary.<br/>
<br/>
Emacs treats a sequence of word constituent characters as a single<br/>
word (i.e. finds no word boundary between them) only if they belong to<br/>
the same script.  But, exceptions are allowed in the following cases.<br/>
<br/>
(1) The case that characters are in different scripts is controlled<br/>
by the variable `word-combining-categories'.<br/>
<br/>
Emacs finds no word boundary between characters of different scripts<br/>
if they have categories matching some element of this list.<br/>
<br/>
More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1<br/>
and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 is followed by<br/>
C2 which has CAT2, there's no word boundary between C1 and C2.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, to tell that Han characters followed by Hiragana<br/>
characters can form a single word, the element `(?C . ?H)' should be<br/>
in this list.<br/>
<br/>
(2) The case that character are in the same script is controlled by<br/>
the variable `word-separating-categories'.<br/>
<br/>
Emacs finds a word boundary between characters of the same script<br/>
if they have categories matching some element of this list.<br/>
<br/>
More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1<br/>
and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 but not CAT2 is<br/>
followed by C2 which has CAT2 but not CAT1, there's a word boundary<br/>
between C1 and C2.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, to tell that there's a word boundary between Hiragana<br/>
and Katakana (both are in the same script `kana'),<br/>
the element `(?H . ?K) should be in this list.
