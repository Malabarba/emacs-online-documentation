<strong>word-wrap</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
<ul>  <li>Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.</li><li>  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value</br>
  satisfies the predicate `booleanp'.</li></ul></br>

Non-nil means to use word-wrapping for continuation lines.</br>
When word-wrapping is on, continuation lines are wrapped at the space</br>
or tab character nearest to the right window edge.</br>
If nil, continuation lines are wrapped at the right screen edge.</br>
</br>
This variable has no effect if long lines are truncated (see</br>
`truncate-lines' and `truncate-partial-width-windows').  If you use</br>
word-wrapping, you might want to reduce the value of</br>
`truncate-partial-width-windows', since wrapping can make text readable</br>
in narrower windows.</br>
</br>
Instead of setting this variable directly, most users should use</br>
Visual Line mode .  Visual Line mode, when enabled, sets `word-wrap'</br>
to t, and additionally redefines simple editing commands to act on</br>
visual lines rather than logical lines.  See the documentation of</br>
`visual-line-mode'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.
