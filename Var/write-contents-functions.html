write-contents-functions is a variable defined in `files.el'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.<br/>If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written<br/>and the rest are not called and neither are the functions in<br/>`write-file-functions'.<br/><br/>This variable is meant to be used for hooks that pertain to the<br/>buffer's contents, not to the particular visited file; thus,<br/>`set-visited-file-name' does not clear this variable; but changing the<br/>major mode does clear it.<br/><br/>For hooks that _do_ pertain to the particular visited file, use<br/>`write-file-functions'.  Both this variable and<br/>`write-file-functions' relate to how a buffer is saved to file.<br/>To perform various checks or updates before the buffer is saved,<br/>use `before-save-hook'.
