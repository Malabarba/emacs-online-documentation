<strong>write-contents-hooks</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.<br/>
  This variable is an alias for `write-contents-functions'.<br/>
  This variable is obsolete since 22.1;<br/>
  use `write-contents-functions' instead.<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.<br/>
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written<br/>
and the rest are not called and neither are the functions in<br/>
`write-file-functions'.<br/>
<br/>
This variable is meant to be used for hooks that pertain to the<br/>
buffer's contents, not to the particular visited file; thus,<br/>
`set-visited-file-name' does not clear this variable; but changing the<br/>
major mode does clear it.<br/>
<br/>
For hooks that _do_ pertain to the particular visited file, use<br/>
`write-file-functions'.  Both this variable and<br/>
`write-file-functions' relate to how a buffer is saved to file.<br/>
To perform various checks or updates before the buffer is saved,<br/>
use `before-save-hook'.
