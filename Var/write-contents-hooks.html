List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.</br>
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written</br>
and the rest are not called and neither are the functions in</br>
`write-file-functions'.</br>
</br>
This variable is meant to be used for hooks that pertain to the</br>
buffer's contents, not to the particular visited file; thus,</br>
`set-visited-file-name' does not clear this variable; but changing the</br>
major mode does clear it.</br>
</br>
For hooks that _do_ pertain to the particular visited file, use</br>
`write-file-functions'.  Both this variable and</br>
`write-file-functions' relate to how a buffer is saved to file.</br>
To perform various checks or updates before the buffer is saved,</br>
use `before-save-hook'.
