<strong>write-file-functions</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>files.el</code>'.<br/>
Its value is nil<br/>
<br/>
  This variable's value is permanent if it is given a local binding.<br/>
  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.<br/>
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written<br/>
and the rest are not called.<br/>
These hooks are considered to pertain to the visited file.<br/>
So any buffer-local binding of this variable is discarded if you change<br/>
the visited file name with M-x set-visited-file-name, but not when you<br/>
change the major mode.<br/>
<br/>
This hook is not run if any of the functions in<br/>
`write-contents-functions' returns non-nil.  Both hooks pertain<br/>
to how to save a buffer to file, for instance, choosing a suitable<br/>
coding system and setting mode bits.  (See Info<br/>
node `(elisp)Saving Buffers'.)  To perform various checks or<br/>
updates before the buffer is saved, use `before-save-hook'.
