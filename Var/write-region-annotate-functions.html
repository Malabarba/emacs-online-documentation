write-region-annotate-functions is a variable defined in `C source code'.<br/>Its value is nil<br/><br/>  This variable may be risky if used as a file-local variable.<br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>A list of functions to be called at the start of `write-region'.<br/>Each is passed two arguments, START and END as for `write-region'.<br/>These are usually two numbers but not always; see the documentation<br/>for `write-region'.  The function should return a list of pairs<br/>of the form (POSITION . STRING), consisting of strings to be effectively<br/>inserted at the specified positions of the file being written (1 means to<br/>insert before the first byte written).  The POSITIONs must be sorted into<br/>increasing order.<br/><br/>If there are several annotation functions, the lists returned by these<br/>functions are merged destructively.  As each annotation function runs,<br/>the variable `write-region-annotations-so-far' contains a list of all<br/>annotations returned by previous annotation functions.<br/><br/>An annotation function can return with a different buffer current.<br/>Doing so removes the annotations returned by previous functions, and<br/>resets START and END to `point-min' and `point-max' of the new buffer.<br/><br/>After `write-region' completes, Emacs calls the function stored in<br/>`write-region-post-annotation-function', once for each buffer that was<br/>current when building the annotations (i.e., at least once), with that<br/>buffer current.
