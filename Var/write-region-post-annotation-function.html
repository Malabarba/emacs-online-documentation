Function to call after `write-region' completes.<br/>
The function is called with no arguments.  If one or more of the<br/>
annotation functions in `write-region-annotate-functions' changed the<br/>
current buffer, the function stored in this variable is called for<br/>
each of those additional buffers as well, in addition to the original<br/>
buffer.  The relevant buffer is current during each function call.
