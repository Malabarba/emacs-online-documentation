Function to call after `write-region' completes.</br>
The function is called with no arguments.  If one or more of the</br>
annotation functions in `write-region-annotate-functions' changed the</br>
current buffer, the function stored in this variable is called for</br>
each of those additional buffers as well, in addition to the original</br>
buffer.  The relevant buffer is current during each function call.
