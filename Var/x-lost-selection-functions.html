A list of functions to be called when Emacs loses an X selection.</br>
(This happens when some other X client makes its own selection</br>
or when a Lisp program explicitly clears the selection.)</br>
The functions are called with one argument, the selection type</br>
(a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD').
