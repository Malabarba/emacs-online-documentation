<strong>x-mouse-click-focus-ignore-position</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
Non-nil means that a mouse click to focus a frame does not move point.</br>
This variable is only used when the window manager requires that you</br>
click on a frame to select it (give it focus).  In that case, a value</br>
of nil, means that the selected window and cursor position changes to</br>
reflect the mouse click position, while a non-nil value means that the</br>
selected window or cursor position is preserved.
