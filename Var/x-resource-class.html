<strong>x-resource-class</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.<br/>
Its value is "Emacs"<br/>
<br/>
Documentation:<br/>
The class Emacs uses to look up X resources.<br/>
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance class<br/>
when requesting resource values.<br/>
<br/>
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-class' to "Emacs".<br/>
<br/>
Setting this variable permanently is not a reasonable thing to do,<br/>
but binding this variable locally around a call to `x-get-resource'<br/>
is a reasonable practice.  See also the variable `x-resource-name'.
