Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The name Emacs uses to look up X resources.</br>
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance name</br>
when requesting resource values.</br>
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-name' to the name under which Emacs</br>
was invoked, or to the value specified with the `-name' or `-rn'</br>
switches, if present.</br>
</br>
It may be useful to bind this variable locally around a call</br>
to `x-get-resource'.  See also the variable `x-resource-class'.
