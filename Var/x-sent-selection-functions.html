A list of functions to be called when Emacs answers a selection request.<br/>
The functions are called with three arguments:<br/>
  - the selection name (typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD');<br/>
  - the selection-type which Emacs was asked to convert the<br/>
    selection into before sending (for example, `STRING' or `LENGTH');<br/>
  - a flag indicating success or failure for responding to the request.<br/>
We might have failed (and declined the request) for any number of reasons,<br/>
including being asked for a selection that we no longer own, or being asked<br/>
to convert into a type that we don't know about or that is inappropriate.<br/>
This hook doesn't let you change the behavior of Emacs's selection replies,<br/>
it merely informs you that they have happened.
