A list of functions to be called when Emacs answers a selection request.</br>
The functions are called with three arguments:</br>
  - the selection name (typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD');</br>
  - the selection-type which Emacs was asked to convert the</br>
    selection into before sending (for example, `STRING' or `LENGTH');</br>
  - a flag indicating success or failure for responding to the request.</br>
We might have failed (and declined the request) for any number of reasons,</br>
including being asked for a selection that we no longer own, or being asked</br>
to convert into a type that we don't know about or that is inappropriate.</br>
This hook doesn't let you change the behavior of Emacs's selection replies,</br>
it merely informs you that they have happened.
