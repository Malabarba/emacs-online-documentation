<strong>x-session-previous-id</strong> is a variable defined in `<code>C source code</code>'.</br>
Its value is <pre>nil</pre></br>
</br>
<strong id="documentation">Documentation:</strong></br>
The previous session id Emacs got from session manager.</br>
If Emacs is running on a window system that has a session manager, the</br>
session manager gives Emacs a session id.  It is feasible for Emacs Lisp</br>
code to use the session id to save configuration in, for example, a file</br>
with a file name based on the session id.  If Emacs is running when the</br>
window system is shut down, the session manager remembers that Emacs was</br>
running and saves the session id Emacs had.</br>
</br>
When the window system is started again, the session manager restarts</br>
Emacs and hands Emacs the session id it had the last time it was</br>
running.  This is now the previous session id and the value of this</br>
variable.  If configuration was saved in a file as stated above, the</br>
previous session id shall be used to reconstruct the file name.</br>
</br>
The session id Emacs has while it is running is in the variable</br>
`x-session-id'.  The value of this variable and `x-session-id' may be the</br>
same, depending on how the session manager works.</br>
