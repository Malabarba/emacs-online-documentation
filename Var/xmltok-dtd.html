Documentation:<br/>
Information about the DTD used by `xmltok-forward'.<br/>
`xmltok-forward-prolog' sets this up.<br/>
<br/>
It consists of an alist of general entity names vs definitions.  The<br/>
first member of the alist is t if references to entities not in the<br/>
alist are well-formed (e.g. because there's an external subset that<br/>
wasn't parsed).<br/>
<br/>
Each general entity name is a string.  The definition is either nil,<br/>
a symbol, a string, a cons cell.  If the definition is nil, then it<br/>
means that it's an internal entity but the result of parsing it is<br/>
unknown.  If it is a symbol, then the symbol is either `unparsed',<br/>
meaning the entity is an unparsed entity, `external', meaning the<br/>
entity is or references an external entity, `element', meaning the<br/>
entity includes one or more elements, or `not-well-formed', meaning<br/>
the replacement text is not well-formed.  If the definition is a<br/>
string, then the replacement text of the entity is that string; this<br/>
happens only during the parsing of the prolog.  If the definition is<br/>
a cons cell (ER . AR), then ER specifies the string that results<br/>
from referencing the entity in element content and AR is either nil,<br/>
meaning the replacement text included a <, or a string which is the<br/>
normalized attribute value.
