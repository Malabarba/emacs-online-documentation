Information about the DTD used by `xmltok-forward'.</br>
`xmltok-forward-prolog' sets this up.</br>
</br>
It consists of an alist of general entity names vs definitions.  The</br>
first member of the alist is t if references to entities not in the</br>
alist are well-formed (e.g. because there's an external subset that</br>
wasn't parsed).</br>
</br>
Each general entity name is a string.  The definition is either nil,</br>
a symbol, a string, a cons cell.  If the definition is nil, then it</br>
means that it's an internal entity but the result of parsing it is</br>
unknown.  If it is a symbol, then the symbol is either `unparsed',</br>
meaning the entity is an unparsed entity, `external', meaning the</br>
entity is or references an external entity, `element', meaning the</br>
entity includes one or more elements, or `not-well-formed', meaning</br>
the replacement text is not well-formed.  If the definition is a</br>
string, then the replacement text of the entity is that string; this</br>
happens only during the parsing of the prolog.  If the definition is</br>
a cons cell (ER . AR), then ER specifies the string that results</br>
from referencing the entity in element content and AR is either nil,</br>
meaning the replacement text included a <, or a string which is the</br>
normalized attribute value.<br/><br/><br/><br/><small>A courtesy of <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a>.</small></body></html>
