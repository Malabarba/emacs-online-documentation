List of special text property handling conditions for yanking.</br>
Each element should have the form (PROP . FUN), where PROP is a</br>
property symbol and FUN is a function.  When the `yank' command</br>
inserts text into the buffer, it scans the inserted text for</br>
stretches of text that have `eq' values of the text property</br>
PROP; for each such stretch of text, FUN is called with three</br>
arguments: the property's value in that text, and the start and</br>
end positions of the text.</br>
</br>
This is done prior to removing the properties specified by</br>
`yank-excluded-properties'.</br>
</br>
You can customize this variable.</br>
</br>
This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 24.3 of Emacs.
