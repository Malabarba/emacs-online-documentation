Whether rotating the kill ring changes the window system selection.</br>
If non-nil, whenever the kill ring is rotated (usually via the</br>
`yank-pop' command), Emacs also calls `interprogram-cut-function'</br>
to copy the new kill to the window system selection.</br>

You can customize this variable.</br>

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
