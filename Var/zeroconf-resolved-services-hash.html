zeroconf-resolved-services-hash is a variable defined in `zeroconf.el'.<br/>Its value is #s(hash-table size 65 test equal rehash-size 1.5 rehash-threshold 0.8 data<br/>	      ())<br/><br/><br/>Documentation:<br/>Hash table of resolved Avahi services.<br/>The key of an entry is the concatenation of the service name and<br/>service type of a resolved service.  The value is the service<br/>itself.  The format of a service is<br/><br/>  (INTERFACE PROTOCOL NAME TYPE DOMAIN HOST APROTOCOL ADDRESS PORT TXT FLAGS)<br/><br/>INTERFACE, PROTOCOL, NAME, TYPE, DOMAIN and FLAGS have the same<br/>meaning as in `zeroconf-services-hash'.<br/><br/>HOST is the host name the service is registered.  It is a fully<br/>qualified name, i.e., it contains DOMAIN.<br/><br/>APROTOCOL stands for the network protocol family ADDRESS is<br/>encoded (`zeroconf-avahi-protocol-inet4' means INET4,<br/>`zeroconf-avahi-protocol-inet6' means INET6).  It can be<br/>different from PROTOCOL, when an address resolution has been<br/>requested for another protocol family but the default one.<br/><br/>ADDRESS is the service address, encoded according to the<br/>APROTOCOL network protocol family.  PORT is the corresponding<br/>port the service can be reached on ADDRESS.<br/><br/>TXT is an array of strings, describing additional attributes of<br/>the service.  Usually, every string is a key=value pair.  The<br/>supported keys depend on the service type.
