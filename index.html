<h2>Now with an Android App!</h2>
<p>The app is free, and <a href="app.html">available here</a>. It only
  requires internet permission (for accessing the doc strings in this
  website), so you should feel safe to use it. If you still don't
  trust me,
  <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/emacs-documentation-android/">
    here's the source code</a>.</p>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is <em>not</em> a copy of the Emacs manual, or the
  elisp reference.</p>

<p>This is a list of all functions, variables and faces defined in
  the latest Emacs version, with links to their respective
  built-in documentations. This documentation is the one you
  get by
  calling <code>describe-function</code>, <code>describe-variable</code>
  or <code>describe-face</code>.</p>

<h2>Wait, so everything in here is already inside Emacs?</h2>          
<p>Yes, the information contained here is easily accessible
  from inside Emacs. In fact, it is generated directly from
  the latest stable version of Emacs.</p>

<h2>Then what's the point?</h2>
<p>The point is that this information wasn't available
  anywhere online. Many functions are documented in the elisp
  reference, and others are explained in the Emacs manual,
  but most weren't described anywhere at all.</p>
<p>By making it available here you can easily link to it from your
  geeky Emacs blog
  (see <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/Checkdoc%252C-Package-Developing%252C-and-Cakes.html">
    Endless Parentheses</a> or
  <a href="http://www.lunaryorn.com/2014/03/26/search-based-fontification-with-keywords.html">
    lunarsite</a>, for instance).</p>
<p>I frequently missed having this information at hand,
  because even when I'm away from the computer I'm usualy
  thinking about Emacs (obsessive, I know). That's why I
  decided to make it available somewhere outside Emacs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="variables.html#variables">Here are the Variables</a></li>
  <li><a href="functions.html#functions">Here are the Functions</a></li>
  <li><a href="faces.html#faces">Here are the Faces</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Can I borrow this from you?</h2>
<p>The information contained here is not mine, being a part
  of Emacs it is available under
  the <a href="http://www.free-soft.org/gpl_history/emacs_gpl.html">GPL
    License</a>. I didn't write these documentations, I simply
  generate the HTML pages and maintain this website.</p>
<p>If you want to use the HTML files for something, download
  links are below, but please reference where you got
  them.</p>

<h2>I found a missing/buggy/outdated page, how do I help?</h2>
<p>Thanks a lot for the help. Just
  <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/emacs-online-documentation/issues/new">open an issue here on github</a>.</p>
